                  <p>Achieving reliable and safe autonomous driving in off-road environments requires accurate and efficient terrain traversability analysis.However, this task faces several challenges, including the scarcity of large-scale datasets tailored for off-road scenarios, the high cost and potential errors of manual annotation, the stringent real-time requirements of motion planning, and the limited computational power of onboard units.To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel traversability learning method that leverages self-supervised learning, eliminating the need for manual annotation.For the first time, a Birds-Eye View (BEV) representation is used as input, reducing computational burden and improving adaptability to downstream motion planning.During vehicle operation, the proposed method conducts online analysis of traversed regions and dynamically updates prototypes to adaptively assess the traversability of the current environment, effectively handling dynamic scene changes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate our approach against state-of-the-art benchmarks on both public datasets and our own dataset, covering diverse seasons and geographical locations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.705</span></span>Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms recent approaches.Additionally, real-world vehicle experiments show that our method operates at 10 Hz, meeting real-time requirements, while a 5.5 km autonomous driving experiment further validates the generated traversability cost maps compatibility with downstream motion planning.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models are accelerating the development of Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents that utilize human-like vision perception capabilities to enhance productivity on digital devices.Compared to approaches predicated on GUI metadata, which are platform-dependent and vulnerable to implementation variations, vision-based approaches offer broader applicability.In this vision-based paradigm, the GUI instruction grounding, which maps user instruction to the location of corresponding element on the given screenshot, remains a critical challenge, particularly due to limited public training dataset and resource-intensive manual instruction data annotation.In this paper, we delve into unexplored challenges in this task including element-to-screen ratio, unbalanced element type, and implicit instruction.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address these challenges, we introduce a large-scale data synthesis pipeline UI-E2I-Synth for generating varying complex instruction datasets using GPT-4o instead of human annotators. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.754</span></span>Furthermore, we propose a new GUI instruction grounding benchmark UI-I2E-Bench, which is designed to address the limitations of existing benchmarks by incorporating diverse annotation aspects.Our model, trained on the synthesized data, achieves superior performance in GUI instruction grounding, demonstrating the advancements of proposed data synthesis pipeline.The proposed benchmark, accompanied by extensive analyses, provides practical insights for future research in GUI grounding.We will release corresponding artifacts at https://colmon46.github.io/i2e-bench-leaderboard/</p>

                  <p>Multimodal Foundation Models (MFMs) excel at representing diverse raw modalities (e.g., text, images, audio, videos, etc.).As recommender systems increasingly incorporate these modalities, leveraging MFMs to generate better representations has great potential.However, their application in sequential recommendation remains largely unexplored.This is primarily because mainstream adaptation methods, such as Fine-Tuning and even Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques (e.g., Adapter and LoRA), incur high computational costs, especially when integrating multiple modality encoders, thus hindering research progress.As a result, it remains unclear whether we can efficiently and effectively adapt multiple (>2) MFMs for the sequential recommendation task.   To address this, we propose a plug-and-play Cross-modal Side Adapter Network (CROSSAN).Leveraging the fully decoupled side adapter-based paradigm, CROSSAN achieves high efficiency while enabling cross-modal learning across diverse modalities.To optimize the final stage of multimodal fusion across diverse modalities, we adopt the Mixture of Modality Expert Fusion (MOMEF) mechanism.CROSSAN achieves superior performance on the public datasets for adapting four foundation models with raw modalities.Performance consistently improves as more MFMs are adapted.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We will release our code and datasets to facilitate future research. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.836</span></span></p>

By leveraging structural and semantic features with pre- trained 2D image generation models and a VLM-based realism evaluation, Art3D successfully enhances the three-dimensional illusion in reference images, thus simplifying the process of generating 3D from 2D, and proves adaptable to a wide range of painting styles.To benchmark the generalization performance of existing image-to-3D models on flat-colored images without 3D feeling, we collect a new dataset, Flat-2D, with over 100 samples.Experimental results demonstrate the performance and robustness of Art3D, exhibiting superior generalizable capacity and promising practical applicability.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our source code and dataset will be publicly available on our project page: https://joy-jy11.github.io/ . <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.905</span></span></p>

                  <p>Physically distributed components and legacy protocols make the protection of power grids against increasing cyberattack threats challenging.Infamously, the 2015 and 2016 blackouts in Ukraine were caused by cyberattacks, and the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) recorded over 200 cyber incidents against the German energy sector between 2023 and 2024.Intrusion detection promises to quickly detect such attacks and mitigate the worst consequences.However, public datasets of realistic scenarios are vital to evaluate these systems.This paper introduces Sherlock, a dataset generated with the co-simulator Wattson.In total, Sherlock covers three scenarios with various attacks manipulating the process state by injecting malicious commands or manipulating measurement values.We additionally test five recently-published intrusion detection systems on Sherlock, highlighting specific challenges for intrusion detection in power grids.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Dataset and documentation are available at https://sherlock.wattson.it/. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.832</span></span></p>

                  <p>Precise vehicle state estimation is crucial for safe and reliable autonomous driving.The number of measurable states and their precision offered by the onboard vehicle sensor system are often constrained by cost.For instance, measuring critical quantities such as the Vehicle Sideslip Angle (VSA) poses significant commercial challenges using current optical sensors.This paper addresses these limitations by focusing on the development of high-performance virtual sensors to enhance vehicle state estimation for active safety.The proposed Uncertainty-Aware Hybrid Learning (UAHL) architecture integrates a machine learning model with vehicle motion models to estimate VSA directly from onboard sensor data.A key aspect of the UAHL architecture is its focus on uncertainty quantification for individual model estimates and hybrid fusion.These mechanisms enable the dynamic weighting of uncertainty-aware predictions from machine learning and vehicle motion models to produce accurate and reliable hybrid VSA estimates.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This work also presents a novel dataset named Real-world Vehicle State Estimation Dataset (ReV-StED), comprising synchronized measurements from advanced vehicle dynamic sensors. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.735</span></span>The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method for VSA estimation, highlighting UAHL as a promising architecture for advancing virtual sensors and enhancing active safety in autonomous vehicles.</p>

                  <p>While many EDA tasks already involve graph-based data, existing LLMs in EDA primarily either represent graphs as sequential text, or simply ignore graph-structured data that might be beneficial like dataflow graphs of RTL code.Recent studies have found that LLM performance suffers when graphs are represented as sequential text, and using additional graph information significantly boosts performance.To address these challenges, we introduce BRIDGES, a framework designed to incorporate graph modality into LLMs for EDA tasks.BRIDGES integrates an automated data generation workflow, a solution that combines graph modality with LLM, and a comprehensive evaluation suite.First, we establish an LLM-driven workflow to generate RTL and netlist-level data, converting them into dataflow and netlist graphs with function descriptions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This workflow yields a large-scale dataset comprising over 500,000 graph instances and more than 1.5 billion tokens. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.75</span></span>Second, we propose a lightweight cross-modal projector that encodes graph representations into text-compatible prompts, enabling LLMs to effectively utilize graph data without architectural modifications.Experimental results demonstrate 2x to 10x improvements across multiple tasks compared to text-only baselines, including accuracy in design retrieval, type prediction and perplexity in function description, with negligible computational overhead (<1% model weights increase and <30% additional runtime overhead).Even without additional LLM finetuning, our results outperform text-only by a large margin.We plan to release BRIDGES, including the dataset, models, and training flow.</p>

                  <p>Micro-Action Recognition (MAR) aims to classify subtle human actions in video.However, annotating MAR datasets is particularly challenging due to the subtlety of actions.To this end, we introduce the setting of Semi-Supervised MAR (SSMAR), where only a part of samples are labeled.We first evaluate traditional Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods to SSMAR and find that these methods tend to overfit on inaccurate pseudo-labels, leading to error accumulation and degraded performance.This issue primarily arises from the common practice of directly using the predictions of classifier as pseudo-labels to train the model.To solve this issue, we propose a novel framework, called Asynchronous Pseudo Labeling and Training (APLT), which explicitly separates the pseudo-labeling process from model training.Specifically, we introduce a semi-supervised clustering method during the offline pseudo-labeling phase to generate more accurate pseudo-labels.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, a self-adaptive thresholding strategy is proposed to dynamically filter noisy labels of different classes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.657</span></span>We then build a memory-based prototype classifier based on the filtered pseudo-labels, which is fixed and used to guide the subsequent model training phase.By alternating the two pseudo-labeling and model training phases in an asynchronous manner, the model can not only be learned with more accurate pseudo-labels but also avoid the overfitting issue.Experiments on three MAR datasets show that our APLT largely outperforms state-of-the-art SSL methods.For instance, APLT improves accuracy by 14.5\% over FixMatch on the MA-12 dataset when using only 50\% labeled data.Code will be publicly available.</p>

                  <p>Achieving reliable and safe autonomous driving in off-road environments requires accurate and efficient terrain traversability analysis.However, this task faces several challenges, including the scarcity of large-scale datasets tailored for off-road scenarios, the high cost and potential errors of manual annotation, the stringent real-time requirements of motion planning, and the limited computational power of onboard units.To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel traversability learning method that leverages self-supervised learning, eliminating the need for manual annotation.For the first time, a Birds-Eye View (BEV) representation is used as input, reducing computational burden and improving adaptability to downstream motion planning.During vehicle operation, the proposed method conducts online analysis of traversed regions and dynamically updates prototypes to adaptively assess the traversability of the current environment, effectively handling dynamic scene changes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate our approach against state-of-the-art benchmarks on both public datasets and our own dataset, covering diverse seasons and geographical locations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.638</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms recent approaches. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.779</span></span>Additionally, real-world vehicle experiments show that our method operates at 10 Hz, meeting real-time requirements, while a 5.5 km autonomous driving experiment further validates the generated traversability cost maps compatibility with downstream motion planning.</p>

To address this, we introduce HLS-Eval, the first complete benchmark and evaluation framework for LLM-driven HLS design.HLS-Eval targets two core tasks: (1) generating HLS code from natural language descriptions, and (2) performing HLS-specific code edits to optimize performance and hardware efficiency.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The benchmark includes 94 unique designs drawn from standard HLS benchmarks and novel sources. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.654</span></span>Each case is prepared via a semi-automated flow that produces a natural language description and a paired testbench for C-simulation and synthesis validation, ensuring each task is "LLM-ready."   Beyond the benchmark, HLS-Eval offers a modular Python framework for automated, parallel evaluation of both local and hosted LLMs.It includes a parallel evaluation engine, direct HLS tool integration, and abstractions for to support different LLM interaction paradigms, enabling rapid prototyping of new benchmarks, tasks, and LLM methods.   We demonstrate HLS-Eval through baseline evaluations of open-source LLMs on Vitis HLS, measuring outputs across four key metrics - parseability, compilability, runnability, and synthesizability - reflecting the iterative HLS design cycle.We also report pass@k metrics, establishing clear baselines and reusable infrastructure for the broader LLM-for-hardware community.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>All benchmarks, framework code, and results are open-sourced at https://github.com/stefanpie/hls-eval. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.727</span></span></p>

                  <p>White blood cell (WBC) classification assists in assessing immune health and diagnosing various diseases, yet manual classification is labor-intensive and prone to inconsistencies.Recent advancements in deep learning have shown promise over traditional methods; however, challenges such as data imbalance and the computational demands of modern technologies, such as Transformer-based models which do not scale well with input size, limit their practical application.This paper introduces a novel framework that leverages Mamba models integrated with ensemble learning to improve WBC classification.Mamba models, known for their linear complexity, provide a scalable alternative to Transformer-based approaches, making them suitable for deployment in resource-constrained environments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, we introduce a new WBC dataset, Chula-WBC-8, for benchmarking. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.608</span></span>Our approach not only validates the effectiveness of Mamba models in this domain but also demonstrates their potential to significantly enhance classification efficiency without compromising accuracy.The source code can be found at https://github.com/LewisClifton/Mamba-WBC-Classification.</p>

                  <p>MATLAB/Simulink is the leading tool for simulating complex Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs).The simulation models of complex CPSs are typically compute intensive, and the execution of test cases is long.Furthermore, the execution of test cases is typically triggered several times at different ``in-the-Loop'' test levels (i.e., Model, Software and Hardware-in-the-Loop).Therefore, test optimization techniques, such as test case prioritization, are paramount when testing these systems.In this paper, we present the largest empirical study on test case prioritization techniques for Simulink models by comparing the performance of white-box and black-box test case prioritization techniques.We assess traditional test case prioritization techniques, and we also propose new approaches for use in the context of Simulink models.We empirically compared 11 test case prioritization techniques using six Simulink models of different sizes and complexities.When comparing white-box against black-box test case prioritization techniques, we found that in general, white-box techniques were slightly better than black-box ones.In the context of white-box test case prioritization, the total greedy approach performed better than the additional greedy techniques in larger models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>As for the test case prioritization time, black-box techniques were faster, although total greedy techniques were fast enough to be used in practice. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.6</span></span></p>

                  <p>Microarchitectural attacks are a significant concern, leading to many hardware-based defense proposals.However, different defenses target different classes of attacks, and their impact on each other has not been fully considered.To raise awareness of this problem, we study an interaction between two state-of-the art defenses in this paper, timing obfuscations of remote cache lines (TORC) and delaying speculative changes to remote cache lines (DSRC).TORC mitigates cache-hit based attacks and DSRC mitigates speculative coherence state change attacks.   We observe that DSRC enables coherence information to be retrieved into the processor core, where it is out of the reach of timing obfuscations to protect.This creates an unforeseen consequence that redo operations can be triggered within the core to detect the presence or absence of remote cache lines, which constitutes a security vulnerability.We demonstrate that a new covert channel attack is possible using this vulnerability.We propose two ways to mitigate the attack, whose performance varies depending on an application's cache usage.One way is to never send remote exclusive coherence state (E) information to the core even if it is created.The other way is to never create a remote E state, which is responsible for triggering redos.   We demonstrate the timing difference caused by this microarchitectural defense assumption violation using GEM5 simulations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Performance evaluation on SPECrate 2017 and PARSEC benchmarks of the two fixes show less than 32\% average overhead across both sets of benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.712</span></span>The repair which prevented the creation of remote E state had less than 2.8% average overhead.</p>

                  <p>Autonomous fabrication systems are transforming construction and manufacturing, yet they remain vulnerable to print errors.Texture classification is a key component of computer vision systems that enable real-time monitoring and adjustment during cementitious fabrication.Traditional classification methods often rely on global image features, which can bias the model toward semantic content rather than low-level textures.In this paper, we introduce a novel preprocessing technique called "patch and shuffle," which segments input images into smaller patches, shuffles them, and reconstructs a jumbled image before classification.This transformation removes semantic context, forcing the classifier to rely on local texture features.   We evaluate this approach on a dataset of extruded cement images, using a ResNet-18-based architecture.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experiments compare the patch and shuffle method to a standard pipeline, holding all other factors constant. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.623</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Results show a significant improvement in accuracy: the patch and shuffle model achieved 90.64% test accuracy versus 72.46% for the baseline. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.713</span></span>These findings suggest that disrupting global structure enhances performance in texture-based classification tasks.

                  <p>Language models (LMs) are increasingly being integrated into a wide range of applications, yet the modern evaluation paradigm does not sufficiently reflect how they are actually being used.Current evaluations rely on benchmarks that often lack direct applicability to the real-world contexts in which LMs are being deployed.To address this gap, we propose Dimensional and Contextual Evaluation (DICE), an approach that evaluates LMs on granular, context-dependent dimensions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this position paper, we begin by examining the insufficiency of existing LM benchmarks, highlighting their limited applicability to real-world use cases. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span>Next, we propose a set of granular evaluation parameters that capture dimensions of LM behavior that are more meaningful to stakeholders across a variety of application domains.Specifically, we introduce the concept of context-agnostic parameters - such as robustness, coherence, and epistemic honesty - and context-specific parameters that must be tailored to the specific contextual constraints and demands of stakeholders choosing to deploy LMs into a particular setting.We then discuss potential approaches to operationalize this evaluation framework, finishing with the opportunities and challenges DICE presents to the LM evaluation landscape.Ultimately, this work serves as a practical and approachable starting point for context-specific and stakeholder-relevant evaluation of LMs.</p>

Given unique ranks, it is straightforward to select a designated leader.Thus, our protocol is a self-stabilizing leader election protocol as well.Ranking requires at least $n$ states per agent; hence, the goal is to minimize the additional number of states, called overhead states.The core of our protocol is a space-efficient but non-self-stabilizing ranking protocol that requires only $n + O(\log n)$ states.Our protocol stabilizes in $O(n^2\log n)$ interactions w.h.p.\ and in expectation, using $n + O(\log^2 n)$ states in total.Our stabilization time is asymptotically optimal (see Burman et al., PODC'21).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In comparison to the currently best known ranking protocol by Burman et al., which requires $n + \Omega(n)$ states, our result exponentially improves the number of overhead states. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span></p>

                  <p>Deep Material Network (DMN) has emerged as a powerful framework for multiscale material modeling, enabling efficient and accurate predictions of material behavior across different length scales.Unlike traditional machine learning approaches, the trainable parameters in DMN have direct physical interpretations, capturing the geometric characteristics of the microstructure rather than serving as purely statistical fitting parameters.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Its hierarchical tree structure effectively encodes microstructural interactions and deformation mechanisms, allowing DMN to achieve a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.608</span></span>This physics-informed architecture significantly reduces computational costs compared to direct numerical simulations while preserving essential microstructural physics.Furthermore, DMN can be trained solely on a linear elastic dataset while effectively extrapolating nonlinear responses during online prediction, making it a highly efficient and scalable approach for multiscale material modeling.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This article provides a comprehensive review of DMN, detailing its motivation, underlying methodology, and recent advancements. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.659</span></span>We discuss key modeling aspects, including its hierarchical structure, training process, and the role of physics-based constraints in enhancing predictive accuracy.Furthermore, we highlight its applications in component-scale multiscale analysis and inverse parameter identification, demonstrating its capability to bridge microscale material behavior with macroscale engineering predictions.Finally, we discuss challenges and future directions in improving DMN's generalization capabilities and its potential extensions for broader applications in multiscale modeling.</p>

                  <p>The Maven Central ecosystem forms the backbone of Java dependency management, hosting artifacts that vary significantly in their adoption, security, and ecosystem roles.Artifact reuse is fundamental in software development, with ecosystems like Maven Central facilitating this process.However, prior studies predominantly analyzed popular artifacts with numerous dependencies, leaving those without incoming dependencies (independent artifacts) unexplored.In this study, we analyzed 658,078 artifacts, of which 635,003 had at least one release.Among these, 93,101 artifacts (15.4%) were identified as independent (in-degree = 0), while the rest were classified as dependent.We looked at the impact of separate artifacts using PageRank and out-degree centrality and discovered that they were very important to the ecosystem.Further analysis across 18 different metrics revealed several advantages and comparability of independent artifacts with dependent artifacts: comparable popularity (25.58 vs. 7.30), fewer vulnerabilities (60 CVEs vs. 179 CVEs), and zero propagated vulnerabilities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Based on these results, it seems that independent artifacts make a big difference in the ecosystem and give developers a safe, self-contained alternative to traditional dependencies. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>These findings suggest that independent artifacts might be a beneficial choice for dependencies but have some maintainability issues.Therefore, developers should carefully incorporate independent artifacts into their projects, and artifact maintainers should prioritize this group of artifacts to mitigate the risk of transitive vulnerability propagation and improve software sustainability.</p>

                  <p>Knowledge distillation (KD) is a promising solution to compress large language models (LLMs) by transferring their knowledge to smaller models.During this process, white-box KD methods usually minimize the distance between the output distributions of the teacher model and the student model to transfer more information.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, we reveal that the current white-box KD framework exhibits two limitations: a) bridging probability distributions from different output spaces will limit the similarity between the teacher model and the student model; b) this framework cannot be applied to LLMs with different vocabularies. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.624</span></span>One of the root causes for these limitations is that the distributions from the teacher and the student for KD are output by different prediction heads, which yield distributions in different output spaces and dimensions.Therefore, in this paper, we propose a dual-space knowledge distillation (DSKD) framework that unifies the prediction heads of the teacher and the student models for KD.Specifically, we first introduce two projectors with ideal initialization to project the teacher/student hidden states into the student/teacher representation spaces.After this, the hidden states from different models can share the same head and unify the output spaces of the distributions.Furthermore, we develop an exact token alignment (ETA) algorithm to align the same tokens in two differently-tokenized sequences.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Based on the above, our DSKD framework is a general KD framework that supports both off-policy and on-policy KD, and KD between any two LLMs regardless of their vocabularies. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.655</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on instruction-following, mathematical reasoning, and code generation benchmarks show that DSKD significantly outperforms existing methods based on the current white-box KD framework and surpasses other cross-tokenizer KD methods for LLMs with different vocabularies. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.649</span></span></p>

                  <p>Masculine defaults are widely recognized as a significant type of gender bias, but they are often unseen as they are under-researched.Masculine defaults involve three key parts: (i) the cultural context, (ii) the masculine characteristics or behaviors, and (iii) the reward for, or simply acceptance of, those masculine characteristics or behaviors.In this work, we study discourse-based masculine defaults, and propose a twofold framework for (i) the large-scale discovery and analysis of gendered discourse words in spoken content via our Gendered Discourse Correlation Framework (GDCF); and (ii) the measurement of the gender bias associated with these gendered discourse words in LLMs via our Discourse Word-Embedding Association Test (D-WEAT).We focus our study on podcasts, a popular and growing form of social media, analyzing 15,117 podcast episodes.We analyze correlations between gender and discourse words -- discovered via LDA and BERTopic -- to automatically form gendered discourse word lists.We then study the prevalence of these gendered discourse words in domain-specific contexts, and find that gendered discourse-based masculine defaults exist in the domains of business, technology/politics, and video games.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Next, we study the representation of these gendered discourse words from a state-of-the-art LLM embedding model from OpenAI, and find that the masculine discourse words have a more stable and robust representation than the feminine discourse words, which may result in better system performance on downstream tasks for men. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span>Hence, men are rewarded for their discourse patterns with better system performance by one of the state-of-the-art language models -- and this embedding disparity is a representational harm and a masculine default.</p>

                  <p>Modern code generation has made significant strides in functional correctness and execution efficiency.However, these systems often overlook a critical dimension in real-world software development: maintainability.To handle dynamic requirements with minimal rework, we propose MaintainCoder as a pioneering solution.It integrates Waterfall model, design patterns, and multi-agent collaboration to systematically enhance cohesion, reduce coupling, and improve adaptability.We also introduce MaintainBench, a benchmark comprising requirement changes and corresponding dynamic metrics on maintainance effort.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments demonstrate that existing code generation methods struggle to meet maintainability standards when requirements evolve. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.622</span></span>In contrast, MaintainCoder improves maintainability metrics by 14-30% with even higher correctness, i.e. pass@k.Our work not only provides the foundation of maintainable code generation, but also highlights the need for more holistic code quality research.Resources: https://github.com/IAAR-Shanghai/MaintainCoder.</p>

                Enhancing Repository-Level Software Repair via Repository-Aware Knowledge Graphs
