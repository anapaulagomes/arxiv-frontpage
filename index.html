                  <p>In this paper, we propose spatio-temporal omni-object video grounding, dubbed OmniSTVG, a new STVG task that aims at localizing spatially and temporally all targets mentioned in the textual query from videos.Compared to classic STVG locating only a single target, OmniSTVG enables localization of not only an arbitrary number of text-referred targets but also their interacting counterparts in the query from the video, making it more flexible and practical in real scenarios for comprehensive understanding.In order to facilitate exploration of OmniSTVG, we introduce BOSTVG, a large-scale benchmark dedicated to OmniSTVG.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, our BOSTVG consists of 10,018 videos with 10.2M frames and covers a wide selection of 287 classes from diverse scenarios. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.737</span></span>Each sequence in BOSTVG, paired with a free-form textual query, encompasses a varying number of targets ranging from 1 to 10.To ensure high quality, each video is manually annotated with meticulous inspection and refinement.To our best knowledge, BOSTVG is to date the first and the largest benchmark for OmniSTVG.To encourage future research, we introduce a simple yet effective approach, named OmniTube, which, drawing inspiration from Transformer-based STVG methods, is specially designed for OmniSTVG and demonstrates promising results.By releasing BOSTVG, we hope to go beyond classic STVG by locating every object appearing in the query for more comprehensive understanding, opening up a new direction for STVG.Our benchmark, model, and results will be released at https://github.com/JellyYao3000/OmniSTVG.</p>

                  <p>3D Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently made substantial advancements.However, their potential remains untapped, primarily due to the limited quantity and suboptimal quality of 3D datasets.Current approaches attempt to transfer knowledge from 2D MLLMs to expand 3D instruction data, but still face modality and domain gaps.To this end, we introduce PiSA-Engine (Point-Self-Augmented-Engine), a new framework for generating instruction point-language datasets enriched with 3D spatial semantics.We observe that existing 3D MLLMs offer a comprehensive understanding of point clouds for annotation, while 2D MLLMs excel at cross-validation by providing complementary information.By integrating holistic 2D and 3D insights from off-the-shelf MLLMs, PiSA-Engine enables a continuous cycle of high-quality data generation.We select PointLLM as the baseline and adopt this co-evolution training framework to develop an enhanced 3D MLLM, termed PointLLM-PiSA.Additionally, we identify limitations in previous 3D benchmarks, which often feature coarse language captions and insufficient category diversity, resulting in inaccurate evaluations.To address this gap, we further introduce PiSA-Bench, a comprehensive 3D benchmark covering six key aspects with detailed and diverse labels.Experimental results demonstrate PointLLM-PiSA's state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot 3D object captioning and generative classification on our PiSA-Bench, achieving significant improvements of 46.45% (+8.33%) and 63.75% (+16.25%), respectively.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We will release the code, datasets, and benchmark. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.755</span></span></p>

                  <p>Multimodal Audio-Language Models (ALMs) can understand and reason over both audio and text.Typically, reasoning performance correlates with model size, with the best results achieved by models exceeding 8 billion parameters.However, no prior work has explored enabling small audio-language models to perform reasoning tasks, despite the potential applications for edge devices.To address this gap, we introduce Mellow, a small Audio-Language Model specifically designed for reasoning.Mellow achieves state-of-the-art performance among existing small audio-language models and surpasses several larger models in reasoning capabilities.For instance, Mellow scores 52.11 on MMAU, comparable to SoTA Qwen2Audio (which scores 52.5) while using 50 times fewer parameters and being trained on 60 times less data (audio hrs).To train Mellow, we introduce ReasonAQA, a dataset designed to enhance audio-grounded reasoning in models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It consists of a mixture of existing datasets (30% of the data) and synthetically generated data (70%). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.802</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The synthetic dataset is derived from audio captioning datasets, where Large Language Models (LLMs) generate detailed and multiple-choice questions focusing on audio events, objects, acoustic scenes, signal properties, semantics, and listener emotions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.776</span></span>To evaluate Mellow's reasoning ability, we benchmark it on a diverse set of tasks, assessing on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data, including audio understanding, deductive reasoning, and comparative reasoning.Finally, we conduct extensive ablation studies to explore the impact of projection layer choices, synthetic data generation methods, and language model pretraining on reasoning performance.Our training dataset, findings, and baseline pave the way for developing small ALMs capable of reasoning.</p>

                  <p>Although large visual-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in multimodal tasks, errors may occasionally arise due to biases during the reasoning process.Recently, reward models (RMs) have become increasingly pivotal in the reasoning process.Specifically, process RMs evaluate each reasoning step, outcome RMs focus on the assessment of reasoning results, and critique RMs perform error analysis on the entire reasoning process, followed by corrections.However, existing benchmarks for vision-language RMs (VLRMs) typically assess only a single aspect of their capabilities (e.g., distinguishing between two answers), thus limiting the all-round evaluation and restricting the development of RMs in the visual-language domain.To address this gap, we propose a comprehensive and challenging benchmark, dubbed as VLRMBench, encompassing 12,634 questions.VLRMBench is constructed based on three distinct types of datasets, covering mathematical reasoning, hallucination understanding, and multi-image understanding.We design 12 tasks across three major categories, focusing on evaluating VLRMs in the aspects of process understanding, outcome judgment, and critique generation.Extensive experiments are conducted on 21 open-source models and 5 advanced closed-source models, highlighting the challenges posed by VLRMBench.For instance, in the `Forecasting Future', a binary classification task, the advanced GPT-4o achieves only a 76.0% accuracy.Additionally, we perform comprehensive analytical studies, offering valuable insights for the future development of VLRMs.We anticipate that VLRMBench will serve as a pivotal benchmark in advancing VLRMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code and datasets will be available at https://github.com/JCruan519/VLRMBench. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.852</span></span></p>

                  <p>Robust and accurate proprioceptive state estimation of the main body is crucial for legged robots to execute tasks in extreme environments where exteroceptive sensors, such as LiDARs and cameras may become unreliable.In this paper, we propose DogLegs, a state estimation system for legged robots that fuses the measurements from a body-mounted inertial measurement unit (Body-IMU), joint encoders, and multiple leg-mounted IMUs (Leg-IMU) using an extended Kalman filter (EKF).The filter system contains the error states of all IMU frames.The Leg-IMUs are used to detect foot contact, thereby providing zero velocity measurements to update the state of the Leg-IMU frames.Additionally, we compute the relative position constraints between the Body-IMU and Leg-IMUs by the leg kinematics and use them to update the main body state and reduce the error drift of the individual IMU frames.Field experimental results have shown that our proposed system can achieve better state estimation accuracy compared to the traditional leg odometry method (using only Body-IMU and joint encoders) across different terrains.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We make our datasets publicly available to benefit the research community. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.746</span></span></p>

                  <p>Remote Sensing Image Captioning (RSIC) is a cross-modal field bridging vision and language, aimed at automatically generating natural language descriptions of features and scenes in remote sensing imagery.Despite significant advances in developing sophisticated methods and large-scale datasets for training vision-language models (VLMs), two critical challenges persist: the scarcity of non-English descriptive datasets and the lack of multilingual capability evaluation for models.These limitations fundamentally impede the progress and practical deployment of RSIC, particularly in the era of large VLMs.To address these challenges, this paper presents several significant contributions to the field.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>First, we introduce and analyze BRSIC (Bilingual Remote Sensing Image Captioning), a comprehensive bilingual dataset that enriches three established English RSIC datasets with Chinese descriptions, encompassing 13,634 images paired with 68,170 bilingual captions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.852</span></span>Building upon this foundation, we develop a systematic evaluation framework that addresses the prevalent inconsistency in evaluation protocols, enabling rigorous assessment of model performance through standardized retraining procedures on BRSIC.Furthermore, we present an extensive empirical study of eight state-of-the-art large vision-language models (LVLMs), examining their capabilities across multiple paradigms including zero-shot inference, supervised fine-tuning, and multi-lingual training.This comprehensive evaluation provides crucial insights into the strengths and limitations of current LVLMs in handling multilingual remote sensing tasks.Additionally, our cross-dataset transfer experiments reveal interesting findings.The code and data will be available at https://github.com/mrazhou/BRSIC.</p>

PE-RL not only improves on overall NPOV quality compared to the strongest baseline ($97.06\%\rightarrow 99.08\%$), but also scores much higher on features linguists identify as key to separating good answers from the best answers ($60.25\%\rightarrow 85.21\%$ for presence of supportive details, $68.74\%\rightarrow 91.43\%$ for absence of oversimplification).A qualitative analysis corroborates this.Finally, our evaluation finds no statistical differences between results on topics that appear in the training dataset and those on separated evaluation topics, which provides strong evidence that our approach to training PE-RL exhibits very effective out of topic generalization.</p>

                  <p>The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model has succeeded in deep learning (DL).However, its complex architecture and advantages over dense models in image classification remain unclear.In previous studies, MoE performance has often been affected by noise and outliers in the input space.Some approaches incorporate input clustering for training MoE models, but most clustering algorithms lack access to labeled data, limiting their effectiveness.This paper introduces the Double-stage Feature-level Clustering and Pseudo-labeling-based Mixture of Experts (DFCP-MoE) framework, which consists of input feature extraction, feature-level clustering, and a computationally efficient pseudo-labeling strategy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This approach reduces the impact of noise and outliers while leveraging a small subset of labeled data to label a large portion of unlabeled inputs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.619</span></span>We propose a conditional end-to-end joint training method that improves expert specialization by training the MoE model on well-labeled, clustered inputs.Unlike traditional MoE and dense models, the DFCP-MoE framework effectively captures input space diversity, leading to competitive inference results.We validate our approach on three benchmark datasets for multi-class classification tasks.</p>

In this paper, we show how graph-based intermediate representations help moving such scheduling work out of the critical path.In the context of SYCL programs distributed onto accelerator clusters, we introduce the instruction graph, a low-level representation that preserves full concurrency between memory management, data transfers, MPI peer-to-peer communication and kernel invocation.   Through integration within the Celerity runtime, we demonstrate how instruction-graph scheduling enables a system architecture that performs this analysis concurrently with execution.Using a scheduler lookahead mechanism, we further detect changing access patterns to optimize memory allocation in the presence of virtualized buffers.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We show the effectiveness of our method through strong-scaling benchmarks with multiple Celerity applications on up to 128 GPUs in a production cluster. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.641</span></span></p>

                  <p>Minibatch optimal transport coupling straightens paths in unconditional flow matching.This leads to computationally less demanding inference as fewer integration steps and less complex numerical solvers can be employed when numerically solving an ordinary differential equation at test time.However, in the conditional setting, minibatch optimal transport falls short.This is because the default optimal transport mapping disregards conditions, resulting in a conditionally skewed prior distribution during training.In contrast, at test time, we have no access to the skewed prior, and instead sample from the full, unbiased prior distribution.This gap between training and testing leads to a subpar performance.To bridge this gap, we propose conditional optimal transport C^2OT that adds a conditional weighting term in the cost matrix when computing the optimal transport assignment.Experiments demonstrate that this simple fix works with both discrete and continuous conditions in 8gaussians-to-moons, CIFAR-10, ImageNet-32x32, and ImageNet-256x256.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our method performs better overall compared to the existing baselines across different function evaluation budgets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.789</span></span>Code is available at https://hkchengrex.github.io/C2OT</p>

To address this challenge, we propose an auxiliary-LP-based framework capable of effectively approximating the best possible competitiveness achievable when applying the randomized primal-dual method to different function spaces.Specifically, we examine the framework introduced by Huang and Zhang (STOC 2020), which analyzes Stochastic Balance for vertex-weighted online matching with stochastic rewards.Our approach yields both lower and upper bounds on the best possible competitiveness attainable using the randomized primal-dual method for different choices of ${F}$. Notably, we establish that Stochastic Balance achieves a competitiveness of at least $0.5796$ for the problem (under equal vanishing probabilities), improving upon the previous bound of $0.576$ by Huang and Zhang (STOC 2020).Meanwhile, our analysis yields an upper bound of $0.5810$ for a function space strictly larger than that considered in Huang and Zhang (STOC 2020).</p>

We propose "DISTINGUISH": a real-time, AI-driven workflow designed to transform geosteering by integrating Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for geological parameterization, ensemble methods for model updating, and global discrete dynamic programming (DDP) optimization for complex decision-making during directional drilling operations.The DISTINGUISH framework relies on offline training of a GAN model to reproduce relevant geology realizations and a Forward Neural Network (FNN) to model Logging-While-Drilling (LWD) tools' response for a given geomodel.

                  <p>Multimodal Audio-Language Models (ALMs) can understand and reason over both audio and text.Typically, reasoning performance correlates with model size, with the best results achieved by models exceeding 8 billion parameters.However, no prior work has explored enabling small audio-language models to perform reasoning tasks, despite the potential applications for edge devices.To address this gap, we introduce Mellow, a small Audio-Language Model specifically designed for reasoning.Mellow achieves state-of-the-art performance among existing small audio-language models and surpasses several larger models in reasoning capabilities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For instance, Mellow scores 52.11 on MMAU, comparable to SoTA Qwen2 <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.63</span></span>Audio (which scores 52.5) while using 50 times fewer parameters and being trained on 60 times less data (audio hrs).To train Mellow, we introduce ReasonAQA, a dataset designed to enhance audio-grounded reasoning in models.It consists of a mixture of existing datasets (30% of the data) and synthetically generated data (70%).The synthetic dataset is derived from audio captioning datasets, where Large Language Models (LLMs) generate detailed and multiple-choice questions focusing on audio events, objects, acoustic scenes, signal properties, semantics, and listener emotions.To evaluate Mellow's reasoning ability, we benchmark it on a diverse set of tasks, assessing on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data, including audio understanding, deductive reasoning, and comparative reasoning.Finally, we conduct extensive ablation studies to explore the impact of projection layer choices, synthetic data generation methods, and language model pretraining on reasoning performance.Our training dataset, findings, and baseline pave the way for developing small ALMs capable of reasoning.</p>

                  <p>In many practical scenarios of black box optimization, the objective function is subject to constraints that must be satisfied to avoid undesirable outcomes.Such constraints are typically unknown and must be learned during optimization.Safe Bayesian optimization aims to find the global optimum while ensuring that the constraints are satisfied with high probability.However, it is often sample-inefficient due to the small initial feasible set, which requires expansion by evaluating the objective or constraint functions, limiting its applicability to low-dimensional or inexpensive problems.To enhance sample efficiency, additional information from cheap simulations can be leveraged, albeit at the cost of safeness guarantees.This paper introduces a novel safe multi-task Bayesian optimization algorithm that integrates multiple tasks while maintaining high-probability safety.We derive robust uniform error bounds for the multi-task case and demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach on benchmark functions and a control problem.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results show a significant improvement in sample efficiency, making the proposed method well-suited for expensive-to-evaluate functions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.735</span></span></p>

                  <p>Bag-based Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) approaches have emerged as the mainstream methodology for Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification.However, most existing methods adopt a segmented training strategy, which first extracts features using a pre-trained feature extractor and then aggregates these features through MIL.This segmented training approach leads to insufficient collaborative optimization between the feature extraction network and the MIL network, preventing end-to-end joint optimization and thereby limiting the overall performance of the model.Additionally, conventional methods typically extract features from all patches of fixed size, ignoring the multi-scale observation characteristics of pathologists.This not only results in significant computational resource waste when tumor regions represent a minimal proportion (as in the Camelyon16 dataset) but may also lead the model to suboptimal solutions.   To address these limitations, this paper proposes an end-to-end multi-scale WSI classification framework that integrates multi-scale feature extraction with multiple instance learning.Specifically, our approach includes: (1) a semantic feature filtering module to reduce interference from non-lesion areas; (2) a multi-scale feature extraction module to capture pathological information at different levels; and (3) a multi-scale fusion MIL module for global modeling and feature integration.Through an end-to-end training strategy, we simultaneously optimize both the feature extractor and MIL network, ensuring maximum compatibility between them.   Experiments were conducted on three cross-center datasets (DigestPath2019, BCNB, and UBC-OCEAN).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both accuracy (ACC) and AUC metrics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.728</span></span></p>

                  <p>Data heterogeneity is one of the major challenges in federated learning (FL), which results in substantial client variance and slow convergence.In this study, we propose a novel solution: decomposing a convolutional filter in FL into a linear combination of filter subspace elements, i.e., filter atoms.This simple technique transforms global filter aggregation in FL into aggregating filter atoms and their atom coefficients.The key advantage here involves mathematically generating numerous cross-terms by expanding the product of two weighted sums from filter atom and atom coefficient.These cross-terms effectively emulate many additional latent clients, significantly reducing model variance, which is validated by our theoretical analysis and empirical observation.Furthermore, our method permits different training schemes for filter atoms and atom coefficients for highly adaptive model personalization and communication efficiency.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Empirical results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our filter decomposition technique substantially improves the accuracy of FL methods, confirming its efficacy in addressing data heterogeneity. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.608</span></span></p>

                The Shift from Writing to Pruning Software: A Bonsai-Inspired IDE for Reshaping AI Generated Code

                  <p>The rise of AI-driven coding assistants signals a fundamental shift in how software is built.While AI coding assistants have been integrated into existing Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), their full potential remains largely untapped.A key challenge is that these AI assistants can suffer from hallucinations, leading developers down decision paths that the AI should not dictate, sometimes even without the users awareness or consent.Moreover, current static-file IDEs lack the mechanisms to address critical issues such as tracking the provenance of AI-generated code and integrating version control in a way that aligns with the dynamic nature of AI-assisted development.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>As a result, developers are left without the necessary tools to manage, refine, and validate AI generated code systematically, making it difficult to ensure correctness, maintainability, and trust in the development process. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.654</span></span>Existing IDEs treat AI-generated code as static text, offering limited support for managing its evolution, refinement, or multiple alternative paths.   Drawing inspiration from the ancient art of Japanese Bonsai gardening focused on balance, structure, and deliberate pruning: we propose a new approach to IDEs, where AI is allowed to generate in its true, unconstrained form, free from traditional file structures.This approach fosters a more fluid and interactive method for code evolution.We introduce the concept of a Bonsai-inspired IDE, structured as a graph of generated code snippets and multiple code paths, enabling developers to reshape AI generated code to suit their needs.Our vision calls for a shift away from a static file based model toward a dynamic, evolving system that allows for continuous refinement of generated code, with the IDE evolving alongside AI powered modifications rather than merely serving as a place to write and edit code.</p>
