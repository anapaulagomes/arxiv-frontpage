                  <p>Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is crucial for automotive design, requiring the analysis of large 3D point clouds to study how vehicle geometry affects pressure fields and drag forces.However, existing deep learning approaches for CFD struggle with the computational complexity of processing high-resolution 3D data.We propose Factorized Implicit Global Convolution (FIGConv), a novel architecture that efficiently solves CFD problems for very large 3D meshes with arbitrary input and output geometries.FIGConv achieves quadratic complexity $O(N^2)$, a significant improvement over existing 3D neural CFD models that require cubic complexity $O(N^3)$. Our approach combines Factorized Implicit Grids to approximate high-resolution domains, efficient global convolutions through 2D reparameterization, and a U-shaped architecture for effective information gathering and integration.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We validate our approach on the industry-standard Ahmed body dataset and the large-scale DrivAerNet dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.767</span></span>In DrivAerNet, our model achieves an $R^2$ value of 0.95 for drag prediction, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art by a significant margin.This represents a 40% improvement in relative mean squared error and a 70% improvement in absolute mean squared error over previous methods.</p>

                  <p>Understanding everyday life behavior of young adults through personal devices, e.g., smartphones and smartwatches, is key for various applications, from enhancing the user experience in mobile apps to enabling appropriate interventions in digital health apps.Towards this goal, previous studies have relied on datasets combining passive sensor data with human-provided annotations or self-reports.However, many existing datasets are limited in scope, often focusing on specific countries primarily in the Global North, involving a small number of participants, or using a limited range of pre-processed sensors.These limitations restrict the ability to capture cross-country variations of human behavior, including the possibility of studying model generalization, and robustness.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this gap, we introduce DiversityOne, a dataset which spans eight countries (China, Denmark, India, Italy, Mexico, Mongolia, Paraguay, and the United Kingdom) and includes data from 782 college students over four weeks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.794</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>DiversityOne contains data from 26 smartphone sensor modalities and 350K+ self-reports. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.742</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>As of today, it is one of the largest and most diverse publicly available datasets, while featuring extensive demographic and psychosocial survey data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.737</span></span>DiversityOne opens the possibility of studying important research problems in ubiquitous computing, particularly in domain adaptation and generalization across countries, all research areas so far largely underexplored because of the lack of adequate datasets.</p>

                  <p>In code review, generating structured and relevant comments is crucial for identifying code issues and facilitating accurate code changes that ensure an efficient code review process.Well-crafted comments not only streamline the code review itself but are also essential for subsequent tasks like code refinement, where the code is modified to satisfy the input review comment.Although various AI-based approaches aimed to automate comment generation, their effectiveness remains limited by the quality of the training data.Existing code review datasets are often noisy and unrefined, posing limitations to the learning potential of AI models and hindering the automation process.   To address these challenges, we propose a curation pipeline designed to enhance the quality of the largest publicly available code review dataset.We begin by establishing an evaluation framework, incorporating specific criteria and categories to empirically study the initial quality of the dataset.Using a large language model (LLM)-driven approach, we then apply our curation pipeline to refine the dataset.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A comparative analysis of the newly curated dataset, based on the same evaluation framework, demonstrates substantial improvements in the clarity and conciseness of the comments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.819</span></span>Additionally, we assess the impact of the curated dataset on automating downstream tasks, specifically comment generation and code refinement.Our findings show that the curated dataset leads to enhanced model performance in generating more accurate comments.Curated comments are also more useful as they lead to more accurate code refinement.</p>

                  <p>Language agents have become a promising solution to complex interactive tasks.One of the key ingredients to the success of language agents is the reward model on the trajectory of the agentic workflow, which provides valuable guidance during training or inference.However, due to the lack of annotations of intermediate interactions, most existing works use an outcome reward model to optimize policies across entire trajectories.This may lead to sub-optimal policies and hinder the overall performance.To address this, we propose QLASS (Q-guided Language Agent Stepwise Search), to automatically generate annotations by estimating Q-values in a stepwise manner for open language agents.By introducing a reasoning tree and performing process reward modeling, QLASS provides effective intermediate guidance for each step.With the stepwise guidance, we propose a Q-guided generation strategy to enable language agents to better adapt to long-term value, resulting in significant performance improvement during model inference on complex interactive agent tasks.Notably, even with almost half the annotated data, QLASS retains strong performance, demonstrating its efficiency in handling limited supervision.We also empirically demonstrate that QLASS can lead to more effective decision making through qualitative analysis.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We will release our code and data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.87</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks.However, their deployment in safety-critical domains poses significant challenges.Existing safety fine-tuning methods, which focus on textual or multimodal content, fall short in addressing challenging cases or disrupt the balance between helpfulness and harmlessness.Our evaluation highlights a safety reasoning gap: these methods lack safety visual reasoning ability, leading to such bottlenecks.To address this limitation and enhance both visual perception and reasoning in safety-critical contexts, we propose a novel dataset that integrates multi-image inputs with safety Chain-of-Thought (CoT) labels as fine-grained reasoning logic to improve model performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, we introduce the Multi-Image Safety (MIS) dataset, an instruction-following dataset tailored for multi-image safety scenarios, consisting of training and test splits. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.806</span></span>Our experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning InternVL2.5-8B with MIS significantly outperforms both powerful open-source models and API-based models in challenging multi-image tasks requiring safety-related visual reasoning.This approach not only delivers exceptional safety performance but also preserves general capabilities without any trade-offs.Specifically, fine-tuning with MIS increases average accuracy by 0.83% across five general benchmarks and reduces the Attack Success Rate (ASR) on multiple safety benchmarks by a large margin.Data and Models are released under: \href{https://dripnowhy.github.io/MIS/}{\texttt{https://dripnowhy.github.io/MIS/}}</p>

                  <p>Real-world open-domain questions can be complicated, particularly when answering them involves information from multiple information sources.LLMs have demonstrated impressive performance in decomposing complex tasks into simpler steps, and previous work has used it for better retrieval in support of complex questions.However, LLM's decomposition of questions is unaware of what data is available and how data is organized, often leading to a sub-optimal retrieval performance.Recent effort in agentic RAG proposes to perform retrieval in an iterative fashion, where a followup query is derived as an action based on previous rounds of retrieval.While this provides one way of interacting with the data collection, agentic RAG's exploration of data is inefficient because successive queries depend on previous results rather than being guided by the organization of available data in the collection.To address this problem, we propose an LLM-based retrieval method -- ARM, that aims to better align the question with the organization of the data collection by exploring relationships among data objects beyond matching the utterance of the query, thus leading to a retrieve-all-at-once solution for complex queries.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluated ARM on two datasets, Bird and OTT-QA. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.727</span></span>On Bird, it outperforms standard RAG with query decomposition by up to 5.2 pt in execution accuracy and agentic RAG (ReAct) by up to 15.9 pt.On OTT-QA, it achieves up to 5.5 pt and 19.3 pt higher F1 match scores compared to these approaches.</p>

                  <p>Learning effective deep portrait matting models requires training data of both high quality and large quantity.Neither quality nor quantity can be easily met for portrait matting, however.Since the most accurate ground-truth portrait mattes are acquired in front of the green screen, it is almost impossible to harvest a large-scale portrait matting dataset in reality.This work shows that one can leverage text prompts and the recent Layer Diffusion model to generate high-quality portrait foregrounds and extract latent portrait mattes.However, the portrait mattes cannot be readily in use due to significant generation artifacts.Inspired by the connectivity priors observed in portrait images, that is, the border of portrait foregrounds always appears connected, a connectivity-aware approach is introduced to refine portrait mattes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Building on this, a large-scale portrait matting dataset is created, termed LD-Portrait-20K, with $20,051$ portrait foregrounds and high-quality alpha mattes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.926</span></span>Extensive experiments demonstrated the value of the LD-Portrait-20K dataset, with models trained on it significantly outperforming those trained on other datasets.In addition, comparisons with the chroma keying algorithm and an ablation study on dataset capacity further confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed matte creation approach.Further, the dataset also contributes to state-of-the-art video portrait matting, implemented by simple video segmentation and a trimap-based image matting model trained on this dataset.</p>

                  <p>Fixing Python dependency issues is a tedious and error-prone task for developers, who must manually identify and resolve environment dependencies and version constraints of third-party modules and Python interpreters.Researchers have attempted to automate this process by relying on large knowledge graphs and database lookup tables.However, these traditional approaches face limitations due to the variety of dependency error types, large sets of possible module versions, and conflicts among transitive dependencies.This study explores the potential of using large language models (LLMs) to automatically fix dependency issues in Python programs.We introduce PLLM (pronounced "plum"), a novel technique that employs retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to help an LLM infer Python versions and required modules for a given Python file.PLLM builds a testing environment that iteratively (1) prompts the LLM for module combinations, (2) tests the suggested changes, and (3) provides feedback (error messages) to the LLM to refine the fix.This feedback cycle leverages natural language processing (NLP) to intelligently parse and interpret build error messages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We benchmark PLLM on the Gistable HG2.9K dataset, a collection of challenging single-file Python gists. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.781</span></span>We compare PLLM against two state-of-the-art automatic dependency inference approaches, namely PyEGo and ReadPyE, w.r.t.the ability to resolve dependency issues.Our results indicate that PLLM can fix more dependency issues than the two baselines, with +218 (+15.97%) more fixes over ReadPyE and +281 (+21.58%) over PyEGo.Our deeper analyses suggest that PLLM is particularly beneficial for projects with many dependencies and for specific third-party numerical and machine-learning modules.Our findings demonstrate the potential of LLM-based approaches to iteratively resolve Python dependency issues.</p>

                  <p>Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification aims at categorizing each pixel in an HSI into a specific land cover class, which is crucial for applications like remote sensing, environmental monitoring, and agriculture.Although deep learning-based HSI classification methods have achieved significant advancements, existing methods still rely on manually labeled data for training, which is both time-consuming and labor-intensive.To address this limitation, we introduce a novel zero-shot hyperspectral image classification framework based on CLIP (SPECIAL), aiming to eliminate the need for manual annotations.The SPECIAL framework consists of two main stages: (1) CLIP-based pseudo-label generation, and (2) noisy label learning.In the first stage, HSI is spectrally interpolated to produce RGB bands.These bands are subsequently classified using CLIP, resulting in noisy pseudo-labels that are accompanied by confidence scores.To improve the quality of these labels, we propose a scaling strategy that fuses predictions from multiple spatial scales.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In the second stage, spectral information and a label refinement technique are incorporated to mitigate label noise and further enhance classification accuracy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.625</span></span>Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our SPECIAL outperforms existing methods in zero-shot HSI classification, showing its potential for more practical applications.The code is available at https://github.com/LiPang/SPECIAL.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) have shown remarkable performance in enhancing response accuracy and relevance by integrating external knowledge into generative models.However, existing RAG methods primarily focus on providing text-only answers, even in multimodal retrieval-augmented generation scenarios.In this work, we introduce the Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Multimodal Generation (MRAMG) task, which aims to generate answers that combine both text and images, fully leveraging the multimodal data within a corpus.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Despite the importance of this task, there is a notable absence of a comprehensive benchmark to effectively evaluate MRAMG performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.629</span></span>To bridge this gap, we introduce the MRAMG-Bench, a carefully curated, human-annotated dataset comprising 4,346 documents, 14,190 images, and 4,800 QA pairs, sourced from three categories: Web Data, Academic Papers, and Lifestyle.The dataset incorporates diverse difficulty levels and complex multi-image scenarios, providing a robust foundation for evaluating multimodal generation tasks.To facilitate rigorous evaluation, our MRAMG-Bench incorporates a comprehensive suite of both statistical and LLM-based metrics, enabling a thorough analysis of the performance of popular generative models in the MRAMG task.Besides, we propose an efficient multimodal answer generation framework that leverages both LLMs and MLLMs to generate multimodal responses.Our datasets are available at: https://huggingface.co/MRAMG.</p>

                  <p>Bug reports are essential for developers to confirm software problems, investigate their causes, and validate fixes.Unfortunately, reports often miss important information or are written unclearly, which can cause delays, increased issue resolution effort, or even the inability to solve issues.One of the most common components of reports that are problematic is the steps to reproduce the bug(s) (S2Rs), which are essential to replicate the described program failures and reason about fixes.Given the proclivity for deficiencies in reported S2Rs, prior work has proposed techniques that assist reporters in writing or assessing the quality of S2Rs.However, automated understanding of S2Rs is challenging, and requires linking nuanced natural language phrases with specific, semantically related program information.Prior techniques often struggle to form such language to program connections - due to issues in language variability and limitations of information gleaned from program analyses.   To more effectively tackle the problem of S2R quality annotation, we propose a new technique called AstroBR, which leverages the language understanding capabilities of LLMs to identify and extract the S2Rs from bug reports and map them to GUI interactions in a program state model derived via dynamic analysis.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We compared AstroBR to a related state-of-the-art approach and we found that AstroBR annotates S2Rs 25.2% better (in terms of F1 score) than the baseline. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.653</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, AstroBR suggests more accurate missing S2Rs than the baseline (by 71.4% in terms of F1 score). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.659</span></span></p>

Our approach combines Factorized Implicit Grids to approximate high-resolution domains, efficient global convolutions through 2D reparameterization, and a U-shaped architecture for effective information gathering and integration.We validate our approach on the industry-standard Ahmed body dataset and the large-scale DrivAerNet dataset.In DrivAerNet, our model achieves an $R^2$ value of 0.95 for drag prediction, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art by a significant margin.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This represents a 40% improvement in relative mean squared error and a 70% improvement in absolute mean squared error over previous methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.661</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at reasoning and planning when trained on chainof-thought (CoT) data, where the step-by-step thought process is explicitly outlined by text tokens.However, this results in lengthy inputs where many words support textual coherence rather than core reasoning information, and processing these inputs consumes substantial computation resources.In this work, we propose a hybrid representation of the reasoning process, where we partially abstract away the initial reasoning steps using latent discrete tokens generated by VQ-VAE, significantly reducing the length of reasoning traces.We explore the use of latent trace abstractions in two scenarios: 1) training the model from scratch for the Keys-Finding Maze problem, 2) fine-tuning LLMs on this hybrid data with an extended vocabulary including unseen latent tokens, for both logical and mathematical reasoning problems.To facilitate effective learning, we introduce a simple training procedure that randomly mixes latent and text tokens, which enables fast adaptation to new latent tokens.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our approach consistently outperforms the baselines methods in various benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.812</span></span></p>

                  <p>Software vulnerabilities are commonly detected via static analysis, penetration testing, and fuzzing.They can also be found by running unit tests - so-called vulnerability-witnessing tests - that stimulate the security-sensitive behavior with crafted inputs.Developing such tests is difficult and time-consuming; thus, automated data-driven approaches could help developers intercept vulnerabilities earlier.However, training and validating such approaches require a lot of data, which is currently scarce.This paper introduces VUTECO, a deep learning-based approach for collecting instances of vulnerability-witnessing tests from Java repositories.VUTECO carries out two tasks: (1) the "Finding" task to determine whether a test case is security-related, and (2) the "Matching" task to relate a test case to the exact vulnerability it is witnessing.VUTECO successfully addresses the Finding task, achieving perfect precision and 0.83 F0.5 score on validated test cases in VUL4J and returning 102 out of 145 (70%) correct security-related test cases from 244 open-source Java projects.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Despite showing sufficiently good performance for the Matching task - i.e., 0.86 precision and 0.68 F0.5 score - VUTECO failed to retrieve any valid match in the wild. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.608</span></span>Nevertheless, we observed that in almost all of the matches, the test case was still security-related despite being matched to the wrong vulnerability.In the end, VUTECO can help find vulnerability-witnessing tests, though the matching with the right vulnerability is yet to be solved; the findings obtained lay the stepping stone for future research on the matter.</p>

                  <p>A quantum processing unit (QPU) must contain a large number of high quality qubits to produce accurate results for problems at useful scales.In contrast, most scientific and industry classical computation workloads happen in parallel on distributed systems, which rely on copying data across multiple cores.Unfortunately, copying quantum data is theoretically prohibited due to the quantum non-cloning theory.Instead, quantum circuit cutting techniques cut a large quantum circuit into multiple smaller subcircuits, distribute the subcircuits on parallel QPUs and reconstruct the results with classical computing.Such techniques make distributed hybrid quantum computing (DHQC) a possibility but also introduce an exponential classical co-processing cost in the number of cuts and easily become intractable.This paper presents TensorQC, which leverages classical tensor networks to bring an exponential runtime advantage over state-of-the-art parallelization post-processing techniques.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>As a result, this paper demonstrates running benchmarks that are otherwise intractable for a standalone QPU and prior circuit cutting techniques. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.63</span></span>Specifically, this paper runs six realistic benchmarks using QPUs available nowadays and a single GPU, and reduces the QPU size and quality requirements by more than $10\times$ over purely quantum platforms.</p>

                  <p>At the edge, there is a high level of similarity in computing.One approach that has been proposed to enhance the efficiency of edge computing is computation reuse, which eliminates redundant computations.Edge computing is integrated with the ICN architecture, capitalizing on its inherent intelligence to facilitate computation reuse and reduce redundancies in computing operations.In many past works, ICN's ability to enable computation reuse through caching has been limited.In this context, a new approach is proposed that considers computation requests with similar input data, which yield identical results, as equivalent.This method facilitates computation reuse through caching in ICN.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The use of approximate results to reduce redundant computations without requiring high accuracy in input matching is provided. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.623</span></span>This concept is termed the Similarity Index, which effectively considers images to be similar despite minor changes in the angle of photography.The Similarity Index is determined through an algorithm known as HNSW and utilizes the SIFT descriptor to identify similar data.This approach helps reduce user latency times by providing quick access to results.The evaluation, simulated using the ndnSIM tool, showed an 86% improvement in completion time compared to scenarios without computation reuse, whereas previous works reported only a 70% improvement.To strengthen this method, an analytical model for computing request transfer considering computation reuse in ICN-based edge computing is provided.To assess the accuracy of the model, several evaluations have been conducted in the simulator by varying the parameters, resulting in a maximum error percentage of approximately 16%.</p>

                  <p>Under-Display Camera (UDC) houses a digital camera lens under a display panel.However, UDC introduces complex degradations such as noise, blur, decrease in transmittance, and flare.Despite the remarkable progress, previous research on UDC mainly focuses on eliminating diffraction in the spatial domain and rarely explores its potential in the frequency domain.It is essential to consider both the spatial and frequency domains effectively.For example, degradations, such as noise and blur, can be addressed by local information (e.g., CNN kernels in the spatial domain).At the same time, tackling flares may require leveraging global information (e.g., the frequency domain).In this paper, we revisit the UDC degradations in the Fourier space and figure out intrinsic frequency priors that imply the presence of the flares.Based on this observation, we propose a novel multi-level DNN architecture called SFIM.It efficiently restores UDC-distorted images by integrating local and global (the collective contribution of all points in the image) information.The architecture exploits CNNs to capture local information and FFT-based models to capture global information.SFIM comprises a spatial domain block (SDB), a Frequency Domain Block (FDB), and an Attention-based Multi-level Integration Block (AMIB).Specifically, SDB focuses more on detailed textures such as noise and blur, FDB emphasizes irregular texture loss in extensive areas such as flare, and AMIB enables effective cross-domain interaction.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>SFIM's superior performance over state-of-the-art approaches is demonstrated through rigorous quantitative and qualitative assessments across three UDC benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.633</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's o1 have demonstrated remarkable abilities in complex reasoning tasks by scaling test-time compute and exhibiting human-like deep thinking.However, we identify a phenomenon we term underthinking, where o1-like LLMs frequently switch between different reasoning thoughts without sufficiently exploring promising paths to reach a correct solution.This behavior leads to inadequate depth of reasoning and decreased performance, particularly on challenging mathematical problems.To systematically analyze this issue, we conduct experiments on three challenging test sets and two representative open-source o1-like models, revealing that frequent thought switching correlates with incorrect responses.We introduce a novel metric to quantify underthinking by measuring token efficiency in incorrect answers.To address underthinking, we propose a decoding strategy with thought switching penalty TIP that discourages premature transitions between thoughts, encouraging deeper exploration of each reasoning path.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results demonstrate that our approach improves accuracy across challenging datasets without requiring model fine-tuning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.607</span></span>Our findings contribute to understanding reasoning inefficiencies in o1-like LLMs and offer a practical solution to enhance their problem-solving capabilities.</p>

We first evaluate GRAPE with a controlled experiment, where we sample various solutions for each question in UltraInteract from multiple models and fine-tune commonly used LMs like LLaMA3.1-8B, Mistral-7B, and Qwen2.5-7B on GRAPE-selected data.GRAPE significantly outperforms strong baselines, including distilling from the strongest model with an absolute gain of up to 13.8%, averaged across benchmarks, and training on 3x more data with a maximum performance improvement of 17.3%.GRAPE's strong performance generalizes to realistic settings.We experiment with the post-training data used for Tulu3 and Olmo-2.GRAPE outperforms strong baselines trained on 4.5 times more data by 6.1% and a state-of-the-art data selection approach by 3% on average performance.Remarkably, using 1/3 of the data and half the number of epochs, GRAPE enables LLaMA3.1-8B to surpass the performance of Tulu3-SFT by 3.5%.</p>

                  <p>Recent advances in large language models, particularly following GPT-4o, have sparked increasing interest in developing omni-modal models capable of understanding more modalities.While some open-source alternatives have emerged, there is still a notable lag behind specialized single-modality models in performance.In this paper, we present Ola, an Omni-modal language model that achieves competitive performance across image, video, and audio understanding compared to specialized counterparts.The core design of Ola lies in its progressive modality alignment strategy that extends the supporting modality of the language model progressively.Our training pipeline begins with the most distinct modalities: image and text, then gradually expands the skill sets of the model using speech data that connects language and audio knowledge, and video data that connects all modalities.The progressive learning pipeline also enables us to maintain a relatively small size of the cross-modal alignment data, making developing omni-modal from existing vision-language models easy and less costly.Moreover, to unlock an advanced interactive experience like GPT-4o, we further design a sentence-wise decoding solution for streaming speech generation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments demonstrate that Ola surpasses existing open omni-modal LLMs across all modalities while achieving highly competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art specialized models of similar sizes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.66</span></span>We aim to make Ola a fully open omni-modal understanding solution to advance future research in this emerging field.Model weights, code, and data are open-sourced at https://github.com/Ola-Omni/Ola.</p>

In traffic scenarios, this impairment can even lead to safety concerns.In this paper, we introduce an LLM-simulated immersive projection environment designed to improve this ability in autistic children while ensuring their safety.We first propose 17 design considerations across four major categories, derived from a comprehensive review of previous research.Next, we developed a system called AIroad, which leverages LLMs to simulate drivers with varying social intents, expressed through explicit multimodal social signals.AIroad helps autistic children bridge the gap in recognizing the intentions behind behaviors and learning appropriate responses through various stimuli.A user study involving 14 participants demonstrated that this technology effectively engages autistic children and leads to significant improvements in their comprehension of social affordances in traffic scenarios.Additionally, parents reported high perceived usability of the system.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These findings highlight the potential of combining LLM technology with immersive environments for the functional rehabilitation of autistic children in the future. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.697</span></span></p>

To more effectively tackle the problem of S2R quality annotation, we propose a new technique called AstroBR, which leverages the language understanding capabilities of LLMs to identify and extract the S2Rs from bug reports and map them to GUI interactions in a program state model derived via dynamic analysis.We compared AstroBR to a related state-of-the-art approach and we found that AstroBR annotates S2Rs 25.2% better (in terms of F1 score) than the baseline.Additionally, AstroBR suggests more accurate missing S2Rs than the baseline (by 71.4% in terms of F1 score).</p>

To address these challenges, we propose a curation pipeline designed to enhance the quality of the largest publicly available code review dataset.We begin by establishing an evaluation framework, incorporating specific criteria and categories to empirically study the initial quality of the dataset.Using a large language model (LLM)-driven approach, we then apply our curation pipeline to refine the dataset.A comparative analysis of the newly curated dataset, based on the same evaluation framework, demonstrates substantial improvements in the clarity and conciseness of the comments.Additionally, we assess the impact of the curated dataset on automating downstream tasks, specifically comment generation and code refinement.Our findings show that the curated dataset leads to enhanced model performance in generating more accurate comments.Curated comments are also more useful as they lead to more accurate code refinement.</p>

                  <p><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper analyses how software developers elicit explainability requirements when creating a software application with an AI component, through a case study using AI in the medical context of predicting cerebral palsy (CP) risk in infants. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span>Following a small software development team at a Norwegian hospital, we observe their process of simultaneously developing the AI application and discovering what explanations clinicians require from the AI predictions.Since clinicians struggled to articulate their explainability needs before interacting with the system, an iterative approach proved effective: the team started with minimal explanations and refined these based on clinicians' responses during real patient examinations.Our preliminary findings from the first two iterations show that clinicians valued "interrogative explanations" - i.e., tools that let them explore and compare the AI predictions with their own assessments - over detailed technical explanations of the AI model's inner workings.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Based on our analysis, we suggest that successful explainability requirements emerge through iterative collaboration between developers and users rather than being fully specified upfront. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.664</span></span>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first empirical case study on eliciting explainability requirements in software engineering.</p>
