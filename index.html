                  <p>Developing clinically useful cell-level analysis tools in digital pathology remains challenging due to limitations in dataset granularity, inconsistent annotations, high computational demands, and difficulties integrating new technologies into workflows.To address these issues, we propose a solution that enhances data quality, model performance, and usability by creating a lightweight, extensible cell segmentation and classification model.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>First, we update data labels through cross-relabeling to refine annotations of PanNuke and MoNuSAC, producing a unified dataset with seven distinct cell types. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.794</span></span>Second, we leverage the H-Optimus foundation model as a fixed encoder to improve feature representation for simultaneous segmentation and classification tasks.Third, to address foundation models' computational demands, we distill knowledge to reduce model size and complexity while maintaining comparable performance.Finally, we integrate the distilled model into QuPath, a widely used open-source digital pathology platform.Results demonstrate improved segmentation and classification performance using the H-Optimus-based model compared to a CNN-based model.Specifically, average $R^2$ improved from 0.575 to 0.871, and average $PQ$ score improved from 0.450 to 0.492, indicating better alignment with actual cell counts and enhanced segmentation quality.The distilled model maintains comparable performance while reducing parameter count by a factor of 48.By reducing computational complexity and integrating into workflows, this approach may significantly impact diagnostics, reduce pathologist workload, and improve outcomes.Although the method shows promise, extensive validation is necessary prior to clinical deployment.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs), particularly those with reasoning capabilities, have rapidly advanced in recent years, demonstrating significant potential across a wide range of applications.However, their deployment in healthcare, especially in disease reasoning tasks, is hindered by the challenge of acquiring expert-level cognitive data.In this paper, we introduce Citrus, a medical language model that bridges the gap between clinical expertise and AI reasoning by emulating the cognitive processes of medical experts.The model is trained on a large corpus of simulated expert disease reasoning data, synthesized using a novel approach that accurately captures the decision-making pathways of clinicians.This approach enables Citrus to better simulate the complex reasoning processes involved in diagnosing and treating medical conditions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To further address the lack of publicly available datasets for medical reasoning tasks, we release the last-stage training data, including a custom-built medical diagnostic dialogue dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.847</span></span>This open-source contribution aims to support further research and development in the field.Evaluations using authoritative benchmarks such as MedQA, covering tasks in medical reasoning and language understanding, show that Citrus achieves superior performance compared to other models of similar size.These results highlight Citrus potential to significantly enhance medical decision support systems, providing a more accurate and efficient tool for clinical decision-making.</p>

                  <p>Research on egocentric tasks in computer vision has mostly focused on head-mounted cameras, such as fisheye cameras or embedded cameras inside immersive headsets.We argue that the increasing miniaturization of optical sensors will lead to the prolific integration of cameras into many more body-worn devices at various locations.This will bring fresh perspectives to established tasks in computer vision and benefit key areas such as human motion tracking, body pose estimation, or action recognition -- particularly for the lower body, which is typically occluded.   In this paper, we introduce EgoSim, a novel simulator of body-worn cameras that generates realistic egocentric renderings from multiple perspectives across a wearer's body.A key feature of EgoSim is its use of real motion capture data to render motion artifacts, which are especially noticeable with arm- or leg-worn cameras.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, we introduce MultiEgoView, a dataset of egocentric footage from six body-worn cameras and ground-truth full-body 3D poses during several activities: 119 hours of data are derived from AMASS motion sequences in four high-fidelity virtual environments, which we augment with 5 hours of real-world motion data from 13 participants using six GoPro cameras and 3D body pose references from an Xsens motion capture suit.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.833</span></span>We demonstrate EgoSim's effectiveness by training an end-to-end video-only 3D pose estimation network.Analyzing its domain gap, we show that our dataset and simulator substantially aid training for inference on real-world data.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>EgoSim code & MultiEgoView dataset: https://siplab.org/projects/EgoSim <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.836</span></span></p>

                  <p>Masked language modelling (MLM) as a pretraining objective has been widely adopted in genomic sequence modelling.While pretrained models can successfully serve as encoders for various downstream tasks, the distribution shift between pretraining and inference detrimentally impacts performance, as the pretraining task is to map [MASK] tokens to predictions, yet the [MASK] is absent during downstream applications.This means the encoder does not prioritize its encodings of non-[MASK] tokens, and expends parameters and compute on work only relevant to the MLM task, despite this being irrelevant at deployment time.In this work, we propose a modified encoder-decoder architecture based on the masked autoencoder framework, designed to address this inefficiency within a BERT-based transformer.We empirically show that the resulting mismatch is particularly detrimental in genomic pipelines where models are often used for feature extraction without fine-tuning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate our approach on the BIOSCAN-5M dataset, comprising over 2 million unique DNA barcodes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.727</span></span>We achieve substantial performance gains in both closed-world and open-world classification tasks when compared against causal models and bidirectional architectures pretrained with MLM tasks.</p>

                  <p>Question answering on the hybrid context of tables and text (TATQA) is a critical task, with broad applications in data-intensive domains.However, existing TATQA datasets are limited to English, leading to several drawbacks: (i) They overlook the challenges of multilingual TAT-QA and cannot assess model performance in the multilingual setting.(ii) They do not reflect real-world scenarios where tables and texts frequently appear in non-English languages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address the limitations, we propose the first multilingual TATQA dataset (MULTITAT). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.851</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, we sample data from 3 mainstream TATQA datasets and translate it into 10 diverse languages. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.759</span></span>To align the model TATQA capabilities in English with other languages, we develop a baseline, Ours.Experimental results reveal that the performance on non-English data in MULTITAT drops by an average of 19.4% compared to English, proving the necessity of MULTITAT.We further analyze the reasons for this performance gap.Furthermore, Ours outperforms other baselines by an average of 3.3, demonstrating its effectiveness.</p>

                  <p>Our ability to continuously acquire, organize, and leverage knowledge is a key feature of human intelligence that AI systems must approximate to unlock their full potential.Given the challenges in continual learning with large language models (LLMs), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become the dominant way to introduce new information.However, its reliance on vector retrieval hinders its ability to mimic the dynamic and interconnected nature of human long-term memory.Recent RAG approaches augment vector embeddings with various structures like knowledge graphs to address some of these gaps, namely sense-making and associativity.However, their performance on more basic factual memory tasks drops considerably below standard RAG.We address this unintended deterioration and propose HippoRAG 2, a framework that outperforms standard RAG comprehensively on factual, sense-making, and associative memory tasks.HippoRAG 2 builds upon the Personalized PageRank algorithm used in HippoRAG and enhances it with deeper passage integration and more effective online use of an LLM.This combination pushes this RAG system closer to the effectiveness of human long-term memory, achieving a 7% improvement in associative memory tasks over the state-of-the-art embedding model while also exhibiting superior factual knowledge and sense-making memory capabilities.This work paves the way for non-parametric continual learning for LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and data will be released at https://github.com/OSU-NLP-Group/HippoRAG. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.727</span></span></p>

                  <p>Existing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) can process inputs with context lengths up to 128k visual and text tokens, yet they struggle to generate coherent outputs beyond 1,000 words.We find that the primary limitation is the absence of long output examples during supervised fine-tuning (SFT).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To tackle this issue, we introduce LongWriter-V-22k, a SFT dataset comprising 22,158 examples, each with multiple input images, an instruction, and corresponding outputs ranging from 0 to 10,000 words. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.82</span></span>Moreover, to achieve long outputs that maintain high-fidelity to the input images, we employ Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to the SFT model.Given the high cost of collecting human feedback for lengthy outputs (e.g., 3,000 words), we propose IterDPO, which breaks long outputs into segments and uses iterative corrections to form preference pairs with the original outputs.Additionally, we develop MMLongBench-Write, a benchmark featuring six tasks to evaluate the long-generation capabilities of VLMs.Our 7B parameter model, trained with LongWriter-V-22k and IterDPO, achieves impressive performance on this benchmark, outperforming larger proprietary models like GPT-4o.Code and data: https://github.com/THU-KEG/LongWriter-V</p>

                  <p>Reasoning about images with rich text, such as charts and documents, is a critical application of vision-language models (VLMs).However, VLMs often struggle in these domains due to the scarcity of diverse text-rich vision-language data.To address this challenge, we present CoSyn, a framework that leverages the coding capabilities of text-only large language models (LLMs) to automatically create synthetic text-rich multimodal data.Given input text describing a target domain (e.g., "nutrition fact labels"), CoSyn prompts an LLM to generate code (Python, HTML, LaTeX, etc.) for rendering synthetic images.With the underlying code as textual representations of the synthetic images, CoSyn can generate high-quality instruction-tuning data, again relying on a text-only LLM.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Using CoSyn, we constructed a dataset comprising 400K images and 2.7M rows of vision-language instruction-tuning data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.834</span></span>Comprehensive experiments on seven benchmarks demonstrate that models trained on our synthetic data achieve state-of-the-art performance among competitive open-source models, including Llama 3.2, and surpass proprietary models such as GPT-4V and Gemini 1.5 Flash.Furthermore, CoSyn can produce synthetic pointing data, enabling VLMs to ground information within input images, showcasing its potential for developing multimodal agents capable of acting in real-world environments.</p>

                  <p>This paper presents DataSciBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities in data science.Recent related benchmarks have primarily focused on single tasks, easily obtainable ground truth, and straightforward evaluation metrics, which limits the scope of tasks that can be evaluated.In contrast, DataSciBench is constructed based on a more comprehensive and curated collection of natural and challenging prompts for uncertain ground truth and evaluation metrics.We develop a semi-automated pipeline for generating ground truth (GT) and validating evaluation metrics.This pipeline utilizes and implements an LLM-based self-consistency and human verification strategy to produce accurate GT by leveraging collected prompts, predefined task types, and aggregate functions (metrics).Furthermore, we propose an innovative Task - Function - Code (TFC) framework to assess each code execution outcome based on precisely defined metrics and programmatic rules.Our experimental framework involves testing 6 API-based models, 8 open-source general models, and 9 open-source code generation models using the diverse set of prompts we have gathered.This approach aims to provide a more comprehensive and rigorous evaluation of LLMs in data science, revealing their strengths and weaknesses.Experimental results demonstrate that API-based models outperform open-sourced models on all metrics and Deepseek-Coder-33B-Instruct achieves the highest score among open-sourced models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We release all code and data at https://github.com/THUDM/DataSciBench. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.808</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent studies have shown that Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) tend to neglect image content and over-rely on language-model priors, resulting in errors in visually grounded tasks and hallucinations.We hypothesize that this issue arises because existing VLMs are not explicitly trained to generate texts that are accurately grounded in fine-grained image details.To enhance visual feedback during VLM training, we propose S-VCO (Symmetrical Visual Contrastive Optimization), a novel finetuning objective that steers the model toward capturing important visual details and aligning them with corresponding text tokens.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To further facilitate this detailed alignment, we introduce MVC, a paired image-text dataset built by automatically filtering and augmenting visual counterfactual data to challenge the model with hard contrastive cases involving Minimal Visual Contrasts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.744</span></span>Experiments show that our method consistently improves VLM performance across diverse benchmarks covering various abilities and domains, achieving up to a 22% reduction in hallucinations, and significant gains in vision-centric and general tasks.Notably, these improvements become increasingly pronounced in benchmarks with higher visual dependency.In short, S-VCO offers a significant enhancement of VLM's visually-dependent task performance while retaining or even improving the model's general abilities.We opensource our code at https://s-vco.github.io/</p>

                  <p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in learning joint representations of visual and textual data, making them powerful tools for tasks such as Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL).CZSL requires models to generalize to novel combinations of visual primitives-such as attributes and objects-that were not explicitly encountered during training.Recent works in prompting for CZSL have focused on modifying inputs for the text encoder, often using static prompts that do not change across varying visual contexts.However, these approaches struggle to fully capture varying visual contexts, as they focus on text adaptation rather than leveraging visual features for compositional reasoning.To address this, we propose Visual Adaptive Prompting System (VAPS) that leverages a learnable visual prompt repository and similarity-based retrieval mechanism within the framework of VLMs to bridge the gap between semantic and visual features.Our method introduces a dynamic visual prompt repository mechanism that selects the most relevant attribute and object prompts based on the visual features of the image.Our proposed system includes a visual prompt adapter that encourages the model to learn a more generalizable embedding space.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments on three CZSL benchmarks, across both closed and open-world scenarios, demonstrate state-of-the-art results. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.658</span></span></p>

                  <p>High energy consumption remains a key challenge in high-performance computing (HPC) systems, which often feature hundreds or thousands of nodes drawing substantial power even in idle or standby modes.Although powering down unused nodes can improve energy efficiency, choosing the wrong time to do so can degrade quality of service by delaying job execution.Machine learning, in particular reinforcement learning (RL), has shown promise in determining optimal times to switch nodes on or off.In this study, we enhance the performance of a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent for HPC power management by integrating curriculum learning (CL), a training approach that introduces tasks with gradually increasing difficulty.Using the Batsim-py simulation framework, we compare the proposed CL-based agent to both a baseline DRL method (without CL) and the conventional fixed-time timeout strategy.Experimental results confirm that an easy-to-hard curriculum outperforms other training orders in terms of reducing wasted energy usage.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The best agent achieves a 3.73% energy reduction over the baseline DRL method and a 4.66% improvement compared to the best timeout configuration (shutdown every 15 minutes of idle time). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.608</span></span>In addition, it reduces average job waiting time by 9.24% and maintains a higher job-filling rate, indicating more effective resource utilization.Sensitivity tests across various switch-on durations, power levels, and cluster sizes further reveal the agent's adaptability to changing system parameters without retraining.These findings demonstrate that curriculum learning can significantly improve DRL-based power management in HPC, balancing energy savings, quality of service, and robustness to diverse configurations.</p>

                  <p>Network alignment, which aims to find node correspondence across different networks, is the cornerstone of various downstream multi-network and Web mining tasks.Most of the embedding-based methods indirectly model cross-network node relationships by contrasting positive and negative node pairs sampled from hand-crafted strategies, which are vulnerable to graph noises and lead to potential misalignment of nodes.Another line of work based on the optimal transport (OT) theory directly models cross-network node relationships and generates noise-reduced alignments.However, OT methods heavily rely on fixed, pre-defined cost functions that prohibit end-to-end training and are hard to generalize.In this paper, we aim to unify the embedding and OT-based methods in a mutually beneficial manner and propose a joint optimal transport and embedding framework for network alignment named JOENA.For one thing (OT for embedding), through a simple yet effective transformation, the noise-reduced OT mapping serves as an adaptive sampling strategy directly modeling all cross-network node pairs for robust embedding learning.For another (embedding for OT), on top of the learned embeddings, the OT cost can be gradually trained in an end-to-end fashion, which further enhances the alignment quality.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>With a unified objective, the mutual benefits of both methods can be achieved by an alternating optimization schema with guaranteed convergence. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span>Extensive experiments on real-world networks validate the effectiveness and scalability of JOENA, achieving up to 16% improvement in MRR and 20x speedup compared with the state-of-the-art alignment methods.</p>

                  <p>Cryptocurrencies fluctuate in markets with high price volatility, posing significant challenges for investors.To aid in informed decision-making, systems predicting cryptocurrency market movements have been developed, typically focusing on historical patterns.However, these methods often overlook three critical factors influencing market dynamics: 1) the macro investing environment, reflected in major cryptocurrency fluctuations affecting collaborative investor behaviors; 2) overall market sentiment, heavily influenced by news impacting investor strategies; and 3) technical indicators, offering insights into overbought or oversold conditions, momentum, and market trends, which are crucial for short-term price movements.This paper proposes a dual prediction mechanism that forecasts the next day's closing price by incorporating macroeconomic fluctuations, technical indicators, and individual cryptocurrency price changes.Additionally, a novel refinement mechanism enhances predictions through market sentiment-based rescaling and fusion.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments demonstrate that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming ten comparison methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.756</span></span></p>

                  <p>LiDAR registration is a fundamental task in robotic mapping and localization.A critical component of aligning two point clouds is identifying robust point correspondences using point descriptors.This step becomes particularly challenging in scenarios involving domain shifts, seasonal changes, and variations in point cloud structures.These factors substantially impact both handcrafted and learning-based approaches.In this paper, we address these problems by proposing to use DINOv2 features, obtained from surround-view images, as point descriptors.We demonstrate that coupling these descriptors with traditional registration algorithms, such as RANSAC or ICP, facilitates robust 6DoF alignment of LiDAR scans with 3D maps, even when the map was recorded more than a year before.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Although conceptually straightforward, our method substantially outperforms more complex baseline techniques. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.701</span></span>In contrast to previous learning-based point descriptors, our method does not require domain-specific retraining and is agnostic to the point cloud structure, effectively handling both sparse LiDAR scans and dense 3D maps.We show that leveraging the additional camera data enables our method to outperform the best baseline by +24.8 and +17.3 registration recall on the NCLT and Oxford RobotCar datasets.We publicly release the registration benchmark and the code of our work on https://vfm-registration.cs.uni-freiburg.de.</p>

                  <p>Existing LLM-based agents have achieved strong performance on held-in tasks, but their generalizability to unseen tasks remains poor.Hence, some recent work focus on fine-tuning the policy model with more diverse tasks to improve the generalizability.In this work, we find that finetuning a reward model to guide the policy model is more robust than directly finetuning the policy model.Based on this finding, we propose AgentRM, a generalizable reward model, to guide the policy model for effective test-time search.We comprehensively investigate three approaches to construct the reward model, including explicit reward modeling, implicit reward modeling and LLM-as-a-judge.We then use AgentRM to guide the answer generation with Best-of-N sampling and step-level beam search.On four types of nine agent tasks, AgentRM enhances the base policy model by $8.8$ points on average, surpassing the top general agent by $4.0$. Moreover, it demonstrates weak-to-strong generalization, yielding greater improvement of $12.6$ on LLaMA-3-70B policy model.As for the specializability, AgentRM can also boost a finetuned policy model and outperform the top specialized agent by $11.4$ on three held-in tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Further analysis verifies its effectiveness in test-time scaling. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.684</span></span>Codes will be released to facilitate the research in this area.</p>

                  <p>The rapid advancements in computing dramatically increase the scale and cost of training Large Language Models (LLMs).Accurately predicting downstream task performance prior to model training is crucial for efficient resource allocation, yet remains challenging due to two primary constraints: (1) the "emergence phenomenon", wherein downstream performance metrics become meaningful only after extensive training, which limits the ability to use smaller models for prediction; (2) Uneven task difficulty distributions and the absence of consistent scaling laws, resulting in substantial metric variability.Existing performance prediction methods suffer from limited accuracy and reliability, thereby impeding the assessment of potential LLM capabilities.To address these challenges, we propose a Clustering-On-Difficulty (COD) downstream performance prediction framework.COD first constructs a predictable support subset by clustering tasks based on difficulty features, strategically excluding non-emergent and non-scalable clusters.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The scores on the selected subset serve as effective intermediate predictors of downstream performance on the full evaluation set. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.61</span></span>With theoretical support, we derive a mapping function that transforms performance metrics from the predictable subset to the full evaluation set, thereby ensuring accurate extrapolation of LLM downstream performance.The proposed method has been applied to predict performance scaling for a 70B LLM, providing actionable insights for training resource allocation and assisting in monitoring the training process.Notably, COD achieves remarkable predictive accuracy on the 70B LLM by leveraging an ensemble of small models, demonstrating an absolute mean deviation of 1.36% across eight important LLM evaluation benchmarks.</p>

The first algorithm uses $O(\frac{t}{\varepsilon}\log\frac{t}{\varepsilon})$ queries and is given the value of $t$ in advance.The second algorithm does not have explicit knowledge of the value of $t$ and therefore needs to gain implicit knowledge of the straightness of the input curves through its queries.We show that the discrete Fr\'echet distance can still be tested using roughly $O(\frac{t^3+t^2\log n}{\varepsilon})$ queries ignoring logarithmic factors in $t$. Our algorithms work in a matrix representation of the input and may be of independent interest to matrix testing.Our algorithms use a mild uniform sampling condition that constrains the edge lengths of the curves, similar to a polynomially bounded aspect ratio.Applied to testing the continuous Fr\'echet distance of $t$-straight curves, our algorithms can be used for $(1+\varepsilon')$-approximate testing using essentially the same bounds as stated above with an additional factor of poly$(\frac{1}{\varepsilon'})$.</p>

                  <p>Next-generation touristic services will rely on the advanced mobile networks' high bandwidth and low latency and the Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) paradigm to provide fully immersive mobile experiences.As an integral part of travel planning systems, recommendation algorithms devise personalized tour itineraries for individual users considering the popularity of a city's Points of Interest (POIs) as well as the tourist preferences and constraints.However, in the context of next-generation touristic services, recommendation algorithms should also consider the applications (e.g., social network, mobile video streaming, mobile augmented reality) the tourist will consume in the POIs and the quality in which the MEC infrastructure will deliver such applications.In this paper, we address the joint problem of recommending personalized tour itineraries for tourists and efficiently allocating MEC resources for advanced touristic applications.We formulate an optimization problem that maximizes the itinerary of individual tourists while optimizing the resource allocation at the network edge.We then propose an exact algorithm that quickly solves the problem optimally, considering instances of realistic size.Using a real-world location-based photo-sharing database, we conduct and present an exploratory analysis to understand preferences and users' visiting patterns.Using this understanding, we propose a methodology to identify user interest in applications.Finally, we evaluate our algorithm using this dataset.Results show that our algorithm outperforms a modified version of a state-of-the-art solution for personalized tour itinerary recommendation, demonstrating gains up to 11% for resource allocation efficiency and 40% for user experience.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, our algorithm performs similarly to the modified state-of-the-art solution regarding traditional itinerary recommendation metrics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span></p>

                  <p>Diffusion models (DMs) create samples from a data distribution by starting from random noise and iteratively solving a reverse-time ordinary differential equation (ODE).Because each step in the iterative solution requires an expensive neural function evaluation (NFE), there has been significant interest in approximately solving these diffusion ODEs with only a few NFEs without modifying the underlying model.However, in the few NFE regime, we observe that tracking the true ODE evolution is fundamentally impossible using traditional ODE solvers.In this work, we propose a new method that learns a good solver for the DM, which we call Solving for the Solver (S4S).S4S directly optimizes a solver to obtain good generation quality by learning to match the output of a strong teacher solver.We evaluate S4S on six different pre-trained DMs, including pixel-space and latent-space DMs for both conditional and unconditional sampling.In all settings, S4S uniformly improves the sample quality relative to traditional ODE solvers.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, our method is lightweight, data-free, and can be plugged in black-box on top of any discretization schedule or architecture to improve performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span>Building on top of this, we also propose S4S-Alt, which optimizes both the solver and the discretization schedule.By exploiting the full design space of DM solvers, with 5 NFEs, we achieve an FID of 3.73 on CIFAR10 and 13.26 on MS-COCO, representing a $1.5\times$ improvement over previous training-free ODE methods.</p>

                  <p>In this paper, we address the challenge of determining the layer-wise sparsity rates of large language models (LLMs) through a theoretical perspective.Specifically, we identify a critical issue of ''$\textbf{reconstruction error explosion}$'' in existing LLMs sparsification methods.This refers to the cumulative effect of reconstruction errors throughout the sparsification process, where errors from earlier layers propagate and amplify in subsequent layers.As a result, the overall reconstruction error increases significantly, leading to a substantial degradation in model performance.Through theoretical analysis, we derive a simple yet effective approach to layer-wise sparsity allocation that mitigates this issue.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our method uses a monotonically increasing arithmetic progression, reducing the process of determining sparsity rates for multiple layers to the determination of a single common difference hyperparameter. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.643</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Remarkably, this allows for the optimal layer-wise sparsity rates to be identified with just a few trials. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.657</span></span>Both our theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that this sparsity allocation scheme is near optimal.Extensive experiments show that our method significantly improves the performance of sparse LLMs across various architectures, outperforming existing layer-wise sparsity methods.Furthermore, it enhances the performance of various compression techniques and is applicable to vision and multimodal models.Notably, our method achieves a reduction of 52.10 in perplexity for the 70$\%$ sparse LLaMA2-7B model obtained via Wanda, improves average zero-shot accuracy by 10.50$\%$, and delivers speedups of 2.63$\times$ and 2.23$\times$ on CPU and GPU, respectively.</p>

                  <p>Suppose we have a tool for finding super-maximal exact matches (SMEMs) and we want to use it to find all the long SMEMs between a noisy long read $P$ and a highly repetitive pangenomic reference $T$. Notice that if $L \geq k$ and the $k$-mer $P[i..i+ k - 1]$ does not occur in $T$ then no SMEM of length at least $L$ contains $P[i..i+ k - 1]$.Therefore, if we have a Bloom filter for the distinct $k$-mers in $T$ and we want to find only SMEMs of length $L \geq k$, then when given $P$ we can break it into maximal substrings consisting only of $k$-mers the filter says occur in $T$ -- which we call pseudo-SMEMs -- and search only the ones of length at least $L$. If $L$ is reasonably large and we can choose $k$ well then the Bloom filter should be small (because $T$ is highly repetitive) but the total length of the pseudo-SMEMs we search should also be small (because $P$ is noisy).Now suppose we are interested only in the longest $t$ SMEMs of length at least $L$ between $P$ and $T$. Notice that once we have found $t$ SMEMs of length at least $\ell$ then we need only search for SMEMs of length greater than $\ell$. Therefore, if we sort the pseudo-SMEMs into non-increasing order by length, then we can stop searching once we have found $t$ SMEMs at least as long as the next pseudo-SMEM we would search.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our preliminary experiments indicate that these two admissible heuristics may significantly speed up SMEM-finding in practice. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span></p>

                  <p>AI agents are increasingly being deployed to automate tasks, often based on ambiguous and underspecified user instructions.Making unwarranted assumptions and failing to ask clarifying questions can lead to suboptimal outcomes, safety risks due to tool misuse, and wasted computational resources.In this work, we study the ability of LLM agents to handle ambiguous instructions in interactive code generation settings by evaluating proprietary and open-weight models on their performance across three key steps: (a) leveraging interactivity to improve performance in ambiguous scenarios, (b) detecting ambiguity, and (c) asking targeted questions.Our findings reveal that models struggle to distinguish between well-specified and underspecified instructions.However, when models interact for underspecified inputs, they effectively obtain vital information from the user, leading to significant improvements in performance and underscoring the value of effective interaction.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our study highlights critical gaps in how current state-of-the-art models handle ambiguity in complex software engineering tasks and structures the evaluation into distinct steps to enable targeted improvements. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span></p>
