                  <p>People with Parkinson's Disease (PD) often experience progressively worsening gait, including changes in how they turn around, as the disease progresses.Existing clinical rating tools are not capable of capturing hour-by-hour variations of PD symptoms, as they are confined to brief assessments within clinic settings.Measuring real-world gait turning angles continuously and passively is a component step towards using gait characteristics as sensitive indicators of disease progression in PD.This paper presents a deep learning-based approach to automatically quantify turning angles by extracting 3D skeletons from videos and calculating the rotation of hip and knee joints.We utilise state-of-the-art human pose estimation models, Fastpose and Strided Transformer, on a total of 1386 turning video clips from 24 subjects (12 people with PD and 12 healthy control volunteers), trimmed from a PD dataset of unscripted free-living videos in a home-like setting (Turn-REMAP).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also curate a turning video dataset, Turn-H3.6M, from the public Human3.6M human pose benchmark with 3D ground truth, to further validate our method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.778</span></span>Previous gait research has primarily taken place in clinics or laboratories evaluating scripted gait outcomes, but this work focuses on real-world settings where complexities exist, such as baggy clothing and poor lighting.Due to difficulties in obtaining accurate ground truth data in a free-living setting, we quantise the angle into the nearest bin $45^\circ$ based on the manual labelling of expert clinicians.Our method achieves a turning calculation accuracy of 41.6%, a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 34.7{\deg}, and a weighted precision WPrec of 68.3% for Turn-REMAP.This is the first work to explore the use of single monocular camera data to quantify turns by PD patients in a home setting.</p>

                  <p>A soundscape is defined by the acoustic environment a person perceives at a location.In this work, we propose a framework for mapping soundscapes across the Earth.Since soundscapes involve sound distributions that span varying spatial scales, we represent locations with multi-scale satellite imagery and learn a joint representation among this imagery, audio, and text.To capture the inherent uncertainty in the soundscape of a location, we design the representation space to be probabilistic.We also fuse ubiquitous metadata (including geolocation, time, and data source) to enable learning of spatially and temporally dynamic representations of soundscapes.We demonstrate the utility of our framework by creating large-scale soundscape maps integrating both audio and text with temporal control.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To facilitate future research on this task, we also introduce a large-scale dataset, GeoSound, containing over $300k$ geotagged audio samples paired with both low- and high-resolution satellite imagery. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.89</span></span>We demonstrate that our method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art on both GeoSound and the existing SoundingEarth dataset.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our dataset and code is available at https://github.com/mvrl/PSM. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.777</span></span></p>

                  <p>Current long context large language models (LLMs) can process inputs up to 100,000 tokens, yet struggle to generate outputs exceeding even a modest length of 2,000 words.Through controlled experiments, we find that the model's effective generation length is inherently bounded by the sample it has seen during supervised fine-tuning (SFT).In other words, their output limitation is due to the scarcity of long-output examples in existing SFT datasets.To address this, we introduce AgentWrite, an agent-based pipeline that decomposes ultra-long generation tasks into subtasks, enabling off-the-shelf LLMs to generate coherent outputs exceeding 20,000 words.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Leveraging AgentWrite, we construct LongWriter-6k, a dataset containing 6,000 SFT data with output lengths ranging from 2k to 32k words. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.84</span></span>By incorporating this dataset into model training, we successfully scale the output length of existing models to over 10,000 words while maintaining output quality.We also develop LongBench-Write, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating ultra-long generation capabilities.Our 9B parameter model, further improved through DPO, achieves state-of-the-art performance on this benchmark, surpassing even much larger proprietary models.In general, our work demonstrates that existing long context LLM already possesses the potential for a larger output window--all you need is data with extended output during model alignment to unlock this capability.Our code & models are at: https://github.com/THUDM/LongWriter.</p>

                  <p>Standard natural language processing (NLP) pipelines operate on symbolic representations of language, which typically consist of sequences of discrete tokens.However, creating an analogous representation for ancient logographic writing systems is an extremely labor intensive process that requires expert knowledge.At present, a large portion of logographic data persists in a purely visual form due to the absence of transcription -- this issue poses a bottleneck for researchers seeking to apply NLP toolkits to study ancient logographic languages: most of the relevant data are images of writing.   This paper investigates whether direct processing of visual representations of language offers a potential solution.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We introduce LogogramNLP, the first benchmark enabling NLP analysis of ancient logographic languages, featuring both transcribed and visual datasets for four writing systems along with annotations for tasks like classification, translation, and parsing. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.731</span></span>Our experiments compare systems that employ recent visual and text encoding strategies as backbones.The results demonstrate that visual representations outperform textual representations for some investigated tasks, suggesting that visual processing pipelines may unlock a large amount of cultural heritage data of logographic languages for NLP-based analyses.</p>

                  <p>Vision transformers (ViTs) excel in computer vision for modeling long-term dependencies, yet face two key challenges for image quality assessment (IQA): discarding fine details during patch embedding, and requiring extensive training data due to lack of inductive biases.In this study, we propose a Global-Local progressive INTegration network for IQA, called GlintIQA, to address these issues through three key components: 1) Hybrid feature extraction combines ViT-based global feature extractor (VGFE) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs)-based local feature extractor (CLFE) to capture global coarse-grained features and local fine-grained features, respectively.The incorporation of CNNs mitigates the patch-level information loss and inductive bias constraints inherent to ViT architectures.2) Progressive feature integration leverages diverse kernel sizes in embedding to spatially align coarse- and fine-grained features, and progressively aggregate these features by interactively stacking channel-wise attention and spatial enhancement modules to build effective quality-aware representations.3) Content similarity-based labeling approach is proposed that automatically assigns quality labels to images with diverse content based on subjective quality scores.This addresses the scarcity of labeled training data in synthetic datasets and bolsters model generalization.The experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, yielding 5.04% average SROCC gains on cross-authentic dataset evaluations.Moreover, our model and its counterpart pre-trained on the proposed dataset respectively exhibited 5.40% and 13.23% improvements on across-synthetic datasets evaluation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The codes and proposed dataset will be released at https://github.com/XiaoqiWang/GlintIQA. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.778</span></span></p>

                  <p>Existing plant disease classification models have achieved remarkable performance in recognizing in-laboratory diseased images.However, their performance often significantly degrades in classifying in-the-wild images.Furthermore, we observed that in-the-wild plant images may exhibit similar appearances across various diseases (i.e., small inter-class discrepancy) while the same diseases may look quite different (i.e., large intra-class variance).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Motivated by this observation, we propose an in-the-wild multimodal plant disease recognition dataset that contains the largest number of disease classes but also text-based descriptions for each disease. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.785</span></span>Particularly, the newly provided text descriptions are introduced to provide rich information in textual modality and facilitate in-the-wild disease classification with small inter-class discrepancy and large intra-class variance issues.Therefore, our proposed dataset can be regarded as an ideal testbed for evaluating disease recognition methods in the real world.In addition, we further present a strong yet versatile baseline that models text descriptions and visual data through multiple prototypes for a given class.By fusing the contributions of multimodal prototypes in classification, our baseline can effectively address the small inter-class discrepancy and large intra-class variance issues.Remarkably, our baseline model can not only classify diseases but also recognize diseases in few-shot or training-free scenarios.Extensive benchmarking results demonstrate that our proposed in-the-wild multimodal dataset sets many new challenges to the plant disease recognition task and there is a large space to improve for future works.</p>

This study develops an event encoder without relying on additional reconstruction networks.We theoretically analyze the performance bottlenecks of previous approaches: global similarity-based objective (i.e., maximizing the embedding similarities) cause semantic misalignments between the learned event embedding space and the CLIP text embedding space due to the degree of freedom.To mitigate the issue, we explore a scalar-wise regularization strategy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, to scale up the number of events and RGB data pairs for training, we also propose a pipeline for synthesizing event data from static RGB images.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.752</span></span>Experimentally, our data synthesis strategy exhibits an attractive scaling property, and our method achieves superior zero-shot object recognition performance on extensive standard benchmark datasets, even compared with past supervised learning approaches.For example, we achieve 47.84% zero-shot accuracy on the N-ImageNet dataset.</p>

                  <p>Task-specific data-fusion networks have marked considerable achievements in urban scene parsing.Among these networks, our recently proposed RoadFormer successfully extracts heterogeneous features from RGB images and surface normal maps and fuses these features through attention mechanisms, demonstrating compelling efficacy in RGB-Normal road scene parsing.However, its performance significantly deteriorates when handling other types/sources of data or performing more universal, all-category scene parsing tasks.To overcome these limitations, this study introduces RoadFormer+, an efficient, robust, and adaptable model capable of effectively fusing RGB-X data, where ``X'', represents additional types/modalities of data such as depth, thermal, surface normal, and polarization.Specifically, we propose a novel hybrid feature decoupling encoder to extract heterogeneous features and decouple them into global and local components.These decoupled features are then fused through a dual-branch multi-scale heterogeneous feature fusion block, which employs parallel Transformer attentions and convolutional neural network modules to merge multi-scale features across different scales and receptive fields.The fused features are subsequently fed into a decoder to generate the final semantic predictions.Notably, our proposed RoadFormer+ ranks first on the KITTI Road benchmark and achieves state-of-the-art performance in mean intersection over union on the Cityscapes, MFNet, FMB, and ZJU datasets.Moreover, it reduces the number of learnable parameters by 65\% compared to RoadFormer.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our source code will be publicly available at mias.group/RoadFormerPlus. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.715</span></span></p>

                  <p>Human head detection, keypoint estimation, and 3D head model fitting are important tasks with many applications.However, traditional real-world datasets often suffer from bias, privacy, and ethical concerns, and they have been recorded in laboratory environments, which makes it difficult for trained models to generalize.Here, we introduce VGGHeads -- a large scale synthetic dataset generated with diffusion models for human head detection and 3D mesh estimation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our dataset comprises over 1 million high-resolution images, each annotated with detailed 3D head meshes, facial landmarks, and bounding boxes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.904</span></span>Using this dataset we introduce a new model architecture capable of simultaneous heads detection and head meshes reconstruction from a single image in a single step.Through extensive experimental evaluations, we demonstrate that models trained on our synthetic data achieve strong performance on real images.Furthermore, the versatility of our dataset makes it applicable across a broad spectrum of tasks, offering a general and comprehensive representation of human heads.Additionally, we provide detailed information about the synthetic data generation pipeline, enabling it to be re-used for other tasks and domains.</p>

                  <p>In this work, we make the first attempt to construct a learning-based single-point annotation paradigm for infrared small target label generation (IRSTLG).Our intuition is that label generation requires just one more point prompt than target detection: IRSTLG can be regarded as an infrared small target detection (IRSTD) task with the target location hint.Based on this insight, we introduce an energy double guided single-point prompt (EDGSP) framework, which adeptly transforms the target detection network into a refined label generation method.Specifically, the proposed EDGSP includes: 1) target energy initialization (TEI) to create a foundational outline for sufficient shape evolution of pseudo label, 2) double prompt embedding (DPE) for rapid localization of interested regions and reinforcement of individual differences to avoid label adhesion, and 3) bounding box-based matching (BBM) to eliminate false alarms.Experimental results show that pseudo labels generated by three baselines equipped with EDGSP achieve 100% object-level probability of detection (Pd) and 0% false-alarm rate (Fa) on SIRST, NUDT-SIRST, and IRSTD-1k datasets, with a pixel-level intersection over union (IoU) improvement of 13.28% over state-of-the-art label generation methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, the downstream detection task reveals that our centroid-annotated pseudo labels surpass full labels, even with coarse single-point annotations, it still achieves 99.5% performance of full labeling. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.639</span></span></p>

Our objective is to streamline the labelling of files with the correct application domains using source code as input.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To achieve this, in prior work, we evaluated the ability to annotate files automatically using a weak labelling approach.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.681</span></span>This paper presents AutoFL, a tool for automatically labelling software repositories from source code.AutoFL allows multi-granular annotations including: \textit{file}, \textit{package}, and \textit{project} -level.   We provide an overview of the tool's internals, present an example analysis for which AutoFL can be used, and discuss limitations and future work.</p>

                  <p>Real-world data consistently exhibits a long-tailed distribution, often spanning multiple categories.This complexity underscores the challenge of content comprehension, particularly in scenarios requiring Long-Tailed Multi-Label image Classification (LTMLC).In such contexts, imbalanced data distribution and multi-object recognition pose significant hurdles.To address this issue, we propose a novel and effective approach for LTMLC, termed Category-Prompt Refined Feature Learning (CPRFL), utilizing semantic correlations between different categories and decoupling category-specific visual representations for each category.Specifically, CPRFL initializes category-prompts from the pretrained CLIP's embeddings and decouples category-specific visual representations through interaction with visual features, thereby facilitating the establishment of semantic correlations between the head and tail classes.To mitigate the visual-semantic domain bias, we design a progressive Dual-Path Back-Propagation mechanism to refine the prompts by progressively incorporating context-related visual information into prompts.Simultaneously, the refinement process facilitates the progressive purification of the category-specific visual representations under the guidance of the refined prompts.Furthermore, taking into account the negative-positive sample imbalance, we adopt the Asymmetric Loss as our optimization objective to suppress negative samples across all classes and potentially enhance the head-to-tail recognition performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We validate the effectiveness of our method on two LTMLC benchmarks and extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our work over baselines.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.707</span></span>The code is available at https://github.com/jiexuanyan/CPRFL.</p>

                  <p>During software development, developers often make numerous modifications to the software to address existing issues or implement new features.However, certain changes may inadvertently have a detrimental impact on the overall system performance.To ensure that the performance of new software releases does not degrade, existing practices rely on system-level performance testing, such as load testing, or component-level performance testing to detect performance regressions.However, performance testing for the entire system is often expensive and time-consuming, posing challenges to adapting to the rapid release cycles common in modern DevOps practices.System-level performance testing cannot be conducted until the system is fully built and deployed.On the other hand, component-level testing focuses on isolated components, neglecting overall system performance and the impact of system workloads.   In this paper, we propose a novel approach to early detection of performance regressions by bridging the local performance data generated by component-level testing and the system-level architectural models.Our approach uses local performance data to identify deviations at the component level, and then propagate these deviations to the architectural model.We then use the architectural model to predict regressions in the performance of the overall system.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate our approach on two open-source benchmark systems and show that it can effectively detect end-to-end system performance regressions from local performance deviations with different intensities and under various system workloads. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.719</span></span>More importantly, our approach can detect regressions as early as in the development phase, in contrast to existing approaches that require the system to be fully built and deployed.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our approach is lightweight and can complement traditional system performance testing when testing resources are scarce. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.637</span></span></p>

                  <p>Human motion prediction is crucial for human-centric multimedia understanding and interacting.Current methods typically rely on ground truth human poses as observed input, which is not practical for real-world scenarios where only raw visual sensor data is available.To implement these methods in practice, a pre-phrase of pose estimation is essential.However, such two-stage approaches often lead to performance degradation due to the accumulation of errors.Moreover, reducing raw visual data to sparse keypoint representations significantly diminishes the density of information, resulting in the loss of fine-grained features.In this paper, we propose \textit{LiDAR-HMP}, the first single-LiDAR-based 3D human motion prediction approach, which receives the raw LiDAR point cloud as input and forecasts future 3D human poses directly.Building upon our novel structure-aware body feature descriptor, LiDAR-HMP adaptively maps the observed motion manifold to future poses and effectively models the spatial-temporal correlations of human motions for further refinement of prediction results.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on two public benchmarks and demonstrates remarkable robustness and efficacy in real-world deployments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span></p>

                  <p>Object pose estimation is essential to many industrial applications involving robotic manipulation, navigation, and augmented reality.Current generalizable object pose estimators, i.e., approaches that do not need to be trained per object, rely on accurate 3D models.Predominantly, CAD models are used, which can be hard to obtain in practice.At the same time, it is often possible to acquire images of an object.Naturally, this leads to the question whether 3D models reconstructed from images are sufficient to facilitate accurate object pose estimation.We aim to answer this question by proposing a novel benchmark for measuring the impact of 3D reconstruction quality on pose estimation accuracy.Our benchmark provides calibrated images for object reconstruction registered with the test images of the YCB-V dataset for pose evaluation under the BOP benchmark format.Detailed experiments with multiple state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction and object pose estimation approaches show that the geometry produced by modern reconstruction methods is often sufficient for accurate pose estimation.Our experiments lead to interesting observations: (1) Standard metrics for measuring 3D reconstruction quality are not necessarily indicative of pose estimation accuracy, which shows the need for dedicated benchmarks such as ours.(2) Classical, non-learning-based approaches can perform on par with modern learning-based reconstruction techniques and can even offer a better reconstruction time-pose accuracy tradeoff.(3) There is still a sizable gap between performance with reconstructed and with CAD models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To foster research on closing this gap, our benchmark is publicly available at https://github.com/VarunBurde/reconstruction_pose_benchmark}. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span></p>

                  <p>Assessing the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) is often challenging, in part, because it is hard to find tasks to which they have not been exposed during training.We take one step to address this challenge by turning to a new task: focusing on symbolic graphics programs, which are a popular representation for graphics content that procedurally generates visual data.LLMs have shown exciting promise towards program synthesis, but do they understand symbolic graphics programs?Unlike conventional programs, symbolic graphics programs can be translated to graphics content.Here, we characterize an LLM's understanding of symbolic programs in terms of their ability to answer questions related to the graphics content.This task is challenging as the questions are difficult to answer from the symbolic programs alone -- yet, they would be easy to answer from the corresponding graphics content as we verify through a human experiment.To understand symbolic programs, LLMs may need to possess the ability to imagine how the corresponding graphics content would look without directly accessing the rendered visual content.We use this task to evaluate LLMs by creating a large benchmark for the semantic understanding of symbolic graphics programs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This benchmark is built via program-graphics correspondence, hence requiring minimal human efforts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.7</span></span>We evaluate current LLMs on our benchmark to elucidate a preliminary assessment of their ability to reason about visual scenes from programs.We find that this task distinguishes existing LLMs and models considered good at reasoning perform better.Lastly, we introduce Symbolic Instruction Tuning (SIT) to improve this ability.Specifically, we query GPT4-o with questions and images generated by symbolic programs.Such data are then used to finetune an LLM.We also find that SIT data can improve the general instruction following ability of LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Experimentation is an essential method for causal inference in any empirical discipline.Crossover-design experiments are common in Software Engineering (SE) research.In these, subjects apply more than one treatment in different orders.This design increases the amount of obtained data and deals with subject variability but introduces threats to internal validity like the learning and carryover effect.Vegas et al. reviewed the state of practice for crossover designs in SE research and provided guidelines on how to address its threats during data analysis while still harnessing its benefits.In this paper, we reflect on the impact of these guidelines and review the state of analysis of crossover design experiments in SE publications between 2015 and March 2024.To this end, by conducting a forward snowballing of the guidelines, we survey 136 publications reporting 67 crossover-design experiments and evaluate their data analysis against the provided guidelines.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results show that the validity of data analyses has improved compared to the original state of analysis. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span>Still, despite the explicit guidelines, only 29.5% of all threats to validity were addressed properly.While the maturation and the optimal sequence threats are properly addressed in 35.8% and 38.8% of all studies in our sample respectively, the carryover threat is only modeled in about 3% of the observed cases.The lack of adherence to the analysis guidelines threatens the validity of the conclusions drawn from crossover design experiments</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have greatly contributed to the development of adaptive intelligent agents and are positioned as an important way to achieve Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).However, LLMs are prone to produce factually incorrect information and often produce "phantom" content that undermines their reliability, which poses a serious challenge for their deployment in real-world scenarios.Enhancing LLMs by combining external databases and information retrieval mechanisms is an effective path.To address the above challenges, we propose a new approach called WeKnow-RAG, which integrates Web search and Knowledge Graphs into a "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)" system.First, the accuracy and reliability of LLM responses are improved by combining the structured representation of Knowledge Graphs with the flexibility of dense vector retrieval.WeKnow-RAG then utilizes domain-specific knowledge graphs to satisfy a variety of queries and domains, thereby improving performance on factual information and complex reasoning tasks by employing multi-stage web page retrieval techniques using both sparse and dense retrieval methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our approach effectively balances the efficiency and accuracy of information retrieval, thus improving the overall retrieval process. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.623</span></span>Finally, we also integrate a self-assessment mechanism for the LLM to evaluate the trustworthiness of the answers it generates.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our approach proves its outstanding effectiveness in a wide range of offline experiments and online submissions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span></p>

                  <p>In many automated planning applications, action costs can be hard to specify.An example is the time needed to travel through a certain road segment, which depends on many factors, such as the current weather conditions.A natural way to address this issue is to learn to predict these parameters based on input features (e.g., weather forecasts) and use the predicted action costs in automated planning afterward.Decision-Focused Learning (DFL) has been successful in learning to predict the parameters of combinatorial optimization problems in a way that optimizes solution quality rather than prediction quality.This approach yields better results than treating prediction and optimization as separate tasks.In this paper, we investigate for the first time the challenges of implementing DFL for automated planning in order to learn to predict the action costs.There are two main challenges to overcome: (1) planning systems are called during gradient descent learning, to solve planning problems with negative action costs, which are not supported in planning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We propose novel methods for gradient computation to avoid this issue. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.609</span></span>(2) DFL requires repeated planner calls during training, which can limit the scalability of the method.We experiment with different methods approximating the optimal plan as well as an easy-to-implement caching mechanism to speed up the learning process.As the first work that addresses DFL for automated planning, we demonstrate that the proposed gradient computation consistently yields significantly better plans than predictions aimed at minimizing prediction error; and that caching can temper the computation requirements.</p>

                  <p>Recently, researchers have extended the concept of matchings to the more general problem of finding $b$-matchings in hypergraphs broadening the scope of potential applications and challenges.The concept of $b$-matchings, where $b$ is a function that assigns positive integers to the vertices of the graph, is a natural extension of matchings in graphs, where each vertex $v$ is allowed to be matched to up to $b(v)$ edges, rather than just one.The weighted $b$-matching problem then seeks to select a subset of the hyperedges that fulfills the constraint and maximizes the weight.   In this work, we engineer novel algorithms for this generalized problem.More precisely, we introduce exact data reductions for the problem as well as a novel greedy initial solution and local search algorithms.These data reductions allow us to significantly shrink the input size.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This is done by either determining if a hyperedge is guaranteed to be in an optimum $b$-matching and thus can be added to our solution or if it can be safely ignored. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.61</span></span>Our iterated local search algorithm provides a framework for finding suitable improvement swaps of edges.

                  <p>Motivated by applications in clustering and synthetic data generation, we consider the problem of releasing a minimum spanning tree (MST) under edge-weight differential privacy constraints where a graph topology $G=(V,E)$ with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges is public, the weight matrix $\vec{W}\in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ is private, and we wish to release an approximate MST under $\rho$-zero-concentrated differential privacy.Weight matrices are considered neighboring if they differ by at most $\Delta_\infty$ in each entry, i.e., we consider an $\ell_\infty$ neighboring relationship.Existing private MST algorithms either add noise to each entry in $\vec{W}$ and estimate the MST by post-processing or add noise to weights in-place during the execution of a specific MST algorithm.Using the post-processing approach with an efficient MST algorithm takes $O(n^2)$ time on dense graphs but results in an additive error on the weight of the MST of magnitude $O(n^2\log n)$.In-place algorithms give asymptotically better utility, but the running time of existing in-place algorithms is $O(n^3)$ for dense graphs.Our main result is a new differentially private MST algorithm that matches the utility of existing in-place methods while running in time $O(m + n^{3/2}\log n)$ for fixed privacy parameter $\rho$. The technical core of our algorithm is an efficient sublinear time simulation of Report-Noisy-Max that works by discretizing all edge weights to a multiple of $\Delta_\infty$ and forming groups of edges with identical weights.Specifically, we present a data structure that allows us to sample a noisy minimum weight edge among at most $O(n^2)$ cut edges in $O(\sqrt{n} \log n)$ time.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental evaluations support our claims that our algorithm significantly improves previous algorithms either in utility or running time. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.736</span></span></p>

                  <p>Logs are a first-hand source of information for software maintenance and failure diagnosis.Log parsing, which converts semi-structured log messages into structured templates, is a prerequisite for automated log analysis tasks such as anomaly detection, troubleshooting, and root cause analysis.However, existing log parsers fail in real-world systems for three main reasons.First, traditional heuristics-based parsers require handcrafted features and domain knowledge, which are difficult to generalize at scale.Second, existing large language model-based parsers rely on periodic offline processing, limiting their effectiveness in real-time use cases.Third, existing online parsing algorithms are susceptible to log drift, where slight log changes create false positives that drown out real anomalies.To address these challenges, we propose HELP, a Hierarchical Embeddings-based Log Parser.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>HELP is the first online semantic-based parser to leverage LLMs for performant and cost-effective log parsing. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.652</span></span>We achieve this through a novel hierarchical embeddings module, which fine-tunes a text embedding model to cluster logs before parsing, reducing querying costs by multiple orders of magnitude.To combat log drift, we also develop an iterative rebalancing module, which periodically updates existing log groupings.We evaluate HELP extensively on 14 public large-scale datasets, showing that HELP achieves significantly higher F1-weighted grouping and parsing accuracy than current state-of-the-art online log parsers.We also implement HELP into Iudex's production observability platform, confirming HELP's practicality in a production environment.Our results show that HELP is effective and efficient for high-throughput real-world log parsing.</p>

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to early detection of performance regressions by bridging the local performance data generated by component-level testing and the system-level architectural models.Our approach uses local performance data to identify deviations at the component level, and then propagate these deviations to the architectural model.We then use the architectural model to predict regressions in the performance of the overall system.We evaluate our approach on two open-source benchmark systems and show that it can effectively detect end-to-end system performance regressions from local performance deviations with different intensities and under various system workloads.More importantly, our approach can detect regressions as early as in the development phase, in contrast to existing approaches that require the system to be fully built and deployed.Our approach is lightweight and can complement traditional system performance testing when testing resources are scarce.</p>

                  <p>The Rust programming language has garnered significant attention due to its robust safety features and memory management capabilities.Despite its guaranteed memory safety, Rust programs still suffer from runtime errors that are unmanageable, i.e., panic errors.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Notably, over half of the bugs in rustc, Rust's own compiler, are attributable to crash stemming from panic errors. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>However, understanding root causes and resolving these panics often requires substantial effort due to the limited information provided, and the stack backtrace could be intricate, often omitting the actual fault locations.Although numerous automated program repair techniques exist, we observe that the prevailing fix patterns do not readily apply to Rust programs due to natural differences in language mechanisms.To tackle the above challenges, this paper introduces a systematic study aimed at fixing Rust panic bugs.We commence by assembling a dataset, namely Panic4R, which includes 102 real panic bugs and their fixes from the top 500 most downloaded open-source crates.By analyzing Rust's implementation, we identify Rust-specific patterns for fixing panic bugs, which can aid in understanding and providing guidance for generating patches.Finally, we design and implement the first automated fixing tool, PanicKiller, for Rust panic bugs, which effectively generates correct patches on the real-world large-scale dataset, and has already assisted in the resolution of 28 panic bugs in open-source projects.Each resolved issue has been validated by the developers and merged into the respective codebases.</p>

To address this limitation, we propose a self-directed LLM-based automated program repair, ThinkRepair, with two main phases: collection phase and fixing phase.The former phase automatically collects various chains of thoughts that constitute pre-fixed knowledge by instructing LLMs with the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompt.The latter phase targets fixing a bug by first selecting examples for few-shot learning and second automatically interacting with LLMs, optionally appending with feedback of testing information.   Evaluations on two widely studied datasets (Defects4J and QuixBugs) by comparing ThinkRepair with 12 SOTA APRs indicate the priority of ThinkRepair in fixing bugs.Notably, ThinkRepair fixes 98 bugs and improves baselines by 27%-344.4% on Defects4J V1.2.On Defects4J V2.0, ThinkRepair fixes 12-65 more bugs than the SOTA APRs.Additionally, ThinkRepair also makes a considerable improvement on QuixBugs (31 for Java and 21 for Python at most).</p>
