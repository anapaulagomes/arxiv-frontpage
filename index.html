                  <p>Currently, the destruction of the sequence structure in handwritten text has become one of the main bottlenecks restricting the recognition task.The typical situations include additional specific markers (the text swapping modification) and the text overlap caused by character modifications like deletion, replacement, and insertion.In this paper, we propose a two-stage detection algorithm that combines structure knowledge and deep models for the above mentioned text.Firstly, different structure prototypes are roughly located from handwritten text images.Based on the detection results of the first stage, in the second stage, we adopt different strategies.Specifically, a shape regression network trained by a novel semi-supervised contrast training strategy is introduced and the positional relationship between the characters is fully employed.Experiments on two handwritten text datasets show that the proposed method can greatly improve the detection performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The new dataset is available at https://github.com/Wukong90. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.915</span></span></p>

                  <p>Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) offers significant benefits such as reduced recovery time and minimised patient trauma, but poses challenges in visibility and access, making accurate 3D reconstruction a significant tool in surgical planning and navigation.This work introduces a robotic arm platform for efficient multi-view image acquisition and precise 3D reconstruction in MIS settings.We adapted a laparoscope to a robotic arm and captured ex-vivo images of several ovine organs across varying lighting conditions (operating room and laparoscopic) and trajectories (spherical and laparoscopic).We employed recently released learning-based feature matchers combined with COLMAP to produce our reconstructions.The reconstructions were evaluated against high-precision laser scans for quantitative evaluation.Our results show that whilst reconstructions suffer most under realistic MIS lighting and trajectory, many versions of our pipeline achieve close to sub-millimetre accuracy with an average of 1.05 mm Root Mean Squared Error and 0.82 mm Chamfer distance.Our best reconstruction results occur with operating room lighting and spherical trajectories.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our robotic platform provides a tool for controlled, repeatable multi-view data acquisition for 3D generation in MIS environments which we hope leads to new datasets for training learning-based models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.723</span></span></p>

                  <p>The conventional paradigm of using large language models (LLMs) for evaluating natural language generation (NLG) systems typically relies on two key inputs: (1) a clear definition of the NLG task to be evaluated and (2) a list of pre-defined evaluation criteria.This process treats LLMs as ''passive critics,'' strictly following human-defined criteria for evaluation.However, as new NLG tasks emerge, the criteria for assessing text quality can vary greatly.Consequently, these rigid evaluation methods struggle to adapt to diverse NLG tasks without extensive prompt engineering customized for each specific task.To address this limitation, we introduce Active-Critic, a novel LLM-based NLG evaluation protocol that enables LLMs to function as ''active critics.''Specifically, our protocol comprises two key stages.In the first stage, the LLM is instructed to infer the target NLG task and establish relevant evaluation criteria from the data.Building on this self-inferred information, the second stage dynamically optimizes the prompt to guide the LLM toward more human-aligned scoring decisions, while also generating detailed explanations to justify its evaluations.Experiments across four NLG evaluation tasks show that our approach achieves stronger alignment with human judgments than state-of-the-art evaluation methods.Our comprehensive analysis further highlights the effectiveness and explainability of Active-Critic with only a small amount of labeled data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We will share our code and data on GitHub. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.767</span></span></p>

                  <p>Preference alignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly improved their ability to adhere to human instructions and intentions.However, existing direct alignment algorithms primarily focus on relative preferences and often overlook the qualitative aspects of responses.Striving to maximize the implicit reward gap between the chosen and the slightly inferior rejected responses can cause overfitting and unnecessary unlearning of the high-quality rejected responses.The unawareness of the reward scores also drives the LLM to indiscriminately favor the low-quality chosen responses and fail to generalize to responses with the highest rewards, which are sparse in data.To overcome these shortcomings, our study introduces reward-conditioned LLM policies that discern and learn from the entire spectrum of response quality within the dataset, helping extrapolate to more optimal regions.We propose an effective yet simple data relabeling method that conditions the preference pairs on quality scores to construct a reward-augmented dataset.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This dataset is easily integrated with existing direct alignment algorithms and is applicable to any preference dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.761</span></span>The experimental results across instruction-following benchmarks including AlpacaEval, MT-Bench, and Arena-Hard-Auto demonstrate that our approach consistently boosts the performance of DPO by a considerable margin across diverse models.Additionally, our method improves the average accuracy on various academic benchmarks.When applying our method to on-policy data, the resulting DPO model achieves SOTA results on AlpacaEval.Through ablation studies, we demonstrate that our method not only maximizes the utility of preference data but also mitigates the issue of unlearning, demonstrating its broad effectiveness beyond mere dataset expansion.Our code is available at https://github.com/shenao-zhang/reward-augmented-preference.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Model (LLM)-based generative recommendation has achieved notable success, yet its practical deployment is costly particularly due to excessive inference latency caused by autoregressive decoding.For lossless LLM decoding acceleration, Speculative Decoding (SD) has emerged as a promising solution.However, applying SD to generative recommendation presents unique challenges due to the requirement of generating top-K items (i.e., K distinct token sequences) as a recommendation list by beam search.This leads to more stringent verification in SD, where all the top-K sequences from the target LLM must be successfully drafted by the draft model at each decoding step.To alleviate this, we consider 1) boosting top-K sequence alignment between the draft model and the target LLM, and 2) relaxing the verification strategy to reduce trivial LLM calls.To this end, we propose an alignment framework named AtSpeed, which presents the AtSpeed-S optimization objective for top-K alignment under the strict top-K verification.Moreover, we introduce a relaxed sampling verification strategy that allows high-probability non-top-K drafted sequences to be accepted, significantly reducing LLM calls.Correspondingly, we propose AtSpeed-R for top-K alignment under this relaxed sampling verification.Empirical results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that AtSpeed significantly accelerates LLM-based generative recommendation, e.g., near 2x speedup under strict top-K verification and up to 2.5 speedup under relaxed sampling verification.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The codes and datasets will be released in the near future. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.847</span></span></p>

                  <p>The visual detection and tracking of surface terrain is required for spacecraft to safely land on or navigate within close proximity to celestial objects.Current approaches rely on template matching with pre-gathered patch-based features, which are expensive to obtain and a limiting factor in perceptual capability.While recent literature has focused on in-situ detection methods to enhance navigation and operational autonomy, robust description is still needed.In this work, we explore metric learning as the lightweight feature description mechanism and find that current solutions fail to address inter-class similarity and multi-view observational geometry.We attribute this to the view-unaware attention mechanism and introduce Multi-view Attention Regularizations (MARs) to constrain the channel and spatial attention across multiple feature views, regularizing the what and where of attention focus.We thoroughly analyze many modern metric learning losses with and without MARs and demonstrate improved terrain-feature recognition performance by upwards of 85%.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We additionally introduce the Luna-1 dataset, consisting of Moon crater landmarks and reference navigation frames from NASA mission data to support future research in this difficult task. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.902</span></span>Luna-1 and source code are publicly available at https://droneslab.github.io/mars/.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) often produce errors, including factual inaccuracies, biases, and reasoning failures, collectively referred to as "hallucinations".Recent studies have demonstrated that LLMs' internal states encode information regarding the truthfulness of their outputs, and that this information can be utilized to detect errors.In this work, we show that the internal representations of LLMs encode much more information about truthfulness than previously recognized.We first discover that the truthfulness information is concentrated in specific tokens, and leveraging this property significantly enhances error detection performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Yet, we show that such error detectors fail to generalize across datasets, implying that -- contrary to prior claims -- truthfulness encoding is not universal but rather multifaceted. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.61</span></span>Next, we show that internal representations can also be used for predicting the types of errors the model is likely to make, facilitating the development of tailored mitigation strategies.Lastly, we reveal a discrepancy between LLMs' internal encoding and external behavior: they may encode the correct answer, yet consistently generate an incorrect one.Taken together, these insights deepen our understanding of LLM errors from the model's internal perspective, which can guide future research on enhancing error analysis and mitigation.</p>

                  <p>The various limitations of Generative AI, such as hallucinations and model failures, have made it crucial to understand the role of different modalities in Visual Language Model (VLM) predictions.Our work investigates how the integration of information from image and text modalities influences the performance and behavior of VLMs in visual question answering (VQA) and reasoning tasks.We measure this effect through answer accuracy, reasoning quality, model uncertainty, and modality relevance.We study the interplay between text and image modalities in different configurations where visual content is essential for solving the VQA task.Our contributions include (1) the Semantic Interventions (SI)-VQA dataset, (2) a benchmark study of various VLM architectures under different modality configurations, and (3) the Interactive Semantic Interventions (ISI) tool.The SI-VQA dataset serves as the foundation for the benchmark, while the ISI tool provides an interface to test and apply semantic interventions in image and text inputs, enabling more fine-grained analysis.Our results show that complementary information between modalities improves answer and reasoning quality, while contradictory information harms model performance and confidence.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Image text annotations have minimal impact on accuracy and uncertainty, slightly increasing image relevance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span>Attention analysis confirms the dominant role of image inputs over text in VQA tasks.In this study, we evaluate state-of-the-art VLMs that allow us to extract attention coefficients for each modality.A key finding is PaliGemma's harmful overconfidence, which poses a higher risk of silent failures compared to the LLaVA models.This work sets the foundation for rigorous analysis of modality integration, supported by datasets specifically designed for this purpose.</p>

To enhance system efficiency, we implement a workload estimator and design an OP-Fence scheduler to cluster devices with similar bandwidths together and partition the DAG to increase throughput.Additionally, we propose an AdaTopK compressor to adaptively compress intermediate activations and gradients at the slowest communication links.To evaluate the convergence and efficiency of our system and algorithms, we train ResNet-101 and GPT-2 on three real-world testbeds using 48 GPUs connected with 8 Mbps~10 Gbps networks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results demonstrate that our system and method can achieve 1.45 - 9.39x speedup compared to baseline methods while ensuring convergence. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.763</span></span></p>

                  <p>The emergence of Segment Anything (SAM) sparked research interest in the field of interactive segmentation, especially in the context of image editing tasks and speeding up data annotation.Unlike common semantic segmentation, interactive segmentation methods allow users to directly influence their output through prompts (e.g. clicks).However, click patterns in real-world interactive segmentation scenarios remain largely unexplored.Most methods rely on the assumption that users would click in the center of the largest erroneous area.Nevertheless, recent studies show that this is not always the case.Thus, methods may have poor performance in real-world deployment despite high metrics in a baseline benchmark.To accurately simulate real-user clicks, we conducted a large crowdsourcing study of click patterns in an interactive segmentation scenario and collected 475K real-user clicks.Drawing on ideas from saliency tasks, we develop a clickability model that enables sampling clicks, which closely resemble actual user inputs.Using our model and dataset, we propose RClicks benchmark for a comprehensive comparison of existing interactive segmentation methods on realistic clicks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, we evaluate not only the average quality of methods, but also the robustness w.r.t. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.663</span></span>click patterns.According to our benchmark, in real-world usage interactive segmentation models may perform worse than it has been reported in the baseline benchmark, and most of the methods are not robust.We believe that RClicks is a significant step towards creating interactive segmentation methods that provide the best user experience in real-world cases.</p>

                  <p>While speculative decoding has recently appeared as a promising direction for accelerating the inference of large language models (LLMs), the speedup and scalability are strongly bounded by the token acceptance rate.Prevalent methods usually organize predicted tokens as independent chains or fixed token trees, which fails to generalize to diverse query distributions.In this paper, we propose DySpec, a faster speculative decoding algorithm with a novel dynamic token tree structure.We begin by bridging the draft distribution and acceptance rate from intuitive and empirical clues, and successfully show that the two variables are strongly correlated.Based on this, we employ a greedy strategy to dynamically expand the token tree at run time.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Theoretically, we show that our method can achieve optimal results under mild assumptions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.648</span></span>Empirically, DySpec yields a higher acceptance rate and speedup than fixed trees.DySpec can drastically improve the throughput and reduce the latency of token generation across various data distribution and model sizes, which significantly outperforms strong competitors, including Specinfer and Sequoia.Under low temperature setting, DySpec can improve the throughput up to 9.1$\times$ and reduce the latency up to 9.4$\times$ on Llama2-70B.

                  <p>Many real-world applications of tabular data involve using historic events to predict properties of new ones, for example whether a credit card transaction is fraudulent or what rating a customer will assign a product on a retail platform.Existing approaches to event prediction include costly, brittle, and application-dependent techniques such as time-aware positional embeddings, learned row and field encodings, and oversampling methods for addressing class imbalance.Moreover, these approaches often assume specific use-cases, for example that we know the labels of all historic events or that we only predict a pre-specified label and not the data's features themselves.In this work, we propose a simple but flexible baseline using standard autoregressive LLM-style transformers with elementary positional embeddings and a causal language modeling objective.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our baseline outperforms existing approaches across popular datasets and can be employed for various use-cases. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.626</span></span>We demonstrate that the same model can predict labels, impute missing values, or model event sequences.</p>

                  <p>As large language models (LLMs) continue to evolve, efficient evaluation metrics are vital for assessing their ability to compress information and reduce redundancy.While traditional metrics like Matrix Entropy offer valuable insights, they are computationally intensive for large-scale models due to their \( O(n^3) \) time complexity with Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).To mitigate this issue, we introduce the Matrix Nuclear-Norm, which not only serves as a metric to quantify the data compression proficiency of LLM but also provides a convex approximation of matrix rank to capture both predictive discriminability and diversity.By employing the \( L_{1,2}\text{-norm} \) to further approximate the nuclear norm, we can effectively assess the model's information compression capabilities.This approach reduces the time complexity to \( O(n^2) \) and eliminates the need for SVD computation.Consequently, the Matrix Nuclear-Norm achieves speeds 8 to 24 times faster than Matrix Entropy for the CEREBRAS-GPT model as sizes increase from 111M to 6.7B.This performance gap becomes more pronounced with larger models, as validated in tests with other models like Pythia.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, evaluations on benchmarks and model responses confirm that our proposed Matrix Nuclear-Norm is a reliable, scalable, and efficient tool for assessing LLMs' performance, striking a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span>The code is available at https://github.com/MLGroupJLU/MatrixNuclearNorm.</p>

                  <p>Weight space learning aims to extract information about a neural network, such as its training dataset or generalization error.Recent approaches learn directly from model weights, but this presents many challenges as weights are high-dimensional and include permutation symmetries between neurons.An alternative approach, Probing, represents a model by passing a set of learned inputs (probes) through the model, and training a predictor on top of the corresponding outputs.Although probing is typically not used as a stand alone approach, our preliminary experiment found that a vanilla probing baseline worked surprisingly well.However, we discover that current probe learning strategies are ineffective.We therefore propose Deep Linear Probe Generators (ProbeGen), a simple and effective modification to probing approaches.ProbeGen adds a shared generator module with a deep linear architecture, providing an inductive bias towards structured probes thus reducing overfitting.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While simple, ProbeGen performs significantly better than the state-of-the-art and is very efficient, requiring between 30 to 1000 times fewer FLOPs than other top approaches. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.659</span></span></p>

                  <p>Packing, initially utilized in the pre-training phase, is an optimization technique designed to maximize hardware resource efficiency by combining different training sequences to fit the model's maximum input length.Although it has demonstrated effectiveness during pre-training, there remains a lack of comprehensive analysis for the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage on the following points: (1) whether packing can effectively enhance training efficiency while maintaining performance, (2) the suitable size of the model and dataset for fine-tuning with the packing method, and (3) whether packing unrelated or related training samples might cause the model to either excessively disregard or over-rely on the context.   In this paper, we perform extensive comparisons between SFT methods using padding and packing, covering SFT datasets ranging from 69K to 1.2M and models from 8B to 70B.This provides the first comprehensive analysis of the advantages and limitations of packing versus padding, as well as practical considerations for implementing packing in various training scenarios.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our analysis covers various benchmarks, including knowledge, reasoning, and coding, as well as GPT-based evaluations, time efficiency, and other fine-tuning parameters. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.623</span></span>We also open-source our code for fine-tuning and evaluation and provide checkpoints fine-tuned on datasets of different sizes, aiming to advance future research on packing methods.Code is available at: https://github.com/ShuheWang1998/Packing-Analysis?tab=readme-ov-file.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive capabilities but require careful alignment with human preferences.Traditional training-time methods finetune LLMs using human preference datasets but incur significant training costs and require repeated training to handle diverse user preferences.Test-time alignment methods address this by using reward models (RMs) to guide frozen LLMs without retraining.However, existing test-time approaches rely on trajectory-level RMs which are designed to evaluate complete responses, making them unsuitable for autoregressive text generation that requires computing next-token rewards from partial responses.To address this, we introduce GenARM, a test-time alignment approach that leverages the Autoregressive Reward Model--a novel reward parametrization designed to predict next-token rewards for efficient and effective autoregressive generation.Theoretically, we demonstrate that this parametrization can provably guide frozen LLMs toward any distribution achievable by traditional RMs within the KL-regularized reinforcement learning framework.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results show that GenARM significantly outperforms prior test-time alignment baselines and matches the performance of training-time methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.626</span></span>Additionally, GenARM enables efficient weak-to-strong guidance, aligning larger LLMs with smaller RMs without the high costs of training larger models.Furthermore, GenARM supports multi-objective alignment, allowing real-time trade-offs between preference dimensions and catering to diverse user preferences without retraining.</p>

                  <p>The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to an influx of efforts to extend their capabilities to multimodal tasks.Among them, growing attention has been focused on monolithic Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that integrate visual encoding and language decoding into a single LLM.Despite the structural simplicity and deployment-friendliness, training a monolithic MLLM with promising performance still remains challenging.In particular, the popular approaches adopt continuous pre-training to extend a pre-trained LLM to a monolithic MLLM, which suffers from catastrophic forgetting and leads to performance degeneration.In this paper, we aim to overcome this limitation from the perspective of delta tuning.Specifically, our core idea is to embed visual parameters into a pre-trained LLM, thereby incrementally learning visual knowledge from massive data via delta tuning, i.e., freezing the LLM when optimizing the visual parameters.Based on this principle, we present Mono-InternVL, a novel monolithic MLLM that seamlessly integrates a set of visual experts via a multimodal mixture-of-experts structure.Moreover, we propose an innovative pre-training strategy to maximize the visual capability of Mono-InternVL, namely Endogenous Visual Pre-training (EViP).In particular, EViP is designed as a progressive learning process for visual experts, which aims to fully exploit the visual knowledge from noisy data to high-quality data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To validate our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on 16 benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.739</span></span>Experimental results not only validate the superior performance of Mono-InternVL compared to the state-of-the-art MLLM on 6 multimodal benchmarks, e.g., +113 points over InternVL-1.5 on OCRBench, but also confirm its better deployment efficiency, with first token latency reduced by up to 67%.</p>
