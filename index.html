                  <p>Objective: We aim to investigate long-term robotic surgical skill acquisition among surgical residents and the effects of training intervals and fatigue on performance.Methods: For six months, surgical residents participated in three training sessions once a month, surrounding a single 26-hour hospital shift.In each shift, they participated in training sessions scheduled before, during, and after the shift.In each training session, they performed three dry-lab training tasks: Ring Tower Transfer, Knot-Tying, and Suturing.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We collected a comprehensive dataset, including videos synchronized with kinematic data, activity tracking, and scans of the suturing pads. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.84</span></span>Results:We collected a dataset of 972 trials performed by 18 residents of different surgical specializations.Participants demonstrated consistent performance improvement across all tasks.In addition, we found variations in between-shift learning and forgetting across metrics and tasks, and hints for possible effects of fatigue.Conclusion: The findings from our first analysis shed light on the long-term learning processes of robotic surgical skills with extended intervals and varying levels of fatigue.Significance: This study lays the groundwork for future research aimed at optimizing training protocols and enhancing AI applications in surgery, ultimately contributing to improved patient outcomes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset will be made available upon acceptance of our journal submission. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.938</span></span></p>

                  <p>The recent DeepSeek-R1 has showcased the emergence of reasoning capabilities in LLMs through reinforcement learning (RL) with rule-based rewards.Building on this idea, we are the first to explore how rule-based RL can enhance the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for graphic user interface (GUI) action prediction tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To this end, we curate a small yet high-quality dataset of 136 challenging tasks, encompassing five common action types on mobile devices. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.74</span></span>We also introduce a unified rule-based action reward, enabling model optimization via policy-based algorithms such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO).Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed data-efficient model, UI-R1-3B, achieves substantial improvements on both in-domain (ID) and out-of-domain (OOD) tasks.Specifically, on the ID benchmark AndroidControl, the action type accuracy improves by 15%, while grounding accuracy increases by 10.3%, compared with the base model (i.e. Qwen2.5-VL-3B).On the OOD GUI grounding benchmark ScreenSpot-Pro, our model surpasses the base model by 6.0% and achieves competitive performance with larger models (e.g., OS-Atlas-7B), which are trained via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on 76K data.These results underscore the potential of rule-based reinforcement learning to advance GUI understanding and control, paving the way for future research in this domain.</p>

                  <p>This paper introduces JiraiBench, the first bilingual benchmark for evaluating large language models' effectiveness in detecting self-destructive content across Chinese and Japanese social media communities.Focusing on the transnational "Jirai" (landmine) online subculture that encompasses multiple forms of self-destructive behaviors including drug overdose, eating disorders, and self-harm, we present a comprehensive evaluation framework incorporating both linguistic and cultural dimensions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our dataset comprises 10,419 Chinese posts and 5,000 Japanese posts with multidimensional annotation along three behavioral categories, achieving substantial inter-annotator agreement. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.842</span></span>Experimental evaluations across four state-of-the-art models reveal significant performance variations based on instructional language, with Japanese prompts unexpectedly outperforming Chinese prompts when processing Chinese content.This emergent cross-cultural transfer suggests that cultural proximity can sometimes outweigh linguistic similarity in detection tasks.Cross-lingual transfer experiments with fine-tuned models further demonstrate the potential for knowledge transfer between these language systems without explicit target language training.These findings highlight the need for culturally-informed approaches to multilingual content moderation and provide empirical evidence for the importance of cultural context in developing more effective detection systems for vulnerable online communities.</p>

                  <p>Role-playing games (RPG) are games in which players interact with one another to create narratives.The role of players in the RPG is largely based on the interaction between players and their characters.This emerging form of shared narrative, primarily oral, is receiving increasing attention.In particular, many authors investigated the use of an LLM as an actor in the game.In this paper, we aim to discover to what extent the language of Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit oral or written features when asked to generate an RPG session without human interference.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We will conduct a linguistic analysis of the lexical and syntactic features of the generated texts and compare the results with analyses of conversations, transcripts of human RPG sessions, and books. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.789</span></span>We found that LLMs exhibit a pattern that is distinct from all other text categories, including oral conversations, human RPG sessions and books.Our analysis has shown how training influences the way LLMs express themselves and provides important indications of the narrative capabilities of these tools.</p>

                  <p>The rapid development of multimodal large language models has resulted in remarkable advancements in visual perception and understanding, consolidating several tasks into a single visual question-answering framework.However, these models are prone to hallucinations, which limit their reliability as artificial intelligence systems.While this issue is extensively researched in natural language processing and image captioning, there remains a lack of investigation of hallucinations in Low-level Visual Perception and Understanding (HLPU), especially in the context of image quality assessment tasks.We consider that these hallucinations arise from an absence of clear self-awareness within the models.To address this issue, we first introduce the HLPU instruction database, the first instruction database specifically focused on hallucinations in low-level vision tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This database contains approximately 200K question-answer pairs and comprises four subsets, each covering different types of instructions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.82</span></span>Subsequently, we propose the Self-Awareness Failure Elimination (SAFEQA) model, which utilizes image features, salient region features and quality features to improve the perception and comprehension abilities of the model in low-level vision tasks.Furthermore, we propose the Enhancing Self-Awareness Preference Optimization (ESA-PO) framework to increase the model's awareness of knowledge boundaries, thereby mitigating the incidence of hallucination.Finally, we conduct comprehensive experiments on low-level vision tasks, with the results demonstrating that our proposed method significantly enhances self-awareness of the model in these tasks and reduces hallucinations.Notably, our proposed method improves both accuracy and self-awareness of the proposed model and outperforms close-source models in terms of various evaluation metrics.</p>

                  <p>In this paper, we explore the task of generating expansive outdoor scenes, ranging from castles to high-rises.Unlike indoor scene generation, which has been a primary focus of prior work, outdoor scene generation presents unique challenges, including wide variations in scene heights and the need for a method capable of rapidly producing large landscapes.To address this, we propose an efficient approach that encodes scene chunks as uniform vector sets, offering better compression and performance than the spatially structured latents used in prior methods.Furthermore, we train an explicit outpainting model for unbounded generation, which improves coherence compared to prior resampling-based inpainting schemes while also speeding up generation by eliminating extra diffusion steps.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To facilitate this task, we curate NuiScene43, a small but high-quality set of scenes, preprocessed for joint training. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.811</span></span>Notably, when trained on scenes of varying styles, our model can blend different environments, such as rural houses and city skyscrapers, within the same scene, highlighting the potential of our curation process to leverage heterogeneous scenes for joint training.</p>

                  <p>Repository-level code completion aims to complete code based on the long contexts of the repository.Existing studies extract long contexts from the repository as inputs and leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate code.However, we reveal a severe limitation of LLMs, i.e., LLMs may ignore the information within long contexts in code completion.In other words, even the contexts contain useful information (e.g., relevant APIs or similar code), LLMs may fail to utilize this information.We think this limitation is caused by an inherent bias in LLMs, i.e., relying on nearby contexts and ignoring long-range contexts.To address this, we propose a novel fine-tuning approach named CoLT.The core idea of CoLT is to provide explicit supervision signals, which emphasize that long-range contexts may hold relevant information.Specifically, CoLT proposes a reinforcement learning-based training, which explicitly encourages models to utilize the information within long contexts and punishes models for ignoring long contexts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To support CoLT, we release CoLT-132K, a large-scale dataset with 132k samples across four languages, each containing long-context inputs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.932</span></span>We apply CoLT to a popular LLM - aiXcoder-7B and release aiXcoder-7B-v2.We conduct extensive experiments on CoLT-132K and a public benchmark - CrossCodeEval.Our experiments yield the results: 1.Effectiveness.CoLT substantially improves aiXcoder-7B. aiXcoder-7B-v2 outperforms aiXcoder-7B by up to 44% in exact match.aiXcoder-7B-v2 becomes the state-of-the-art 7B model in code completion and even surpasses larger models.2.

                  <p>We introduce Visual Persona, a foundation model for text-to-image full-body human customization that, given a single in-the-wild human image, generates diverse images of the individual guided by text descriptions.Unlike prior methods that focus solely on preserving facial identity, our approach captures detailed full-body appearance, aligning with text descriptions for body structure and scene variations.Training this model requires large-scale paired human data, consisting of multiple images per individual with consistent full-body identities, which is notoriously difficult to obtain.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this, we propose a data curation pipeline leveraging vision-language models to evaluate full-body appearance consistency, resulting in Visual Persona-500K, a dataset of 580k paired human images across 100k unique identities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.715</span></span>For precise appearance transfer, we introduce a transformer encoder-decoder architecture adapted to a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model, which augments the input image into distinct body regions, encodes these regions as local appearance features, and projects them into dense identity embeddings independently to condition the diffusion model for synthesizing customized images.Visual Persona consistently surpasses existing approaches, generating high-quality, customized images from in-the-wild inputs.Extensive ablation studies validate design choices, and we demonstrate the versatility of Visual Persona across various downstream tasks.</p>

                  <p>Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at various image-related tasks, they encounter challenges in precisely aligning coordinates with spatial information within images, particularly in position-aware tasks such as visual grounding.This limitation arises from two key factors.First, MLLMs lack explicit spatial references, making it difficult to associate textual descriptions with precise image locations.Second, their feature extraction processes prioritize global context over fine-grained spatial details, leading to weak localization capability.To address this issue, we introduce VPP-LLaVA, an MLLM equipped with Visual Position Prompt (VPP) to improve its grounding capability.VPP-LLaVA integrates two complementary mechanisms.The global VPP overlays learnable, axis-like embeddings onto the input image to provide structured spatial cues.The local VPP focuses on fine-grained localization by incorporating position-aware queries, which suggests probable object locations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also introduce a VPP-SFT dataset with 0.6M samples, consolidating high-quality visual grounding data into a compact format for efficient model training. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.754</span></span>Training on this dataset with VPP enhances the model's performance, achieving state-of-the-art results on standard grounding benchmarks despite using fewer training samples compared to other MLLMs like MiniGPT-v2, which rely on much larger datasets ($\sim$21M samples).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code and VPP-SFT dataset will be available at https://github.com/WayneTomas/VPP-LLaVA upon acceptance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.766</span></span></p>

                  <p>We address the problem of cluster identity estimation in a personalized federated learning (PFL) setting in which users aim to learn different personal models.The backbone of effective learning in such a setting is to cluster users into groups whose objectives are similar.A typical approach in the literature is to achieve this by training users' data on different proposed personal models and assign them to groups based on which model achieves the lowest value of the users' loss functions.This process is to be done iteratively until group identities converge.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A key challenge in such a setting arises when users have noisy labeled data, which may produce misleading values of their loss functions, and hence lead to ineffective clustering. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.635</span></span>To overcome this challenge, we propose a label-agnostic data similarity-based clustering algorithm, coined RCC-PFL, with three main advantages: the cluster identity estimation procedure is independent from the training labels; it is a one-shot clustering algorithm performed prior to the training; and it requires fewer communication rounds and less computation compared to iterative-based clustering methods.We validate our proposed algorithm using various models and datasets and show that it outperforms multiple baselines in terms of average accuracy and variance reduction.</p>

                  <p>Semi-supervised learning utilizes insights from unlabeled data to improve model generalization, thereby reducing reliance on large labeled datasets.Most existing studies focus on limited samples and fail to capture the overall data distribution.We contend that combining distributional information with detailed information is crucial for achieving more robust and accurate segmentation results.On the one hand, with its robust generative capabilities, diffusion models (DM) learn data distribution effectively.However, it struggles with fine detail capture, leading to generated images with misleading details.Combining DM with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) enables the former to learn data distribution while the latter corrects fine details.While capturing complete high-frequency details by CNNs requires substantial computational resources and is susceptible to local noise.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>On the other hand, given that both labeled and unlabeled data come from the same distribution, we believe that regions in unlabeled data similar to overall class semantics to labeled data are likely to belong to the same class, while regions with minimal similarity are less likely to. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.622</span></span>This work introduces a semi-supervised medical image segmentation framework from the distribution perspective (Diff-CL).Firstly, we propose a cross-pseudo-supervision learning mechanism between diffusion and convolution segmentation networks.Secondly, we design a high-frequency mamba module to capture boundary and detail information globally.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we apply contrastive learning for label propagation from labeled to unlabeled data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.653</span></span>Our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across three datasets, including left atrium, brain tumor, and NIH pancreas datasets.</p>

                  <p>Evaluating text-to-image synthesis is challenging due to misalignment between established metrics and human preferences.We propose cFreD, a metric based on the notion of Conditional Fr\'echet Distance that explicitly accounts for both visual fidelity and text-prompt alignment.Existing metrics such as Inception Score (IS), Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) and CLIPScore assess either image quality or image-text alignment but not both which limits their correlation with human preferences.Scoring models explicitly trained to replicate human preferences require constant updates and may not generalize to novel generation techniques or out-of-domain inputs.Through extensive experiments across multiple recently proposed text-to-image models and diverse prompt datasets, we demonstrate that cFreD exhibits a higher correlation with human judgments compared to statistical metrics, including metrics trained with human preferences.Our findings validate cFreD as a robust, future-proof metric for the systematic evaluation of text-to-image models, standardizing benchmarking in this rapidly evolving field.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We release our evaluation toolkit and benchmark in the appendix. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span></p>

                  <p>Ensuring the reliability and effectiveness of software release decisions is critical, particularly in safety-critical domains like automotive systems.Precise analysis of release validation data, often presented in tabular form, plays a pivotal role in this process.However, traditional methods that rely on manual analysis of extensive test datasets and validation metrics are prone to delays and high costs.Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative but face challenges in analytical reasoning, contextual understanding, handling out-of-scope queries, and processing structured test data consistently; limitations that hinder their direct application in safety-critical scenarios.This paper introduces GateLens, an LLM-based tool for analyzing tabular data in the automotive domain.GateLens translates natural language queries into Relational Algebra (RA) expressions and then generates optimized Python code.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It outperforms the baseline system on benchmarking datasets, achieving higher F1 scores and handling complex and ambiguous queries with greater robustness. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span>Ablation studies confirm the critical role of the RA module, with performance dropping sharply when omitted.Industrial evaluations reveal that GateLens reduces analysis time by over 80% while maintaining high accuracy and reliability.As demonstrated by presented results, GateLens achieved high performance without relying on few-shot examples, showcasing strong generalization across various query types from diverse company roles.Insights from deploying GateLens with a partner automotive company offer practical guidance for integrating AI into critical workflows such as release validation.Results show that by automating test result analysis, GateLens enables faster, more informed, and dependable release decisions, and can thus advance software scalability and reliability in automotive systems.</p>

                  <p>Recent pre-trained vision-language models (PT-VLMs) often face a Multi-Domain Class-Incremental Learning (MCIL) scenario in practice, where several classes and domains of multi-modal tasks are incrementally arrived.Without access to previously learned tasks and unseen tasks, memory-constrained MCIL suffers from forward and backward forgetting.To alleviate the above challenges, parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques (PEFT), such as prompt tuning, are employed to adapt the PT-VLM to the diverse incrementally learned tasks.To achieve effective new task adaptation, existing methods only consider the effect of PEFT strategy selection, but neglect the influence of PEFT parameter setting (e.g., prompting).In this paper, we tackle the challenge of optimizing prompt designs for diverse tasks in MCIL and propose an Instance-Aware Prompting (IAP) framework.Specifically, our Instance-Aware Gated Prompting (IA-GP) module enhances adaptation to new tasks while mitigating forgetting by dynamically assigning prompts across transformer layers at the instance level.Our Instance-Aware Class-Distribution-Driven Prompting (IA-CDDP) improves the task adaptation process by determining an accurate task-label-related confidence score for each instance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental evaluations across 11 datasets, using three performance metrics, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.696</span></span>Code can be found at https://github.com/FerdinandZJU/IAP.</p>

                  <p>Recently, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as a promising approach for robotic control.However, the deployment of DRL in real-world robots is hindered by its sensitivity to environmental perturbations.While existing whitebox adversarial attacks rely on local gradient information and apply uniform perturbations across all states to evaluate DRL robustness, they fail to account for temporal dynamics and state-specific vulnerabilities.To combat the above challenge, we first conduct a theoretical analysis of white-box attacks in DRL by establishing the adversarial victim-dynamics Markov decision process (AVD-MDP), to derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for a successful attack.Based on this, we propose a selective state-aware reinforcement adversarial attack method, named STAR, to optimize perturbation stealthiness and state visitation dispersion.STAR first employs a soft mask-based state-targeting mechanism to minimize redundant perturbations, enhancing stealthiness and attack effectiveness.Then, it incorporates an information-theoretic optimization objective to maximize mutual information between perturbations, environmental states, and victim actions, ensuring a dispersed state-visitation distribution that steers the victim agent into vulnerable states for maximum return reduction.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments demonstrate that STAR outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.665</span></span></p>

                  <p>The successes achieved by deep neural networks in computer vision tasks have led in recent years to the emergence of a new research area dubbed Multi-Dimensional Encoding (MDE).Methods belonging to this family aim to transform tabular data into a homogeneous form of discrete digital signals (images) to apply convolutional networks to initially unsuitable problems.Despite the successive emerging works, the pool of multi-dimensional encoding methods is still low, and the scope of research on existing modality encoding techniques is quite limited.To contribute to this area of research, we propose the Radar-based Encoding from Tabular to Image REpresentation (RETIRE), which allows tabular data to be represented as radar graphs, capturing the feature characteristics of each problem instance.RETIRE was compared with a pool of state-of-the-art MDE algorithms as well as with XGBoost in terms of classification accuracy and computational complexity.In addition, an analysis was carried out regarding transferability and explainability to provide more insight into both RETIRE and existing MDE techniques.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results obtained, supported by statistical analysis, confirm the superiority of RETIRE over other established MDE methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.685</span></span></p>

                  <p>Image generation technology has brought significant advancements across various fields but has also raised concerns about data misuse and potential rights infringements, particularly with respect to creating visual artworks.Current methods aimed at safeguarding artworks often employ adversarial attacks.However, these methods face challenges such as poor transferability, high computational costs, and the introduction of noticeable noise, which compromises the aesthetic quality of the original artwork.To address these limitations, we propose a Structurally Imperceptible and Transferable Adversarial (SITA) attacks.SITA leverages a CLIP-based destylization loss, which decouples and disrupts the robust style representation of the image.This disruption hinders style extraction during stylized image generation, thereby impairing the overall stylization process.Importantly, SITA eliminates the need for a surrogate diffusion model, leading to significantly reduced computational overhead.The method's robust style feature disruption ensures high transferability across diverse models.Moreover, SITA introduces perturbations by embedding noise within the imperceptible structural details of the image.This approach effectively protects against style extraction without compromising the visual quality of the artwork.Extensive experiments demonstrate that SITA offers superior protection for artworks against unauthorized use in stylized generation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of transferability, computational efficiency, and noise imperceptibility. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.654</span></span>Code is available at https://github.com/A-raniy-day/SITA.</p>

                  <p>We address the problem of cluster identity estimation in a personalized federated learning (PFL) setting in which users aim to learn different personal models.The backbone of effective learning in such a setting is to cluster users into groups whose objectives are similar.A typical approach in the literature is to achieve this by training users' data on different proposed personal models and assign them to groups based on which model achieves the lowest value of the users' loss functions.This process is to be done iteratively until group identities converge.A key challenge in such a setting arises when users have noisy labeled data, which may produce misleading values of their loss functions, and hence lead to ineffective clustering.To overcome this challenge, we propose a label-agnostic data similarity-based clustering algorithm, coined RCC-PFL, with three main advantages: the cluster identity estimation procedure is independent from the training labels; it is a one-shot clustering algorithm performed prior to the training; and it requires fewer communication rounds and less computation compared to iterative-based clustering methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We validate our proposed algorithm using various models and datasets and show that it outperforms multiple baselines in terms of average accuracy and variance reduction. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.763</span></span></p>

                  <p>Gait recognition is emerging as a promising and innovative area within the field of computer vision, widely applied to remote person identification.Although existing gait recognition methods have achieved substantial success in controlled laboratory datasets, their performance often declines significantly when transitioning to wild datasets.We argue that the performance gap can be primarily attributed to the spatio-temporal distribution inconsistencies present in wild datasets, where subjects appear at varying angles, positions, and distances across the frames.To achieve accurate gait recognition in the wild, we propose a skeleton-guided silhouette alignment strategy, which uses prior knowledge of the skeletons to perform affine transformations on the corresponding silhouettes.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the impact of data alignment on gait recognition.We conducted extensive experiments across multiple datasets and network architectures, and the results demonstrate the significant advantages of our proposed alignment strategy.Specifically, on the challenging Gait3D dataset, our method achieved an average performance improvement of 7.9% across all evaluated networks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, our method achieves substantial improvements on cross-domain datasets, with accuracy improvements of up to 24.0%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.627</span></span></p>

                  <p>In this work, we aim to compress the vision tokens of a Large Vision Language Model (LVLM) into a representation that is simultaneously suitable for (a) generative and (b) discriminative tasks, (c) is nearly lossless, and (d) is storage-efficient.We propose a novel compression approach, called Fwd2Bot, that uses the LVLM itself to compress the visual information in a task-agnostic manner.At the core of Fwd2bot there exists a "double-forward pass" training strategy, whereby, during the first forward pass, the LLM (of the LVLM) creates a bottleneck by condensing the visual information into a small number of summary tokens.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Then, using the same LLM, the second forward pass processes the language instruction(s) alongside the summary tokens, used as a direct replacement for the image ones. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.699</span></span>The training signal is provided by two losses: an autoregressive one applied after the second pass that provides a direct optimization objective for compression, and a contrastive loss, applied after the first pass, that further boosts the representation strength, especially for discriminative tasks.The training is further enhanced by stage-specific adapters.We accompany the proposed method by an in-depth ablation study.Overall, Fwd2Bot results in highly-informative compressed representations suitable for both generative and discriminative tasks.For generative tasks, we offer a 2x higher compression rate without compromising the generative capabilities, setting a new state-of-the-art result.For discriminative tasks, we set a new state-of-the-art on image retrieval and compositionality.</p>

                  <p>True-time-delay (TTD) beamformers can produce wideband, squint-free beams in both analog and digital signal domains, unlike frequency-dependent FFT beams.Our previous work showed that TTD beamformers can be efficiently realized using the elements of delay Vandermonde matrix (DVM), answering the longstanding beam-squint problem.Thus, building on our work on classical algorithms based on DVM, we propose neural network (NN) architecture to realize wideband multi-beam beamformers using structure-imposed weight matrices and submatrices.The structure and sparsity of the weight matrices and submatrices are shown to reduce the space and computational complexities of the NN greatly.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The proposed network architecture has O(pLM logM) complexity compared to a conventional fully connected L-layers network with O(M2L) <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span>complexity, where M is the number of nodes in each layer of the network, p is the number of submatrices per layer, and M >>p.We will show numerical simulations in the 24 GHz to 32 GHz range to demonstrate the numerical feasibility of realizing wideband multi-beam beamformers using the proposed neural architecture.We also show the complexity reduction of the proposed NN and compare that with fully connected NNs, to show the efficiency of the proposed architecture without sacrificing accuracy.The accuracy of the proposed NN architecture was shown using the mean squared error, which is based on an objective function of the weight matrices and beamformed signals of antenna arrays, while also normalizing nodes.The proposed NN architecture shows a low-complexity NN realizing wideband multi-beam beamformers in real-time for low-complexity intelligent systems.</p>
