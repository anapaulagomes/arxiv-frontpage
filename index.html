                  <p>Music streaming services often leverage sequential recommender systems to predict the best music to showcase to users based on past sequences of listening sessions.Nonetheless, most sequential recommendation methods ignore or insufficiently account for repetitive behaviors.This is a crucial limitation for music recommendation, as repeatedly listening to the same song over time is a common phenomenon that can even change the way users perceive this song.In this paper, we introduce PISA (Psychology-Informed Session embedding using ACT-R), a session-level sequential recommender system that overcomes this limitation.PISA employs a Transformer architecture learning embedding representations of listening sessions and users using attention mechanisms inspired by Anderson's ACT-R (Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational), a cognitive architecture modeling human information access and memory dynamics.This approach enables us to capture dynamic and repetitive patterns from user behaviors, allowing us to effectively predict the songs they will listen to in subsequent sessions, whether they are repeated or new ones.We demonstrate the empirical relevance of PISA using both publicly available listening data from Last.fm and proprietary data from Deezer, a global music streaming service, confirming the critical importance of repetition modeling for sequential listening session recommendation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Along with this paper, we publicly release our proprietary dataset to foster future research in this field, as well as the source code of PISA to facilitate its future use. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.742</span></span></p>

                  <p>Understanding human actions from videos is essential in many domains, including sports.In figure skating, technical judgments are performed by watching skaters' 3D movements, and its part of the judging procedure can be regarded as a Temporal Action Segmentation (TAS) task.TAS tasks in figure skating that automatically assign temporal semantics to video are actively researched.However, there is a lack of datasets and effective methods for TAS tasks requiring 3D pose data.In this study, we first created the FS-Jump3D dataset of complex and dynamic figure skating jumps using optical markerless motion capture.We also propose a new fine-grained figure skating jump TAS dataset annotation method with which TAS models can learn jump procedures.In the experimental results, we validated the usefulness of 3D pose features as input and the fine-grained dataset for the TAS model in figure skating.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>FS-Jump3D Dataset is available at https://github.com/ryota-skating/FS-Jump3D. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.835</span></span></p>

                  <p>Salient Object Detection (SOD) has traditionally relied on feature refinement modules that utilize the features of an ImageNet pre-trained backbone.However, this approach limits the possibility of pre-training the entire network because of the distinct nature of SOD and image classification.Additionally, the architecture of these backbones originally built for Image classification is sub-optimal for a dense prediction task like SOD.To address these issues, we propose a novel encoder-decoder-style neural network called SODAWideNet++ that is designed explicitly for SOD.Inspired by the vision transformers ability to attain a global receptive field from the initial stages, we introduce the Attention Guided Long Range Feature Extraction (AGLRFE) module, which combines large dilated convolutions and self-attention.Specifically, we use attention features to guide long-range information extracted by multiple dilated convolutions, thus taking advantage of the inductive biases of a convolution operation and the input dependency brought by self-attention.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In contrast to the current paradigm of ImageNet pre-training, we modify 118K annotated images from the COCO semantic segmentation dataset by binarizing the annotations to pre-train the proposed model end-to-end. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.702</span></span>Further, we supervise the background predictions along with the foreground to push our model to generate accurate saliency predictions.SODAWideNet++ performs competitively on five different datasets while only containing 35% of the trainable parameters compared to the state-of-the-art models.The code and pre-computed saliency maps are provided at https://github.com/VimsLab/SODAWideNetPlusPlus.</p>

                  <p>Multimodal foundation models serve numerous applications at the intersection of vision and language.Still, despite being pretrained on extensive data, they become outdated over time.To keep models updated, research into continual pretraining mainly explores scenarios with either (1) infrequent, indiscriminate updates on large-scale new data, or (2) frequent, sample-level updates.However, practical model deployment often operates in the gap between these two limit cases, as real-world applications often demand adaptation to specific subdomains, tasks or concepts -- spread over the entire, varying life cycle of a model.In this work, we complement current perspectives on continual pretraining through a research test bed as well as provide comprehensive guidance for effective continual model updates in such scenarios.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We first introduce FoMo-in-Flux, a continual multimodal pretraining benchmark with realistic compute constraints and practical deployment requirements, constructed over 63 datasets with diverse visual and semantic coverage. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.775</span></span>Using FoMo-in-Flux, we explore the complex landscape of practical continual pretraining through multiple perspectives: (1) A data-centric investigation of data mixtures and stream orderings that emulate real-world deployment situations, (2) a method-centric investigation ranging from simple fine-tuning and traditional continual learning strategies to parameter-efficient updates and model merging, (3) meta learning rate schedules and mechanistic design choices, and (4) the influence of model and compute scaling.Together, our insights provide a practitioner's guide to continual multimodal pretraining for real-world deployment.Our benchmark and code is here: https://github.com/ExplainableML/fomo_in_flux.</p>

                  <p>Anomaly detection is critical in surveillance systems and patrol robots by identifying anomalous regions in images for early warning.Depending on whether reference data are utilized, anomaly detection can be categorized into anomaly detection with reference and anomaly detection without reference.Currently, anomaly detection without reference, which is closely related to out-of-distribution (OoD) object detection, struggles with learning anomalous patterns due to the difficulty of collecting sufficiently large and diverse anomaly datasets with the inherent rarity and novelty of anomalies.Alternatively, anomaly detection with reference employs the scheme of change detection to identify anomalies by comparing semantic changes between a reference image and a query one.However, there are very few ADr works due to the scarcity of public datasets in this domain.In this paper, we aim to address this gap by introducing the UMAD Benchmark Dataset.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To our best knowledge, this is the first benchmark dataset designed specifically for anomaly detection with reference in robotic patrolling scenarios, e.g., where an autonomous robot is employed to detect anomalous objects by comparing a reference and a query video sequences. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.788</span></span>The reference sequences can be taken by the robot along a specified route when there are no anomalous objects in the scene.The query sequences are captured online by the robot when it is patrolling in the same scene following the same route.Our benchmark dataset is elaborated such that each query image can find a corresponding reference based on accurate robot localization along the same route in the prebuilt 3D map, with which the reference and query images can be geometrically aligned using adaptive warping.Besides the proposed benchmark dataset, we evaluate the baseline models of ADr on this dataset.</p>

                  <p>MPI+X has been the de facto standard for distributed memory parallel programming.It is widely used primarily as an explicit two-sided communication model, which often leads to complex and error-prone code.Alternatively, PGAS model utilizes efficient one-sided communication and more intuitive communication primitives.In this paper, we present a novel approach that integrates PGAS concepts into the OpenMP programming model, leveraging the LLVM compiler infrastructure and the GASNet-EX communication library.Our model addresses the complexity associated with traditional MPI+OpenMP programming models while ensuring excellent performance and scalability.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate our approach using a set of micro-benchmarks and application kernels on two distinct platforms: Ookami from Stony Brook University and NERSC Perlmutter. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.657</span></span>The results demonstrate that DiOMP achieves superior bandwidth and lower latency compared to MPI+OpenMP, up to 25% higher bandwidth and down to 45% on latency.DiOMP offers a promising alternative to the traditional MPI+OpenMP hybrid programming model, towards providing a more productive and efficient way to develop high-performance parallel applications for distributed memory systems.</p>

                  <p>Transfer learning based on full fine-tuning (FFT) of the pre-trained encoder and task-specific decoder becomes increasingly complex as deep models grow exponentially.Parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) approaches using adapters consisting of small learnable layers have emerged as an alternative to FFT, achieving comparable performance while maintaining high training efficiency.However, the inflexibility of the adapter with respect to input instances limits its capability of learning task-specific information in diverse downstream tasks.In this paper, we propose a novel PEFT approach, input-Conditioned transFormer, termed iConFormer, that leverages a dynamic adapter conditioned on the input instances.To secure flexible learning ability on input instances in various downstream tasks, we introduce an input-Conditioned Network (iCoN) in the dynamic adapter that enables instance-level feature transformation.To be specific, iCoN generates channel-wise convolutional kernels for each feature and transform it using adaptive convolution process to effectively capture task-specific and fine-grained details tailor to downstream tasks.Experimental results demonstrate that by tuning just 1.6% to 2.8% of the Transformer backbone parameters, iConFormer achieves performance comparable to FFT in monocular depth estimation and semantic segmentation, while outperforming it in image classification and instance segmentation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Also, the proposed method consistently outperforms recent PEFT methods for all the tasks mentioned above. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.64</span></span></p>

                  <p>Few-shot image classifiers are designed to recognize and classify new data with minimal supervision and limited data but often show reliance on spurious correlations between classes and spurious attributes, known as spurious bias.Spurious correlations commonly hold in certain samples and few-shot classifiers can suffer from spurious bias induced from them.There is an absence of an automatic benchmarking system to assess the robustness of few-shot classifiers against spurious bias.In this paper, we propose a systematic and rigorous benchmark framework, termed FewSTAB, to fairly demonstrate and quantify varied degrees of robustness of few-shot classifiers to spurious bias.FewSTAB creates few-shot evaluation tasks with biased attributes so that using them for predictions can demonstrate poor performance.To construct these tasks, we propose attribute-based sample selection strategies based on a pre-trained vision-language model, eliminating the need for manual dataset curation.This allows FewSTAB to automatically benchmark spurious bias using any existing test data.FewSTAB offers evaluation results in a new dimension along with a new design guideline for building robust classifiers.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, it can benchmark spurious bias in varied degrees and enable designs for varied degrees of robustness. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span>Its effectiveness is demonstrated through experiments on ten few-shot learning methods across three datasets.We hope our framework can inspire new designs of robust few-shot classifiers.Our code is available at https://github.com/gtzheng/FewSTAB.</p>

                  <p>The performance of Video Instance Segmentation (VIS) methods has improved significantly with the advent of transformer networks.However, these networks often face challenges in training due to the high annotation cost.To address this, unsupervised and weakly-supervised methods have been developed to reduce the dependency on annotations.This work introduces a novel weakly-supervised method called Eigen-cluster VIS that, without requiring any mask annotations, achieves competitive accuracy compared to other VIS approaches.This method is based on two key innovations: a Temporal Eigenvalue Loss (TEL) and a clip-level Quality Cluster Coefficient (QCC).The TEL ensures temporal coherence by leveraging the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix derived from graph adjacency matrices.By minimizing the mean absolute error (MAE) between the eigenvalues of adjacent frames, this loss function promotes smooth transitions and stable segmentation boundaries over time, reducing temporal discontinuities and improving overall segmentation quality.The QCC employs the K-means method to ensure the quality of spatio-temporal clusters without relying on ground truth masks.Using the Davies-Bouldin score, the QCC provides an unsupervised measure of feature discrimination, allowing the model to self-evaluate and adapt to varying object distributions, enhancing robustness during the testing phase.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These enhancements are computationally efficient and straightforward, offering significant performance gains without additional annotated data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.623</span></span>The proposed Eigen-Cluster VIS method is evaluated on the YouTube-VIS 2019/2021 and OVIS datasets, demonstrating that it effectively narrows the performance gap between the fully-supervised and weakly-supervised VIS approaches.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code is available on: https://github.com/farnooshar/EigenClusterVIS <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.609</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent advances in text-to-image personalization have enabled high-quality and controllable image synthesis for user-provided concepts.However, existing methods still struggle to balance identity preservation with text alignment.Our approach is based on the fact that generating prompt-aligned images requires a precise semantic understanding of the prompt, which involves accurately processing the interactions between the new concept and its surrounding context tokens within the CLIP text encoder.To address this, we aim to embed the new concept properly into the input embedding space of the text encoder, allowing for seamless integration with existing tokens.We introduce Context Regularization (CoRe), which enhances the learning of the new concept's text embedding by regularizing its context tokens in the prompt.This is based on the insight that appropriate output vectors of the text encoder for the context tokens can only be achieved if the new concept's text embedding is correctly learned.CoRe can be applied to arbitrary prompts without requiring the generation of corresponding images, thus improving the generalization of the learned text embedding.Additionally, CoRe can serve as a test-time optimization technique to further enhance the generations for specific prompts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms several baseline methods in both identity preservation and text alignment. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.639</span></span>Code will be made publicly available.</p>

We may call this comprehensive system a parametric primary decomposition of the ideal.Also, one can also compute a dense set $\mathcal{O}$ such that $\varphi_\alpha(\mathcal{Q})$ is a primary decomposition for any $\alpha\in C\cap \mathcal{O}$ via irreducible polynomials.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, we give several computational examples to examine the effectiveness of our new decomposition. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span></p>

In this work, we focus on leveraging the properties of semantic graphs to enhance HGNN performance.First, we analyze the Semantic Graph Build (SGB) stage and identify significant opportunities for data reuse during semantic graph generation.Next, we uncover the phenomenon of buffer thrashing during the Graph Feature Processing (GFP) stage, revealing potential optimization opportunities in semantic graph layout.Furthermore, we propose a lightweight hardware accelerator frontend for HGNNs, called SiHGNN.This accelerator frontend incorporates a tree-based Semantic Graph Builder for efficient semantic graph generation and features a novel Graph Restructurer for optimizing semantic graph layouts.Experimental results show that SiHGNN enables the state-of-the-art HGNN accelerator to achieve an average performance improvement of 2.95$\times$.</p>

                  <p>In this paper, we investigate a variant of the classical stochastic Multi-armed Bandit (MAB) problem, where the payoff received by an agent (either cost or reward) is both delayed, and directly corresponds to the magnitude of the delay.This setting models faithfully many real world scenarios such as the time it takes for a data packet to traverse a network given a choice of route (where delay serves as the agent's cost); or a user's time spent on a web page given a choice of content (where delay serves as the agent's reward).   Our main contributions are tight upper and lower bounds for both the cost and reward settings.For the case that delays serve as costs, which we are the first to consider, we prove optimal regret that scales as $\sum_{i:\Delta_i > 0}\frac{\logT}{\Delta_i} + d^*$, where $T$ is the maximal number of steps, $\Delta_i$ are the sub-optimality gaps and $d^*$ is the minimal expected delay amongst arms.For the case that delays serves as rewards, we show optimal regret of $\sum_{i:\Delta_i > 0}\frac{\log T}{\Delta_i} + \bar{d}$, where $\bar d$ is the second maximal expected delay.These improve over the regret in the general delay-dependent payoff setting, which scales as $\sum_{i:\Delta_i > 0}\frac{\log T}{\Delta_i} + D$, where $D$ is the maximum possible delay.Our regret bounds highlight the difference between the cost and reward scenarios, showing that the improvement in the cost scenario is more significant than for the reward.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we accompany our theoretical results with an empirical evaluation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span></p>

                  <p>Promptable segmentation typically requires instance-specific manual prompts to guide the segmentation of each desired object.To minimize such a need, task-generic promptable segmentation has been introduced, which employs a single task-generic prompt to segment various images of different objects in the same task.Current methods use Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to reason detailed instance-specific prompts from a task-generic prompt for improving segmentation accuracy.The effectiveness of this segmentation heavily depends on the precision of these derived prompts.However, MLLMs often suffer hallucinations during reasoning, resulting in inaccurate prompting.While existing methods focus on eliminating hallucinations to improve a model, we argue that MLLM hallucinations can reveal valuable contextual insights when leveraged correctly, as they represent pre-trained large-scale knowledge beyond individual images.In this paper, we utilize hallucinations to mine task-related information from images and verify its accuracy for enhancing precision of the generated prompts.Specifically, we introduce an iterative Prompt-Mask Cycle generation framework (ProMaC) with a prompt generator and a mask generator.The prompt generator uses a multi-scale chain of thought prompting, initially exploring hallucinations for extracting extended contextual knowledge on a test image.These hallucinations are then reduced to formulate precise instance-specific prompts, directing the mask generator to produce masks that are consistent with task semantics by mask semantic alignment.The generated masks iteratively induce the prompt generator to focus more on task-relevant image areas and reduce irrelevant hallucinations, resulting jointly in better prompts and masks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments on 5 benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of ProMaC.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to early detection of performance regressions by bridging the local performance data generated by component-level testing and the system-level architectural models.Our approach uses local performance data to identify deviations at the component level, and then propagate these deviations to the architectural model.We then use the architectural model to predict regressions in the performance of the overall system.We evaluate our approach on two open-source benchmark systems and show that it can effectively detect end-to-end system performance regressions from local performance deviations with different intensities and under various system workloads.More importantly, our approach can detect regressions as early as in the development phase, in contrast to existing approaches that require the system to be fully built and deployed.Our approach is lightweight and can complement traditional system performance testing when testing resources are scarce.</p>
