                  <p>Significant advances have been made in natural language processing in recent years.However, our current deep learning approach to language modeling requires substantial resources in terms of data and computation.One of the side effects of this data-hungry paradigm is the current schism between languages, separating those considered high-resource, where most of the development happens and resources are available, and the low-resource ones, which struggle to attain the same level of performance and autonomy.This study aims to introduce a new set of resources to stimulate the future development of neural text generation in Portuguese.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we document the development of GigaVerbo, a concatenation of deduplicated Portuguese text corpora amounting to 200 billion tokens. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.726</span></span>Via this corpus, we trained a series of decoder-transformers named Tucano.Our models perform equal or superior to other Portuguese and multilingual language models of similar size in several Portuguese benchmarks.The evaluation of our models also reveals that model performance on many currently available benchmarks used by the Portuguese NLP community has little to no correlation with the scaling of token ingestion during training, highlighting the limitations of such evaluations when it comes to the assessment of Portuguese generative language models.All derivatives of our study are openly released on GitHub and Hugging Face.See https://nkluge-correa.github.io/Tucano/</p>

                  <p>When unsure about an answer, humans often respond with more words than necessary, hoping that part of the response will be correct.We observe a similar behavior in large language models (LLMs), which we term "Verbosity Compensation" (VC).VC is harmful because it confuses the user understanding, leading to low efficiency, and influences the LLM services by increasing the latency and cost of generating useless tokens.In this paper, we present the first work that defines and analyzes Verbosity Compensation, explores its causes, and proposes a simple mitigating approach.We define Verbosity Compensation as the behavior of generating responses that can be compressed without information loss when prompted to write concisely.Our experiments, conducted on five datasets of knowledge and reasoning-based QA tasks with 14 newly developed LLMs, reveal three conclusions.1) We reveal a pervasive presence of verbosity compensation across all models and all datasets.Notably, GPT-4 exhibits a VC frequency of 50.40%.2)We reveal the large performance gap between verbose and concise responses, with a notable difference of 27.61% on the Qasper dataset.We also demonstrate that this difference does not naturally diminish as LLM capability increases.Both 1) and 2) highlight the urgent need to mitigate the frequency of VC behavior and disentangle verbosity with veracity.We propose a simple yet effective cascade algorithm that replaces the verbose responses with the other model-generated responses.The results show that our approach effectively alleviates the VC of the Mistral model from 63.81% to 16.16% on the Qasper dataset.3) We also find that verbose responses exhibit higher uncertainty across all five datasets, suggesting a strong connection between verbosity and model uncertainty.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our dataset and code are available at https://github.com/psunlpgroup/VerbosityLLM. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.837</span></span></p>

                  <p>With the recent exhibited strength of generative diffusion models, an open research question is \textit{if images generated by these models can be used to learn better visual representations}.While this generative data expansion may suffice for easier visual tasks, we explore its efficacy on a more difficult discriminative task: clothes-changing person re-identification (CC-ReID).CC-ReID aims to match people appearing in non-overlapping cameras, even when they change their clothes across cameras.Not only are current CC-ReID models constrained by the limited diversity of clothing in current CC-ReID datasets, but generating additional data that retains important personal features for accurate identification is a current challenge.To address this issue we propose DLCR, a novel data expansion framework that leverages pre-trained diffusion and large language models (LLMs) to accurately generate diverse images of individuals in varied attire.We generate additional data for five benchmark CC-ReID datasets (PRCC, CCVID, LaST, VC-Clothes, and LTCC) and \textbf{increase their clothing diversity by \boldmath{$10$}x, totaling over \boldmath{$2.1$}M images generated}.DLCR employs diffusion-based text-guided inpainting, conditioned on clothing prompts constructed using LLMs, to generate synthetic data that only modifies a subject's clothes while preserving their personally identifiable features.With this massive increase in data, we introduce two novel strategies - progressive learning and test-time prediction refinement - that respectively reduce training time and further boosts CC-ReID performance.On the PRCC dataset, we obtain a large top-1 accuracy improvement of $11.3\%$ by training CAL, a previous state of the art (SOTA) method, with DLCR-generated data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We publicly release our code and generated data for each dataset here: \url{https://github.com/CroitoruAlin/dlcr}. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.907</span></span></p>

                  <p>Supporting the health and well-being of dynamic populations around the world requires governmental agencies, organizations and researchers to understand and reason over complex relationships between human behavior and local contexts in order to identify high-risk groups and strategically allocate limited resources.Traditional approaches to these classes of problems often entail developing manually curated, task-specific features and models to represent human behavior and the natural and built environment, which can be challenging to adapt to new, or even, related tasks.To address this, we introduce a Population Dynamics Foundation Model (PDFM) that aims to capture the relationships between diverse data modalities and is applicable to a broad range of geospatial tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We first construct a geo-indexed dataset for postal codes and counties across the United States, capturing rich aggregated information on human behavior from maps, busyness, and aggregated search trends, and environmental factors such as weather and air quality. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.804</span></span>We then model this data and the complex relationships between locations using a graph neural network, producing embeddings that can be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks using relatively simple models.We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach by benchmarking it on 27 downstream tasks spanning three distinct domains: health indicators, socioeconomic factors, and environmental measurements.The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on all 27 geospatial interpolation tasks, and on 25 out of the 27 extrapolation and super-resolution tasks.We combined the PDFM with a state-of-the-art forecasting foundation model, TimesFM, to predict unemployment and poverty, achieving performance that surpasses fully supervised forecasting.The full set of embeddings and sample code are publicly available for researchers.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced their knowledge and generative capabilities, leading to a surge of interest in leveraging LLMs for high-quality data synthesis.However, synthetic data generation via prompting LLMs remains challenging due to LLMs' limited understanding of target data distributions and the complexity of prompt engineering, especially for structured formatted data.To address these issues, we introduce DiffLM, a controllable data synthesis framework based on variational autoencoder (VAE), which further (1) leverages diffusion models to reserve more information of original distribution and format structure in the learned latent distribution and (2) decouples the learning of target distribution knowledge from the LLM's generative objectives via a plug-and-play latent feature injection module.As we observed significant discrepancies between the VAE's latent representations and the real data distribution, the latent diffusion module is introduced into our framework to learn a fully expressive latent distribution.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Evaluations on seven real-world datasets with structured formatted data (i.e., Tabular, Code and Tool data) demonstrate that DiffLM generates high-quality data, with performance on downstream tasks surpassing that of real data by 2-7 percent in certain cases. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.812</span></span>The data and code will be publicly available upon completion of internal review.</p>

                  <p>Converting webpage design into functional UI code is a critical step for building websites, which can be labor-intensive and time-consuming.To automate this design-to-code transformation process, various automated methods using learning-based networks and multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have been proposed.However, these studies were merely evaluated on a narrow range of static web pages and ignored dynamic interaction elements, making them less practical for real-world website deployment.   To fill in the blank, we present the first systematic investigation of MLLMs in generating interactive webpages.Specifically, we first formulate the Interaction-to-Code task and build the Interaction2Code benchmark that contains 97 unique web pages and 213 distinct interactions, spanning 15 webpage types and 30 interaction categories.We then conduct comprehensive experiments on three state-of-the-art (SOTA) MLLMs using both automatic metrics and human evaluations, thereby summarizing six findings accordingly.Our experimental results highlight the limitations of MLLMs in generating fine-grained interactive features and managing interactions with complex transformations and subtle visual modifications.We further analyze failure cases and their underlying causes, identifying 10 common failure types and assessing their severity.Additionally, our findings reveal three critical influencing factors, i.e., prompts, visual saliency, and textual descriptions, that can enhance the interaction generation performance of MLLMs.Based on these findings, we elicit implications for researchers and developers, providing a foundation for future advancements in this field.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Datasets and source code are available at https://github.com/WebPAI/Interaction2Code. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.87</span></span></p>

                  <p>Code translation transforms programs from one programming language (PL) to another.Several rule-based transpilers have been designed to automate code translation between different pairs of PLs.However, the rules can become obsolete as the PLs evolve and cannot generalize to other PLs.Recent studies have explored the automation of code translation using Large Language Models (LLMs).One key observation is that such techniques may work well for crafted benchmarks but fail to generalize to the scale and complexity of real-world projects with dependencies, custom types, PL-specific features, etc.   We propose AlphaTrans, a neuro-symbolic approach to automate repository-level code translation.AlphaTrans translates both source and test code, and employs multiple levels of validation to ensure the translation preserves the functionality of the source program.To break down the problem for LLMs, AlphaTrans leverages program analysis to decompose the program into fragments and translates them in the reverse call order.We leveraged AlphaTrans to translate ten real-world open-source projects consisting of <836, 8575, 2719> classes, methods, and tests.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>AlphaTrans translated the entire repository of these projects consisting of 6899 source code fragments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.805</span></span>99.1% of the translated code fragments are syntactically correct, and AlphaTrans validates the translations' runtime behavior and functional correctness for 25.8%.On average, the integrated translation and validation take 36 hours to translate a project, showing its scalability in practice.For the syntactically or semantically incorrect translations, AlphaTrans generates a report including existing translation, stack trace, test errors, or assertion failures.We provided these artifacts to two developers to fix the translation bugs in four projects.They were able to fix the issues in 20.1 hours on average and achieve all passing tests.</p>

                  <p>In real-world NLP applications, Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising solutions due to their extensive training on vast datasets.However, the large size and high computation demands of LLMs limit their practicality in many applications, especially when further fine-tuning is required.To address these limitations, smaller models are typically preferred for deployment.However, their training is hindered by the scarcity of labeled data.In contrast, unlabeled data is often readily which can be leveraged by using LLMs to generate pseudo-labels for training smaller models.This enables the smaller models (student) to acquire knowledge from LLMs(teacher) while reducing computational costs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This process introduces challenges, such as potential noisy pseudo-labels. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.612</span></span>Selecting high-quality and informative data is therefore critical to enhance model performance while improving the efficiency of data utilization.To address this, we propose LLKD that enables Learning with Less computational resources and less data for Knowledge Distillation from LLMs.LLKD is an adaptive sample selection method that incorporates signals from both the teacher and student.Specifically, it prioritizes samples where the teacher demonstrates high confidence in its labeling, indicating reliable labels, and where the student exhibits a high information need, identifying challenging samples that require further learning.Our comprehensive experiments show that LLKD achieves superior performance across various datasets with higher data efficiency.</p>

                  <p>Characterizing the computational power of neural network architectures in terms of formal language theory remains a crucial line of research, as it describes lower and upper bounds on the reasoning capabilities of modern AI.However, when empirically testing these bounds, existing work often leaves a discrepancy between experiments and the formal claims they are meant to support.The problem is that formal language theory pertains specifically to recognizers: machines that receive a string as input and classify whether it belongs to a language.On the other hand, it is common to instead use proxy tasks that are similar in only an informal sense, such as language modeling or sequence-to-sequence transduction.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We correct this mismatch by training and evaluating neural networks directly as binary classifiers of strings, using a general method that can be applied to a wide variety of languages. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span>As part of this, we extend an algorithm recently proposed by Sn{\ae}bjarnarson et al.

                  <p>Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) provide principled estimates of model and data uncertainty by encoding parameters as distributions.This makes them key enablers for reliable AI that can be deployed on safety critical edge systems.These systems can be made resource efficient by restricting synapses to two synaptic states $\{-1,+1\}$ and using a memristive in-memory computing (IMC) paradigm.However, BNNs pose an additional challenge -- they require multiple instantiations for ensembling, consuming extra resources in terms of energy and area.In this work, we propose a novel sparsity-aware optimization for Bayesian Binary Neural Network (BBNN) accelerators that exploits the inherent BBNN sampling sparsity -- most of the network is made up of synapses that have a high probability of being fixed at $\pm1$ and require no sampling.The optimization scheme proposed here exploits the sampling sparsity that exists both among layers, i.e only a few layers of the network contain a majority of the probabilistic synapses, as well as the parameters i.e., a tiny fraction of parameters in these layers require sampling, reducing total sampled parameter count further by up to $86\%$. We demonstrate no loss in accuracy or uncertainty quantification performance for a VGGBinaryConnect network on CIFAR-100 dataset mapped on a custom sparsity-aware phase change memory (PCM) based IMC simulator.We also develop a simple drift compensation technique to demonstrate robustness to drift-induced degradation.Finally, we project latency, energy, and area for sparsity-aware BNN implementation in both pipelined and non-pipelined modes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>With sparsity-aware implementation, we estimate upto $5.3 \times$ reduction in area and $8.8\times$ reduction in energy compared to a non-sparsity-aware implementation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.624</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our approach also results in $2.9 \times $ more power efficiency compared to the state-of-the-art BNN accelerator. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span></p>

                  <p>The advanced role-playing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have paved the way for developing Role-Playing Agents (RPAs).However, existing benchmarks, such as HPD, which incorporates manually scored character relationships into the context for LLMs to sort coherence, and SocialBench, which uses specific profiles generated by LLMs in the context of multiple-choice tasks to assess character preferences, face limitations like poor generalizability, implicit and inaccurate judgments, and excessive context length.To address the above issues, we propose an automatic, scalable, and generalizable paradigm.Specifically, we construct a benchmark by extracting relations from a general knowledge graph and leverage RPA's inherent hallucination properties to prompt it to interact across roles, employing ChatGPT for stance detection and defining relationship hallucination along with three related metrics.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and stability of our metrics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.64</span></span>Our findings further explore factors influencing these metrics and discuss the trade-off between relationship hallucination and factuality.</p>

                  <p>Network pruning is a set of computational techniques that aim to reduce a given model's computational cost by removing a subset of its parameters while having minimal impact on performance.Throughout the last decade, the most widely used pruning paradigm has focused on pruning and re-training, which nowadays is inconvenient due to the vast amount of pre-trained models, which are in any case too expensive to re-train.In this paper, we exploit functional information from dense pre-trained models, i.e., their activations, to obtain sparse models that maximize the activations' alignment w.r.t.their corresponding dense models.Hence, we propose \textsc{NeuroAl}, a \emph{top-up} algorithm that can be used on top of any given pruning algorithm for LLMs, that modifies the block-wise and row-wise sparsity ratios to maximize the \emph{neuron alignment} among activations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, differently from existing methods, our approach adaptively selects the best parameters for the block-wise and row-wise sparsity ratios w.r.t. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.686</span></span>to the model and the desired sparsity (given as input), and requires \emph{no re-training}.We test our method on 4 different LLM families and 3 different sparsity ratios, showing how it consistently outperforms the latest state-of-the-art techniques.The code is available at https://github.com/eliacunegatti/NeuroAL.</p>

                  <p>Infinite-state reactive synthesis has attracted significant attention in recent years, which has led to the emergence of novel symbolic techniques for solving infinite-state games.Temporal logics featuring variables over infinite domains offer an expressive high-level specification language for infinite-state reactive systems.Currently, the only way to translate these temporal logics into symbolic games is by naively encoding the specification to use techniques designed for the Boolean case.An inherent limitation of this approach is that it results in games in which the semantic structure of the temporal and first-order constraints present in the formula is lost.There is a clear need for techniques that leverage this information in the translation process to speed up solving the generated games.   In this work, we propose the first approach that addresses this gap.Our technique constructs a monitor incorporating first-order and temporal reasoning at the formula level, enriching the constructed game with semantic information that leads to more efficient solving.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We demonstrate that thanks to this, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques across a range of benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.772</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recently, quadrupedal locomotion has achieved significant success, but their manipulation capabilities, particularly in handling large objects, remain limited, restricting their usefulness in demanding real-world applications such as search and rescue, construction, industrial automation, and room organization.This paper tackles the task of obstacle-aware, long-horizon pushing by multiple quadrupedal robots.We propose a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework with three levels of control.The high-level controller integrates an RRT planner and a centralized adaptive policy to generate subgoals, while the mid-level controller uses a decentralized goal-conditioned policy to guide the robots toward these sub-goals.A pre-trained low-level locomotion policy executes the movement commands.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate our method against several baselines in simulation, demonstrating significant improvements over baseline approaches, with 36.0% higher success rates and 24.5% reduction in completion time than the best baseline. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.721</span></span>Our framework successfully enables long-horizon, obstacle-aware manipulation tasks like Push-Cuboid and Push-T on Go1 robots in the real world.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in code generation recently, offering programmers revolutionary assistance in software development.However, due to the auto-regressive nature of LLMs, they are susceptible to error accumulation during code generation.Once an error is produced, LLMs can merely continue to generate the subsequent code conditioned on it, given their inability to adjust previous outputs.Existing LLM-based approaches typically consider post-revising after code generation, leading to the challenging resolution of accumulated errors and the significant wastage of resources.Ideally, LLMs should rollback and resolve the occurred error in time during code generation, rather than proceed on the basis of the error and wait for post-revising after generation.In this paper, we propose ROCODE, which integrates the backtracking mechanism and program analysis into LLMs for code generation.Specifically, we employ program analysis to perform incremental error detection during the generation process.When an error is detected, the backtracking mechanism is triggered to priming rollback strategies and constraint regeneration, thereby eliminating the error early and ensuring continued generation on the correct basis.Experiments on multiple code generation benchmarks show that ROCODE can significantly reduce the errors generated by LLMs, with a compilation pass rate of 99.1%.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The test pass rate is improved by up to 23.8% compared to the best baseline approach. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.651</span></span>Compared to the post-revising baseline, the token cost is reduced by 19.3%.Moreover, our approach is model-agnostic and achieves consistent improvements across nine representative LLMs.</p>

GEM uses a generative model to estimate mutual information between candidate and reference responses, without requiring the reference to be a gold standard.In experiments on a human-annotated dataset, GEM demonstrates competitive correlations with human scores compared to the state-of-the-art GPT-4o Examiner, and outperforms all other baselines.Additionally, GEM is more robust against strategic manipulations, such as rephrasing or elongation, which can artificially inflate scores under a GPT-4o Examiner.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also present GRE-bench (Generating Review Evaluation Benchmark) which evaluates LLMs based on how well they can generate high-quality peer reviews for academic research papers. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.636</span></span>Because GRE-bench is based upon GEM, it inherits its robustness properties.Additionally, GRE-bench circumvents data contamination problems (or data leakage) by using the continuous influx of new open-access research papers and peer reviews each year.We show GRE-bench results of various popular LLMs on their peer review capabilities using the ICLR2023 dataset.</p>

                  <p>Despite their power, Transformers face challenges with long sequences due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention.To address this limitation, methods like $k$-Nearest-Neighbor ($k$NN) attention have been introduced [Roy, Saffar, Vaswani, Grangier, 2021] enabling each token to attend to only its $k$ closest tokens.While $k$NN attention has shown empirical success in making Transformers more efficient, its exact approximation guarantees have not been theoretically analyzed.In this work, we establish a theoretical framework for $k$NN attention, reformulating self-attention as expectations over softmax distributions and leveraging lazy Gumbel sampling [Mussmann, Levy, Ermon, 2017] with $k$NN indices for efficient approximation.Building on this framework, we also propose novel sub-quadratic algorithms that approximate self-attention gradients by leveraging efficient sampling techniques, such as Markov Chain-based estimation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we demonstrate the practical effectiveness of these algorithms through empirical experiments, showcasing their benefits in both training and inference. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.65</span></span></p>

                  <p>When unsure about an answer, humans often respond with more words than necessary, hoping that part of the response will be correct.We observe a similar behavior in large language models (LLMs), which we term "Verbosity Compensation" (VC).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>VC is harmful because it confuses the user understanding, leading to low efficiency, and influences the LLM services by increasing the latency and cost of generating useless tokens. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.71</span></span>In this paper, we present the first work that defines and analyzes Verbosity Compensation, explores its causes, and proposes a simple mitigating approach.We define Verbosity Compensation as the behavior of generating responses that can be compressed without information loss when prompted to write concisely.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experiments, conducted on five datasets of knowledge and reasoning-based QA tasks with 14 newly developed LLMs, reveal three conclusions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.669</span></span>1) We reveal a pervasive presence of verbosity compensation across all models and all datasets.Notably, GPT-4 exhibits a VC frequency of 50.40%.2)We reveal the large performance gap between verbose and concise responses, with a notable difference of 27.61% on the Qasper dataset.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also demonstrate that this difference does not naturally diminish as LLM capability increases. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.776</span></span>Both 1) and 2) highlight the urgent need to mitigate the frequency of VC behavior and disentangle verbosity with veracity.We propose a simple yet effective cascade algorithm that replaces the verbose responses with the other model-generated responses.The results show that our approach effectively alleviates the VC of the Mistral model from 63.81% to 16.16% on the Qasper dataset.3) We also find that verbose responses exhibit higher uncertainty across all five datasets, suggesting a strong connection between verbosity and model uncertainty.Our dataset and code are available at https://github.com/psunlpgroup/VerbosityLLM.</p>

                  <p>Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) provide superior estimates of uncertainty by generating an ensemble of predictive distributions.However, inference via ensembling is resource-intensive, requiring additional entropy sources to generate stochasticity which increases resource consumption.We introduce Bayes2IMC, an in-memory computing (IMC) architecture designed for binary Bayesian neural networks that leverage nanoscale device stochasticity to generate desired distributions.Our novel approach utilizes Phase-Change Memory (PCM) to harness inherent noise characteristics, enabling the creation of a binary neural network.This design eliminates the necessity for a pre-neuron Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC), significantly improving power and area efficiency.We also develop a hardware-software co-optimized correction method applied solely on the logits in the final layer to reduce device-induced accuracy variations across deployments on hardware.Additionally, we devise a simple compensation technique that ensures no drop in classification accuracy despite conductance drift of PCM.We validate the effectiveness of our approach on the CIFAR-10 dataset with a VGGBinaryConnect model, achieving accuracy metrics comparable to ideal software implementations as well as results reported in the literature using other technologies.Finally, we present a complete core architecture and compare its projected power, performance, and area efficiency against an equivalent SRAM baseline, showing a $3.8$ to $9.6 \times$ improvement in total efficiency (in GOPS/W/mm$^2$) and a $2.2 $ to $5.6 \times$ improvement in power efficiency (in GOPS/W).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, the projected hardware performance of Bayes2IMC surpasses that of most of the BNN architectures based on memristive devices reported in the literature, and achieves up to $20\%$ higher power efficiency compared to the state-of-the-art. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.624</span></span></p>

                  <p>Physical reasoning is an important skill needed for robotic agents when operating in the real world.However, solving such reasoning problems often involves hypothesizing and reflecting over complex multi-body interactions under the effect of a multitude of physical forces and thus learning all such interactions poses a significant hurdle for state-of-the-art machine learning frameworks, including large language models (LLMs).To study this problem, we propose a new physical reasoning task and a dataset, dubbed TraySim.Our task involves predicting the dynamics of several objects on a tray that is given an external impact -- the domino effect of the ensued object interactions and their dynamics thus offering a challenging yet controlled setup, with the goal of reasoning being to infer the stability of the objects after the impact.To solve this complex physical reasoning task, we present LLMPhy, a zero-shot black-box optimization framework that leverages the physics knowledge and program synthesis abilities of LLMs, and synergizes these abilities with the world models built into modern physics engines.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, LLMPhy uses an LLM to generate code to iteratively estimate the physical hyperparameters of the system (friction, damping, layout, etc.) <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.648</span></span>via an implicit analysis-by-synthesis approach using a (non-differentiable) simulator in the loop and uses the inferred parameters to imagine the dynamics of the scene towards solving the reasoning task.To show the effectiveness of LLMPhy, we present experiments on our TraySim dataset to predict the steady-state poses of the objects.Our results show that the combination of the LLM and the physics engine leads to state-of-the-art zero-shot physical reasoning performance, while demonstrating superior convergence against standard black-box optimization methods and better estimation of the physical parameters.</p>
