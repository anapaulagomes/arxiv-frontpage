                  <p>Circular-arc graphs are the intersection graphs of arcs of a circle.The main result of this work describes the structure of all \emph{normalized intersection models} of circular-arc graphs.Normalized models of a circular-arc graph reflect the neighborhood relation between its vertices and can be seen as its canonical representations; in particular, any intersection model can be made normalized by possibly extending some of its arcs.We~devise a data-structure, called \emph{PQM-tree}, that maintains the set of all normalized models of a circular-arc graph.We show that the PQM-tree of a circular-arc graph can be computed in linear time.Finally, basing on PQM-trees, we provide a linear-time algorithm for the canonization and the isomorphism problem for circular-arc graphs.   We describe the structure of the normalized models of circular-arc graphs using an approach proposed by Hsu~[\emph{SIAM J. Comput.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>24(3), 411--439, (1995)}]. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.712</span></span>In the aforementioned work, Hsu claimed the construction of decomposition trees representing the set of all normalized intersection models of circular-arc graphs and an $\mathcal{O}(nm)$ time isomorphism algorithm for this class of graphs.However, the counterexample given in~[\emph{Discrete Math.Theor.Comput.Sci., 15(1), 157--182, 2013}] shows that Hsu's isomorphism algorithm is not incorrect.Also, in a companion paper we show that the decomposition trees proposed by Hsu are not constructed correctly; in particular, we showed that there are circular-arc graphs whose all normalized models do not follow the description given by Hsu.</p>

                  <p>Individuals who identify as sexual and gender minorities, including lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and others (LGBTQ+) are more likely to experience poorer health than their heterosexual and cisgender counterparts.One primary source that drives these health disparities is minority stress (i.e., chronic and social stressors unique to LGBTQ+ communities' experiences adapting to the dominant culture).This stress is frequently expressed in LGBTQ+ users' posts on social media platforms.However, these expressions are not just straightforward manifestations of minority stress.They involve linguistic complexity (e.g., idiom or lexical diversity), rendering them challenging for many traditional natural language processing methods to detect.In this work, we designed a hybrid model using Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), a pre-trained deep language model to improve the classification performance of minority stress detection.We experimented with our model on a benchmark social media dataset for minority stress detection (LGBTQ+ MiSSoM+).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset is comprised of 5,789 human-annotated Reddit posts from LGBTQ+ subreddits. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.878</span></span>Our approach enables the extraction of hidden linguistic nuances through pretraining on a vast amount of raw data, while also engaging in transductive learning to jointly develop representations for both labeled training data and unlabeled test data.The RoBERTa-GCN model achieved an accuracy of 0.86 and an F1 score of 0.86, surpassing the performance of other baseline models in predicting LGBTQ+ minority stress.Improved prediction of minority stress expressions on social media could lead to digital health interventions to improve the wellbeing of LGBTQ+ people-a community with high rates of stress-sensitive health problems.</p>

                  <p>Detecting disasters in underground mining, such as explosions and structural damage, has been a persistent challenge over the years.This problem is compounded for first responders, who often have no clear information about the extent or nature of the damage within the mine.The poor-light or even total darkness inside the mines makes rescue efforts incredibly difficult, leading to a tragic loss of life.In this paper, we propose a novel instance segmentation method called DIS-Mine, specifically designed to identify disaster-affected areas within underground mines under low-light or poor visibility conditions, aiding first responders in rescue efforts.DIS-Mine is capable of detecting objects in images, even in complete darkness, by addressing challenges such as high noise, color distortions, and reduced contrast.The key innovations of DIS-Mine are built upon four core components: i) Image brightness improvement, ii) Instance segmentation with SAM integration, iii) Mask R-CNN-based segmentation, and iv) Mask alignment with feature matching.On top of that, we have collected real-world images from an experimental underground mine, introducing a new dataset named ImageMine, specifically gathered in low-visibility conditions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This dataset serves to validate the performance of DIS-Mine in realistic, challenging environments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.769</span></span>Our comprehensive experiments on the ImageMine dataset, as well as on various other datasets demonstrate that DIS-Mine achieves a superior F1 score of 86.0% and mIoU of 72.0%, outperforming state-of-the-art instance segmentation methods, with at least 15x improvement and up to 80% higher precision in object detection.</p>

                  <p>Despite the growing advancements in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models, the development of robust models for underrepresented languages, such as Nepali, remains a challenge.This research focuses on making an exhaustive and generalized dataset followed by fine-tuning OpenAI's Whisper models of different sizes to improve transcription (speech-to-text) accuracy for the Nepali language.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We leverage publicly available ASR datasets and self-recorded custom datasets with a diverse range of accents, dialects, and speaking styles further enriched through augmentation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.749</span></span>Our experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuning Whisper models on our curated custom dataset substantially reduces the Word Error Rate (WER) across all model sizes attributed to larger data variations in terms of speaker's age, gender, and sentiment, acoustic environment, dialect, denser audio segments (15-30 seconds) that are more compatible with Whisper's input, and manual curation of audios and transcriptions.Notably, our approach outperforms Whisper's baseline models trained on Fleur's dataset, achieving WER reductions of up to 36.2% on the small and 23.8% on medium models.Furthermore, we show that data augmentation plays a significant role in enhancing model robustness.Our approach underlines the importance of dataset quality, variation, and augmentation in the adaptation of state-of-the-art models to underrepresented languages for developing accurate ASR systems.</p>

                  <p>Planning with partial observation is a central challenge in embodied AI.A majority of prior works have tackled this challenge by developing agents that physically explore their environment to update their beliefs about the world state.In contrast, humans can $\textit{imagine}$ unseen parts of the world through a mental exploration and $\textit{revise}$ their beliefs with imagined observations.Such updated beliefs can allow them to make more informed decisions, without necessitating the physical exploration of the world at all times.To achieve this human-like ability, we introduce the $\textit{Generative World Explorer (Genex)}$, an egocentric world exploration framework that allows an agent to mentally explore a large-scale 3D world (e.g., urban scenes) and acquire imagined observations to update its belief.This updated belief will then help the agent to make a more informed decision at the current step.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To train $\textit{Genex}$, we create a synthetic urban scene dataset, Genex-DB. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.716</span></span>Our experimental results demonstrate that (1) $\textit{Genex}$ can generate high-quality and consistent observations during long-horizon exploration of a large virtual physical world and (2) the beliefs updated with the generated observations can inform an existing decision-making model (e.g., an LLM agent) to make better plans.</p>

                  <p>Text-to-image diffusion model is a popular paradigm that synthesizes personalized images by providing a text prompt and a random Gaussian noise.While people observe that some noises are ``golden noises'' that can achieve better text-image alignment and higher human preference than others, we still lack a machine learning framework to obtain those golden noises.To learn golden noises for diffusion sampling, we mainly make three contributions in this paper.First, we identify a new concept termed the \textit{noise prompt}, which aims at turning a random Gaussian noise into a golden noise by adding a small desirable perturbation derived from the text prompt.Following the concept, we first formulate the \textit{noise prompt learning} framework that systematically learns ``prompted'' golden noise associated with a text prompt for diffusion models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Second, we design a noise prompt data collection pipeline and collect a large-scale \textit{noise prompt dataset}~(NPD) that contains 100k pairs of random noises and golden noises with the associated text prompts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.838</span></span>With the prepared NPD as the training dataset, we trained a small \textit{noise prompt network}~(NPNet) that can directly learn to transform a random noise into a golden noise.The learned golden noise perturbation can be considered as a kind of prompt for noise, as it is rich in semantic information and tailored to the given text prompt.Third, our extensive experiments demonstrate the impressive effectiveness and generalization of NPNet on improving the quality of synthesized images across various diffusion models, including SDXL, DreamShaper-xl-v2-turbo, and Hunyuan-DiT.Moreover, NPNet is a small and efficient controller that acts as a plug-and-play module with very limited additional inference and computational costs, as it just provides a golden noise instead of a random noise without accessing the original pipeline.</p>

                  <p>Consider the following stochastic matching problem.Given a graph $G=(V, E)$, an unknown subgraph $G_p = (V, E_p)$ is realized where $E_p$ includes every edge of $E$ independently with some probability $p \in (0, 1]$. The goal is to query a sparse subgraph $H$ of $G$, such that the realized edges in $H$ include an approximate maximum matching of $G_p$.   This problem has been studied extensively over the last decade due to its numerous applications in kidney exchange, online dating, and online labor markets.For any fixed $\epsilon > 0$, [BDH STOC'20] showed that any graph $G$ has a subgraph $H$ with $\text{quasipoly}(1/p) = (1/p)^{\text{poly}(\log(1/p))}$ maximum degree, achieving a $(1-\epsilon)$-approximation.A major open question is the best approximation achievable with $\text{poly}(1/p)$-degree subgraphs.A long line of work has progressively improved the approximation in the $\text{poly}(1/p)$-degree regime from .5[BDH+ EC'15] to .501[AKL EC'17], .656<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>[BHFR SODA'19], .666 <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.78</span></span>[AB SOSA'19], .731[BBD SODA'22] (bipartite graphs), and most recently to .68[DS '24].In this work, we show that a $\text{poly}(1/p)$-degree subgraph can obtain a $(1-\epsilon)$-approximation for any desirably small fixed $\epsilon > 0$, achieving the best of both worlds.   Beyond its quantitative improvement, a key conceptual contribution of our work is to connect local computation algorithms (LCAs) to the stochastic matching problem for the first time.While prior work on LCAs mainly focuses on their out-queries (the number of vertices probed to produce the output of a given vertex), our analysis also bounds the in-queries (the number of vertices that probe a given vertex).We prove that the outputs of LCAs with bounded in- and out-queries (in-n-out LCAs for short) have limited correlation, a property that our analysis crucially relies on and might find applications beyond stochastic matchings.</p>

                  <p>When unsure about an answer, humans often respond with more words than necessary, hoping that part of the response will be correct.We observe a similar behavior in large language models (LLMs), which we term "Verbosity Compensation" (VC).VC is harmful because it confuses the user understanding, leading to low efficiency, and influences the LLM services by increasing the latency and cost of generating useless tokens.In this paper, we present the first work that defines and analyzes Verbosity Compensation, explores its causes, and proposes a simple mitigating approach.We define Verbosity Compensation as the behavior of generating responses that can be compressed without information loss when prompted to write concisely.Our experiments, conducted on five datasets of knowledge and reasoning-based QA tasks with 14 newly developed LLMs, reveal three conclusions.1) We reveal a pervasive presence of verbosity compensation across all models and all datasets.Notably, GPT-4 exhibits a VC frequency of 50.40%.2)We reveal the large performance gap between verbose and concise responses, with a notable difference of 27.61% on the Qasper dataset.We also demonstrate that this difference does not naturally diminish as LLM capability increases.Both 1) and 2) highlight the urgent need to mitigate the frequency of VC behavior and disentangle verbosity with veracity.We propose a simple yet effective cascade algorithm that replaces the verbose responses with the other model-generated responses.The results show that our approach effectively alleviates the VC of the Mistral model from 63.81% to 16.16% on the Qasper dataset.3) We also find that verbose responses exhibit higher uncertainty across all five datasets, suggesting a strong connection between verbosity and model uncertainty.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our dataset and code are available at https://github.com/psunlpgroup/VerbosityLLM. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.837</span></span></p>

                  <p>In real-world NLP applications, Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising solutions due to their extensive training on vast datasets.However, the large size and high computation demands of LLMs limit their practicality in many applications, especially when further fine-tuning is required.To address these limitations, smaller models are typically preferred for deployment.However, their training is hindered by the scarcity of labeled data.In contrast, unlabeled data is often readily which can be leveraged by using LLMs to generate pseudo-labels for training smaller models.This enables the smaller models (student) to acquire knowledge from LLMs(teacher) while reducing computational costs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This process introduces challenges, such as potential noisy pseudo-labels. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.612</span></span>Selecting high-quality and informative data is therefore critical to enhance model performance while improving the efficiency of data utilization.To address this, we propose LLKD that enables Learning with Less computational resources and less data for Knowledge Distillation from LLMs.LLKD is an adaptive sample selection method that incorporates signals from both the teacher and student.Specifically, it prioritizes samples where the teacher demonstrates high confidence in its labeling, indicating reliable labels, and where the student exhibits a high information need, identifying challenging samples that require further learning.Our comprehensive experiments show that LLKD achieves superior performance across various datasets with higher data efficiency.</p>

                  <p>Characterizing the computational power of neural network architectures in terms of formal language theory remains a crucial line of research, as it describes lower and upper bounds on the reasoning capabilities of modern AI.However, when empirically testing these bounds, existing work often leaves a discrepancy between experiments and the formal claims they are meant to support.The problem is that formal language theory pertains specifically to recognizers: machines that receive a string as input and classify whether it belongs to a language.On the other hand, it is common to instead use proxy tasks that are similar in only an informal sense, such as language modeling or sequence-to-sequence transduction.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We correct this mismatch by training and evaluating neural networks directly as binary classifiers of strings, using a general method that can be applied to a wide variety of languages. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span>As part of this, we extend an algorithm recently proposed by Sn{\ae}bjarnarson et al.

                  <p>Many software engineering maintenance tasks require linking a commit that induced a bug with the commit that later fixed that bug.Several existing SZZ algorithms provide a way to identify the potential commit that induced a bug when given a fixing commit as input.Prior work introduced the notion of a "work item", a logical grouping of commits that could be a single unit of work.Our key insight in this work is to recognize that a bug-inducing commit and the fix(es) for that bug together represent a "work item."It is not currently understood how these work items, which are logical groups of revisions addressing a single issue or feature, could impact the performance of algorithms such as SZZ.In this paper, we propose a heuristic that, given an input commit, uses information about changed methods to identify related commits that form a work item with the input commit.We hypothesize that given such a work item identifying heuristic, we can identify bug-inducing commits more accurately than existing SZZ approaches.We then build a new variant of SZZ that we call Work Item Aware SZZ (WIA-SZZ), that leverages our work item detecting heuristic to first suggest bug-inducing commits.If our heuristic fails to find any candidates, we then fall back to baseline variants of SZZ.We conduct a manual evaluation to assess the accuracy of our heuristic to identify work items.Our evaluation reveals the heuristic is 64% accurate in finding work items, but most importantly it is able to find many bug-inducing commits.We then evaluate our approach on 821 repositories that have been previously used to study the performance of SZZ, comparing our work against six SZZ variants.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>That evaluation shows an improvement in F1 scores ranging from 2% to 9%, or when looking only at the subset of cases that found work item improved 3% to 14%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.653</span></span></p>

                  <p>In recent years, the rapid growth of security vulnerabilities poses great challenges to tracing and managing them.For example, it was reported that the NVD database experienced significant delays due to the shortage of maintainers.Such delay creates challenges for third-party security personnel (e.g., administrators) to trace the information related to the CVE.To help security personnel trace a vulnerability patch, we build a retrieval system that automatically retrieves the patch in the repository.   Inspired by existing work on explainable machine learning, we ask the following research question: can explanations help security maintainers make decisions in patch tracing?First, we investigate using LIME (a widely used explainable machine learning method) to highlight the rationale tokens in the commit message and code.In addition, we propose an explanation method called TfIdf-Highlight, which leverages the Tf-Idf statistics to select the most informative words in the repository and the dataset.We evaluate the effectiveness of highlighting using two experiments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>First, we compare LIME and TfIdf-Highlight using a faithfulness score (i.e., sufficiency and comprehensiveness) defined for ranking. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.619</span></span>We find that TfIdf-Highlight significantly outperforms LIME's sufficiency scores by 15\% and slightly outperforms the comprehensiveness scores.Second, we conduct a blind human labeling experiment by asking the annotators to guess the patch under 3 settings (TfIdf-Highlight, LIME, and no highlight).We find that the helpfulness score for TfIdf-Highlight is higher than LIME while the labeling accuracies of LIME and TfIdf-Highlight are similar.Nevertheless, highlighting does not improve the accuracy over non-highlighting.</p>

                  <p>While general-purpose computing follows Von Neumann's architecture, the data movement between memory and processor elements dictates the processor's performance.The evolving compute-in-memory (CiM) paradigm tackles this issue by facilitating simultaneous processing and storage within static random-access memory (SRAM) elements.Numerous design decisions taken at different levels of hierarchy affect the figure of merits (FoMs) of SRAM, such as power, performance, area, and yield.The absence of a rapid assessment mechanism for the impact of changes at different hierarchy levels on global FoMs poses a challenge to accurately evaluating innovative SRAM designs.This paper presents an automation tool designed to optimize the energy and latency of SRAM designs incorporating diverse implementation strategies for executing logic operations within the SRAM.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The tool structure allows easy comparison across different array topologies and various design strategies to result in energy-efficient implementations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.632</span></span>Our study involves a comprehensive comparison of over 6900+ distinct design implementation strategies for EPFL combinational benchmark circuits on the energy-recycling resonant compute-in-memory (rCiM) architecture designed using TSMC 28 nm technology.When provided with a combinational circuit, the tool aims to generate an energy-efficient implementation strategy tailored to the specified input memory and latency constraints.The tool reduces 80.9% of energy consumption on average across all benchmarks while using the six-topology implementation compared to baseline implementation of single-macro topology by considering the parallel processing capability of rCiM cache size ranging from 4KB to 192KB.</p>

                  <p>By augmenting Large Language Models (LLMs) with external tools, their capacity to solve complex problems has been significantly enhanced.However, despite ongoing advancements in the parsing capabilities of LLMs, incorporating all available tools simultaneously in the prompt remains impractical due to the vast number of external tools.Consequently, it is essential to provide LLMs with a precise set of tools tailored to the specific task, considering both quantity and quality.Current tool retrieval methods primarily focus on refining the ranking list of tools and directly packaging a fixed number of top-ranked tools as the tool set.However, these approaches often fail to equip LLMs with the optimal set of tools prior to execution, since the optimal number of tools for different tasks could be different, resulting in inefficiencies such as redundant or unsuitable tools, which impede immediate access to the most relevant tools.This paper addresses the challenge of recommending precise toolsets for LLMs.We introduce the problem of tool recommendation, define its scope, and propose a novel Precision-driven Tool Recommendation (PTR) approach.PTR captures an initial, concise set of tools by leveraging historical tool bundle usage and dynamically adjusts the tool set by performing tool matching, culminating in a multi-view-based tool addition.Additionally, we present a new dataset, RecTools, and a metric, TRACC, designed to evaluate the effectiveness of tool recommendation for LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We further validate our design choices through comprehensive experiments, demonstrating promising accuracy across two open benchmarks and our RecTools dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.639</span></span></p>

                  <p>Emerging Large Language Model (LLM) applications require long input prompts to perform complex downstream tasks like document analysis and code generation.For these long context length applications, the length of the input prompt poses a significant challenge in terms of inference efficiency since the inference costs increase linearly with sequence length.However, for many of these applications, much of the context in the prompt is fixed across different user inputs, thereby providing the opportunity to perform offline optimizations to process user inputs quickly, as they are received.In this work, we propose Squeezed Attention as a mechanism to accelerate LLM applications where a large portion of the input prompt is fixed.We first leverage K-means clustering offline to group the keys for the fixed context based on semantic similarity and represent each cluster with a single centroid value.During inference, we compare query tokens from the user input with the centroids to predict which of the keys from the fixed context are semantically relevant and need to be loaded during inference.We then compute exact attention using only these important keys from the fixed context, thereby reducing bandwidth and computational costs.We also extend our method to use a hierarchical centroid lookup to identify important keys, which can reduce the complexity of attention from linear to logarithmic with respect to the context length.We implement optimized Triton kernels for centroid comparison and sparse FlashAttention with important keys, achieving more than 4x speedups during both the prefill and generation phases for long-context inference.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we have extensively evaluated our method on various long-context benchmarks including LongBench, where it achieves a 3x reduction in KV cache budget without accuracy loss and up to an 8x reduction with <0.5 point accuracy gap for various models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.667</span></span></p>

                  <p>Circular-arc graphs are the intersection graphs of arcs of a circle.The main result of this work describes the structure of all \emph{normalized intersection models} of circular-arc graphs.Normalized models of a circular-arc graph reflect the neighborhood relation between its vertices and can be seen as its canonical representations; in particular, any intersection model can be made normalized by possibly extending some of its arcs.We~devise a data-structure, called \emph{PQM-tree}, that maintains the set of all normalized models of a circular-arc graph.We show that the PQM-tree of a circular-arc graph can be computed in linear time.Finally, basing on PQM-trees, we provide a linear-time algorithm for the canonization and the isomorphism problem for circular-arc graphs.   We describe the structure of the normalized models of circular-arc graphs using an approach proposed by Hsu~[\emph{SIAM J. Comput.24(3), 411--439, (1995)}].In the aforementioned work, Hsu claimed the construction of decomposition trees representing the set of all normalized intersection models of circular-arc graphs and an $\mathcal{O}(nm)$ time isomorphism algorithm for this class of graphs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, the counterexample given in~[\emph{Discrete Math. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span>Theor.Comput.Sci., 15(1), 157--182, 2013}] shows that Hsu's isomorphism algorithm is not incorrect.Also, in a companion paper we show that the decomposition trees proposed by Hsu are not constructed correctly; in particular, we showed that there are circular-arc graphs whose all normalized models do not follow the description given by Hsu.</p>

As we advance towards constructing compound AI inference pipelines that integrate multiple large language models (LLMs), the attack surfaces expand significantly.Attackers now focus on the AI algorithms as well as the software and hardware components associated with these systems.While current research often examines these elements in isolation, we find that combining cross-layer attack observations can enable powerful end-to-end attacks with minimal assumptions about the threat model.Given, the sheer number of existing attacks at each layer, we need a holistic and systemized understanding of different attack vectors at each layer.   This SoK discusses different software and hardware attacks applicable to compound AI systems and demonstrates how combining multiple attack mechanisms can reduce the threat model assumptions required for an isolated attack.Next, we systematize the ML attacks in lines with the Mitre Att&ck framework to better position each attack based on the threat model.Finally, we outline the existing countermeasures for both software and hardware layers and discuss the necessity of a comprehensive defense strategy to enable the secure and high-performance deployment of compound AI systems.</p>
