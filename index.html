                  <p>Learning effective deep portrait matting models requires training data of both high quality and large quantity.Neither quality nor quantity can be easily met for portrait matting, however.Since the most accurate ground-truth portrait mattes are acquired in front of the green screen, it is almost impossible to harvest a large-scale portrait matting dataset in reality.This work shows that one can leverage text prompts and the recent Layer Diffusion model to generate high-quality portrait foregrounds and extract latent portrait mattes.However, the portrait mattes cannot be readily in use due to significant generation artifacts.Inspired by the connectivity priors observed in portrait images, that is, the border of portrait foregrounds always appears connected, a connectivity-aware approach is introduced to refine portrait mattes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Building on this, a large-scale portrait matting dataset is created, termed LD-Portrait-20K, with $20,051$ portrait foregrounds and high-quality alpha mattes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.926</span></span>Extensive experiments demonstrated the value of the LD-Portrait-20K dataset, with models trained on it significantly outperforming those trained on other datasets.In addition, comparisons with the chroma keying algorithm and an ablation study on dataset capacity further confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed matte creation approach.Further, the dataset also contributes to state-of-the-art video portrait matting, implemented by simple video segmentation and a trimap-based image matting model trained on this dataset.</p>

                  <p>Fixing Python dependency issues is a tedious and error-prone task for developers, who must manually identify and resolve environment dependencies and version constraints of third-party modules and Python interpreters.Researchers have attempted to automate this process by relying on large knowledge graphs and database lookup tables.However, these traditional approaches face limitations due to the variety of dependency error types, large sets of possible module versions, and conflicts among transitive dependencies.This study explores the potential of using large language models (LLMs) to automatically fix dependency issues in Python programs.We introduce PLLM (pronounced "plum"), a novel technique that employs retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to help an LLM infer Python versions and required modules for a given Python file.PLLM builds a testing environment that iteratively (1) prompts the LLM for module combinations, (2) tests the suggested changes, and (3) provides feedback (error messages) to the LLM to refine the fix.This feedback cycle leverages natural language processing (NLP) to intelligently parse and interpret build error messages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We benchmark PLLM on the Gistable HG2.9K dataset, a collection of challenging single-file Python gists. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.781</span></span>We compare PLLM against two state-of-the-art automatic dependency inference approaches, namely PyEGo and ReadPyE, w.r.t.the ability to resolve dependency issues.Our results indicate that PLLM can fix more dependency issues than the two baselines, with +218 (+15.97%) more fixes over ReadPyE and +281 (+21.58%) over PyEGo.Our deeper analyses suggest that PLLM is particularly beneficial for projects with many dependencies and for specific third-party numerical and machine-learning modules.Our findings demonstrate the potential of LLM-based approaches to iteratively resolve Python dependency issues.</p>

                  <p>Deep neural networks are increasingly employed in high-stakes medical applications, despite their tendency for shortcut learning in the presence of spurious correlations, which can have potentially fatal consequences in practice.Detecting and mitigating shortcut behavior is a challenging task that often requires significant labeling efforts from domain experts.To alleviate this problem, we introduce a semi-automated framework for the identification of spurious behavior from both data and model perspective by leveraging insights from eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI).This allows the retrieval of spurious data points and the detection of model circuits that encode the associated prediction rules.Moreover, we demonstrate how these shortcut encodings can be used for XAI-based sample- and pixel-level data annotation, providing valuable information for bias mitigation methods to unlearn the undesired shortcut behavior.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We show the applicability of our framework using four medical datasets across two modalities, featuring controlled and real-world spurious correlations caused by data artifacts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.749</span></span>We successfully identify and mitigate these biases in VGG16, ResNet50, and contemporary Vision Transformer models, ultimately increasing their robustness and applicability for real-world medical tasks.</p>

                  <p>Recent large language models (LLMs) have advanced table understanding capabilities but rely on converting tables into text sequences.While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable direct visual processing, they face limitations in handling scientific tables due to fixed input image resolutions and insufficient numerical reasoning capabilities.We present a comprehensive framework for multimodal scientific table understanding and reasoning with dynamic input image resolutions.Our framework consists of three key components: (1) MMSci-Pre, a domain-specific table structure learning dataset of 52K scientific table structure recognition samples, (2) MMSci-Ins, an instruction tuning dataset with 12K samples across three table-based tasks, and (3) MMSci-Eval, a benchmark with 3,114 testing samples specifically designed to evaluate numerical reasoning capabilities.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our domain-specific approach with 52K scientific table images achieves superior performance compared to 150K general-domain tables, highlighting the importance of data quality over quantity.Our proposed table-based MLLMs with dynamic input resolutions show significant improvements in both general table understanding and numerical reasoning capabilities, with strong generalisation to held-out datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/Bernard-Yang/MMSci_Table. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.721</span></span></p>

                  <p>Identifying anatomical landmarks in 3D dental models is crucial for orthodontic treatment.Manually placing these key points is complex, time-consuming, and requires expert knowledge.While some machine learning methods have been proposed for automatic tooth landmark detection in 3D Intraoral Scans (IOS), research remains limited, with no fully end-to-end approaches that avoid teeth segmentation.   We propose CHaRNet (Conditioned Heatmap Regression Network), the first end-to-end deep learning method for tooth landmark detection in 3D IOS.Unlike traditional two-stage methods that segment teeth before detecting landmarks, CHaRNet directly detects landmarks on the input point cloud.It consists of four key modules: (1) a point cloud encoder, (2) a point cloud decoder with a heatmap regression head, (3) a teeth presence classification head, and (4) the innovative Conditioned Heatmap Regression (CHaR) module.The CHaR module refines landmark regression by leveraging teeth presence classification, enabling dynamic adaptation to cases with missing teeth and improving accuracy in complex dental models.   We evaluate CHaRNet using five point cloud learning algorithms to validate the effectiveness of the CHaR module and test it on a clinical dataset of $1,214$ annotated 3D dental models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Both the dataset and code will be publicly released to address the lack of open datasets in orthodontics, promote benchmarking, and inspire new research.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.712</span></span>CHaRNet achieves a Mean Euclidean Distance Error (MEDE) of 1.28 mm and a Mean Success Ratio (MSR) of 82.40\%, demonstrating robust performance.Notably, it excels in handling irregular dental geometries, such as models with missing teeth.This end-to-end approach streamlines orthodontic workflows, improves 3D IOS analysis precision, and facilitates efficient computer-assisted treatment planning.</p>

                  <p>Purpose: Surgical workflow analysis is crucial for improving surgical efficiency and safety.However, previous studies rely heavily on large-scale annotated datasets, posing challenges in cost, scalability, and reliance on expert annotations.To address this, we propose Surg-FTDA (Few-shot Text-driven Adaptation), designed to handle various surgical workflow analysis tasks with minimal paired image-label data.   Methods: Our approach has two key components.First, Few-shot selection-based modality alignment selects a small subset of images and aligns their embeddings with text embeddings from the downstream task, bridging the modality gap.Second, Text-driven adaptation leverages only text data to train a decoder, eliminating the need for paired image-text data.This decoder is then applied to aligned image embeddings, enabling image-related tasks without explicit image-text pairs.   Results: We evaluate our approach to generative tasks (image captioning) and discriminative tasks (triplet recognition and phase recognition).Results show that Surg-FTDA outperforms baselines and generalizes well across downstream tasks.   Conclusion: We propose a text-driven adaptation approach that mitigates the modality gap and handles multiple downstream tasks in surgical workflow analysis, with minimal reliance on large annotated datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code and dataset will be released in https://github.com/TingxuanSix/Surg-FTDA. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.85</span></span></p>

                  <p>The $r$-neighbourhood complexity of a graph $G$ is the function counting, for a given integer $k$, the largest possible number, over all vertex-subsets $A$ of size $k$, of subsets of $A$ realized as the intersection between the $r$-neighbourhood of some vertex and $A$.A refinement of this notion is the $r$-profile complexity, that counts the maximum number of distinct distance-vectors from any vertex to the vertices of $A$, ignoring distances larger than $r$. Typically, in structured graph classes such as graphs of bounded VC-dimension or chordal graphs, these functions are bounded, leading to insights into their structural properties and efficient algorithms.   We improve existing bounds on the $r$-profile complexity (and thus on the $r$-neighbourhood complexity) for graphs in several structured graph classes.We show that the $r$-profile complexity of graphs excluding $K_h$ as a minor is in $O_h(r^{3h-3}k)$. For graphs of treewidth at most $t$ we give a bound in $O_t(r^{t+1}k)$, which is tight up to a function of $t$ as a factor.These bounds improve results and answer a question of Joret and Rambaud<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>[Combinatorica, 2024].    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.702</span></span>For outerplanar graphs, we can improve our treewidth bound by a factor of $r$ and conjecture that a similar improvement holds for graphs with bounded simple treewidth.For graphs of treelength at most $\ell$, we give the upper bound in $O(k(r^2(\ell+1)^k))$.   Our bounds also imply relations between the order, diameter and metric dimension of graphs in these classes, improving results from [Beaudou et al., SIDMA 2017].</p>

                  <p>Localizing text descriptions in large-scale 3D scenes is inherently an ambiguous task.This nonetheless arises while describing general concepts, e.g. all traffic lights in a city.   To facilitate reasoning based on such concepts, text localization in the form of distribution is required.In this paper, we generate the distribution of the camera poses conditioned upon the textual description.   To facilitate such generation, we propose a diffusion-based architecture that conditionally diffuses the noisy 6DoF camera poses to their plausible locations.   The conditional signals are derived from the text descriptions, using the pre-trained text encoders.The connection between text descriptions and pose distribution is established through pretrained Vision-Language-Model, i.e. CLIP.Furthermore, we demonstrate that the candidate poses for the distribution can be further refined by rendering potential poses using 3D Gaussian splatting, guiding incorrectly posed samples towards locations that better align with the textual description, through visual reasoning.   We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by comparing it with both standard retrieval methods and learning-based approaches.Our proposed method consistently outperforms these baselines across all five large-scale datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our source code and dataset will be made publicly available. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.927</span></span></p>

                  <p>Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification aims at categorizing each pixel in an HSI into a specific land cover class, which is crucial for applications like remote sensing, environmental monitoring, and agriculture.Although deep learning-based HSI classification methods have achieved significant advancements, existing methods still rely on manually labeled data for training, which is both time-consuming and labor-intensive.To address this limitation, we introduce a novel zero-shot hyperspectral image classification framework based on CLIP (SPECIAL), aiming to eliminate the need for manual annotations.The SPECIAL framework consists of two main stages: (1) CLIP-based pseudo-label generation, and (2) noisy label learning.In the first stage, HSI is spectrally interpolated to produce RGB bands.These bands are subsequently classified using CLIP, resulting in noisy pseudo-labels that are accompanied by confidence scores.To improve the quality of these labels, we propose a scaling strategy that fuses predictions from multiple spatial scales.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In the second stage, spectral information and a label refinement technique are incorporated to mitigate label noise and further enhance classification accuracy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.625</span></span>Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our SPECIAL outperforms existing methods in zero-shot HSI classification, showing its potential for more practical applications.The code is available at https://github.com/LiPang/SPECIAL.</p>

                  <p>As one of the most promising methods in self-supervised learning, contrastive learning has achieved a series of breakthroughs across numerous fields.A predominant approach to implementing contrastive learning is applying InfoNCE loss: By capturing the similarities between pairs, InfoNCE loss enables learning the representation of data.Albeit its success, adopting InfoNCE loss requires tuning a temperature, which is a core hyperparameter for calibrating similarity scores.Despite its significance and sensitivity to performance being emphasized by several studies, searching for a valid temperature requires extensive trial-and-error-based experiments, which increases the difficulty of adopting InfoNCE loss.To address this difficulty, we propose a novel method to deploy InfoNCE loss without temperature.Specifically, we replace temperature scaling with the inverse hyperbolic tangent function, resulting in a modified InfoNCE loss.In addition to hyperparameter-free deployment, we observed that the proposed method even yielded a performance gain in contrastive learning.Our detailed theoretical analysis discovers that the current practice of temperature scaling in InfoNCE loss causes serious problems in gradient descent, whereas our method provides desirable gradient properties.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The proposed method was validated on five benchmarks on contrastive learning, yielding satisfactory results without temperature tuning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span></p>

                  <p>Face animation is a challenging task.Existing model-based methods (utilizing 3DMMs or landmarks) often result in a model-like reconstruction effect, which doesn't effectively preserve identity.Conversely, model-free approaches face challenges in attaining a decoupled and semantically rich feature space, thereby making accurate motion transfer difficult to achieve.We introduce the semantic facial descriptors in learnable disentangled vector space to address the dilemma.The approach involves decoupling the facial space into identity and motion subspaces while endowing each of them with semantics by learning complete orthogonal basis vectors.We obtain basis vector coefficients by employing an encoder on the source and driving faces, leading to effective facial descriptors in the identity and motion subspaces.Ultimately, these descriptors can be recombined as latent codes to animate faces.Our approach successfully addresses the issue of model-based methods' limitations in high-fidelity identity and the challenges faced by model-free methods in accurate motion transfer.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments are conducted on three challenging benchmarks (i.e. VoxCeleb, HDTF, CelebV). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.622</span></span>Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that our model outperforms SOTA methods with superior identity preservation and motion transfer.</p>

                  <p>The Isolation Forest (iForest), proposed by Liu, Ting, and Zhou at TKDE 2012, has become a prominent tool for unsupervised anomaly detection.However, recent research by Hariri, Kind, and Brunner, published in TKDE 2021, has revealed issues with iForest.They identified the presence of axis-aligned ghost clusters that can be misidentified as normal clusters, leading to biased anomaly scores and inaccurate predictions.In response, they developed the Extended Isolation Forest (EIF), which effectively solves these issues by eliminating the ghost clusters introduced by iForest.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This enhancement results in improved consistency of anomaly scores and superior performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span>We reveal a previously overlooked problem in the Extended Isolation Forest (EIF), showing that it is vulnerable to ghost inter-clusters between normal clusters of data points.In this paper, we introduce the Rotated Isolation Forest (RIF) algorithm which effectively addresses both the axis-aligned ghost clusters observed in iForest and the ghost inter-clusters seen in EIF.RIF accomplishes this by randomly rotating the dataset (using random rotation matrices and QR decomposition) before feeding it into the iForest construction, thereby increasing dataset variation and eliminating ghost clusters.Our experiments conclusively demonstrate that the RIF algorithm outperforms iForest and EIF, as evidenced by the results obtained from both synthetic datasets and real-world datasets.</p>

We fill this gap in the literature by conducting a formal runtime analysis of the cGA on LeadingOnes.For the cGA's single parameter -- called the hypothetical population size -- at least polylogarithmically larger than the problem size, we prove that the cGA samples the optimum of LeadingOnes with high probability within a number of function evaluations quasi-linear in the problem size and linear in the hypothetical population size.For the best hypothetical population size, our result matches, up to polylogarithmic factors, the typical quadratic runtime that many randomized search heuristics exhibit on LeadingOnes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our analysis exhibits some noteworthy differences in the working principles of the two algorithms which were not visible in previous works. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.691</span></span></p>

                  <p>Accurate prediction of mobile traffic, \textit{i.e.,} network traffic from cellular base stations, is crucial for optimizing network performance and supporting urban development.However, the non-stationary nature of mobile traffic, driven by human activity and environmental changes, leads to both regular patterns and abrupt variations.Diffusion models excel in capturing such complex temporal dynamics due to their ability to capture the inherent uncertainties.Most existing approaches prioritize designing novel denoising networks but often neglect the critical role of noise itself, potentially leading to sub-optimal performance.In this paper, we introduce a novel perspective by emphasizing the role of noise in the denoising process.Our analysis reveals that noise fundamentally shapes mobile traffic predictions, exhibiting distinct and consistent patterns.We propose NPDiff, a framework that decomposes noise into \textit{prior} and \textit{residual} components, with the \textit{prior} derived from data dynamics, enhancing the model's ability to capture both regular and abrupt variations.NPDiff can seamlessly integrate with various diffusion-based prediction models, delivering predictions that are effective, efficient, and robust.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments demonstrate that it achieves superior performance with an improvement over 30\%, offering a new perspective on leveraging diffusion models in this domain. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.629</span></span></p>

                  <p>Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize novel compositions of attributes and objects by leveraging knowledge learned from seen compositions.Recent approaches have explored the use of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to align textual and visual modalities.These methods typically employ prompt engineering, parameter-tuning, and modality fusion to generate rich textual prototypes that serve as class prototypes for CZSL.However, the modality gap results in textual prototypes being unable to fully capture the optimal representations of all class prototypes, particularly those with fine-grained features, which can be directly obtained from the visual modality.In this paper, we propose a novel Dual-Modal Prototype Joint Learning framework for the CZSL task.Our approach, based on VLMs, introduces prototypes in both the textual and visual modalities.The textual prototype is optimized to capture broad conceptual information, aiding the model's generalization across unseen compositions.Meanwhile, the visual prototype is used to mitigate the classification errors caused by the modality gap and capture fine-grained details to distinguish images with similar appearances.To effectively optimize these prototypes, we design specialized decomposition modules and a joint learning strategy that enrich the features from both modalities.These prototypes not only capture key category information during training but also serve as crucial reference targets during inference.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in the closed-world setting and competitive performance in the open-world setting across three publicly available CZSL benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.612</span></span>These findings validate the effectiveness of our method in advancing compositional generalization.</p>

                  <p>Test-time adaptation (TTA) has demonstrated significant potential in addressing distribution shifts between training and testing data.Open-set test-time adaptation (OSTTA) aims to adapt a source pre-trained model online to an unlabeled target domain that contains unknown classes.This task becomes more challenging when multiple modalities are involved.Existing methods have primarily focused on unimodal OSTTA, often filtering out low-confidence samples without addressing the complexities of multimodal data.In this work, we present Adaptive Entropy-aware Optimization (AEO), a novel framework specifically designed to tackle Multimodal Open-set Test-time Adaptation (MM-OSTTA) for the first time.Our analysis shows that the entropy difference between known and unknown samples in the target domain strongly correlates with MM-OSTTA performance.To leverage this, we propose two key components: Unknown-aware Adaptive Entropy Optimization (UAE) and Adaptive Modality Prediction Discrepancy Optimization (AMP).These components enhance the ability of model to distinguish unknown class samples during online adaptation by amplifying the entropy difference between known and unknown samples.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To thoroughly evaluate our proposed methods in the MM-OSTTA setting, we establish a new benchmark derived from existing datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.63</span></span>This benchmark includes two downstream tasks and incorporates five modalities.Extensive experiments across various domain shift situations demonstrate the efficacy and versatility of the AEO framework.Additionally, we highlight the strong performance of AEO in long-term and continual MM-OSTTA settings, both of which are challenging and highly relevant to real-world applications.Our source code is available at https://github.com/donghao51/AEO.</p>

That is, strong polarization continues to hold under the min-sum approximation.Conversely, for code rates exceeding $R_{\mathrm{U}}$, the error probability approaches $1$ as the code-length increases, irrespective of which bits are frozen.We show that $0 < R_{\mathrm{L}} \leq R_{\mathrm{U}} \leq C$, where $C$ is the channel capacity.The last inequality is often strict, in which case the ramification of using the min-sum approximation is that we can no longer achieve capacity.</p>

                  <p>Diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as promising approaches for sequential recommendation due to their strong ability to model data distributions and generate high-quality items.Existing work typically adds noise to the next item and progressively denoises it guided by the user's interaction sequence, generating items that closely align with user interests.However, we identify two key issues in this paradigm.First, the sequences are often heterogeneous in length and content, exhibiting noise due to stochastic user behaviors.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Using such sequences as guidance may hinder DMs from accurately understanding user interests. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.624</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Second, DMs are prone to data bias and tend to generate only the popular items that dominate the training dataset, thus failing to meet the personalized needs of different users. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.673</span></span>To address these issues, we propose Distinguished Quantized Guidance for Diffusion-based Sequence Recommendation (DiQDiff), which aims to extract robust guidance to understand user interests and generate distinguished items for personalized user interests within DMs.To extract robust guidance, DiQDiff introduces Semantic Vector Quantization (SVQ) to quantize sequences into semantic vectors (e.g., collaborative signals and category interests) using a codebook, which can enrich the guidance to better understand user interests.To generate distinguished items, DiQDiff personalizes the generation through Contrastive Discrepancy Maximization (CDM), which maximizes the distance between denoising trajectories using contrastive loss to prevent biased generation for different users.Extensive experiments are conducted to compare DiQDiff with multiple baseline models across four widely-used datasets.The superior recommendation performance of DiQDiff against leading approaches demonstrates its effectiveness in sequential recommendation tasks.</p>

                  <p>The Battery-Free Internet of Things might revolutionize our understanding of connected devices, which harvest their operational energy from the environment (e.g., using solar cells).These systems come with the major system-software challenge that the intermittently-powered IoT devices have to checkpoint their state in non-volatile memory to later resume operation with this state when sufficient energy is available.The scarce energy resources demand that only modified data is persisted to non-volatile memory before a power failure, which requires precise modification-tracking.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we present the first virtually Non-Volatile Heap (vNV-Heap) abstraction for intermittently-powered systems with guaranteed power-failure resilience and non-volatile memory safety (analogous to memory-safety for RAM). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.627</span></span>The heap exploits ownership systems, a zero-cost (i.e., compile-time) abstraction for example implemented by Rust, to track modifications and virtualize object-persistence.To achieve power-failure resilience, our heap is designed and implemented to guarantee bounded operations by static program code analysis: As an example, the heap allows for determining a worst-case energy consumption for the operation of persisting modified and currently volatile objects.Our evaluations with our open-source implementation on an embedded hardware platform (i.e., ESP32-C3) shows that using our heap abstraction is more energy-efficient than existing approaches, while also providing runtime guarantees by static worst-case analysis bounds.</p>

                  <p><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper analyses how software developers elicit explainability requirements when creating a software application with an AI component, through a case study using AI in the medical context of predicting cerebral palsy (CP) risk in infants. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span>Following a small software development team at a Norwegian hospital, we observe their process of simultaneously developing the AI application and discovering what explanations clinicians require from the AI predictions.Since clinicians struggled to articulate their explainability needs before interacting with the system, an iterative approach proved effective: the team started with minimal explanations and refined these based on clinicians' responses during real patient examinations.Our preliminary findings from the first two iterations show that clinicians valued "interrogative explanations" - i.e., tools that let them explore and compare the AI predictions with their own assessments - over detailed technical explanations of the AI model's inner workings.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Based on our analysis, we suggest that successful explainability requirements emerge through iterative collaboration between developers and users rather than being fully specified upfront. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.664</span></span>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first empirical case study on eliciting explainability requirements in software engineering.</p>
