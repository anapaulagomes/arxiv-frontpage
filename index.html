                  <p>Increasingly more research areas rely on machine learning methods to accelerate discovery while saving resources.Machine learning models, however, usually require large datasets of experimental or computational results, which in certain fields, such as (bio)chemistry, materials science, or medicine, are rarely given and often prohibitively expensive to obtain.To bypass that obstacle, active learning methods are employed to develop machine learning models with a desired performance while requiring the least possible number of computational or experimental results from the domain of application.For this purpose, the model's knowledge about certain regions of the application domain is estimated to guide the choice of the model's training set.Although active learning is widely studied for classification problems (discrete outcomes), comparatively few works handle this method for regression problems (continuous outcomes).In this work, we present our Python package regAL, which allows users to evaluate different active learning strategies for regression problems.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>With a minimal input of just the dataset in question, but many additional customization and insight options, this package is intended for anyone who aims to perform and understand active learning in their problem-specific scope. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.712</span></span></p>

                  <p>Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a powerful approach to align text-to-image (T2I) models with human feedback.Unfortunately, successful application of DPO to T2I models requires a huge amount of resources to collect and label large-scale datasets, e.g., millions of generated paired images annotated with human preferences.In addition, these human preference datasets can get outdated quickly as the rapid improvements of T2I models lead to higher quality images.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we investigate a scalable approach for collecting large-scale and fully synthetic datasets for DPO training. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.738</span></span>Specifically, the preferences for paired images are generated using a pre-trained reward function, eliminating the need for involving humans in the annotation process, greatly improving the dataset collection efficiency.Moreover, we demonstrate that such datasets allow averaging predictions across multiple models and collecting ranked preferences as opposed to pairwise preferences.Furthermore, we introduce RankDPO to enhance DPO-based methods using the ranking feedback.Applying RankDPO on SDXL and SD3-Medium models with our synthetically generated preference dataset ``Syn-Pic'' improves both prompt-following (on benchmarks like T2I-Compbench, GenEval, and DPG-Bench) and visual quality (through user studies).This pipeline presents a practical and scalable solution to develop better preference datasets to enhance the performance of text-to-image models.</p>

In this paper, we tackle this problem by introducing a "Cultural Context Schema" for conversations.It comprises (1) conversational information such as emotions, dialogue acts, etc., and (2) cultural information such as social norms, violations, etc.We generate ~110k social norm and violation descriptions for ~23k conversations from Chinese culture using LLMs.We refine them using automated verification strategies which are evaluated against culturally aware human judgements.We organize these descriptions into meaningful structures we call "Norm Concepts", using an interactive human-in-loop framework.We ground the norm concepts and the descriptions in conversations using symbolic annotation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we use the obtained dataset for downstream tasks such as emotion, sentiment, and dialogue act detection. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.736</span></span>We show that it significantly improves the empirical performance.</p>

                  <p>In this paper, we tackle the problem of how to build and benchmark a large motion model (LMM).The ultimate goal of LMM is to serve as a foundation model for versatile motion-related tasks, e.g., human motion generation, with interpretability and generalizability.Though advanced, recent LMM-related works are still limited by small-scale motion data and costly text descriptions.Besides, previous motion benchmarks primarily focus on pure body movements, neglecting the ubiquitous motions in context, i.e., humans interacting with humans, objects, and scenes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address these limitations, we consolidate large-scale video action datasets as knowledge banks to build MotionBank, which comprises 13 video action datasets, 1.24M motion sequences, and 132.9M frames of natural and diverse human motions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.819</span></span>Different from laboratory-captured motions, in-the-wild human-centric videos contain abundant motions in context.To facilitate better motion text alignment, we also meticulously devise a motion caption generation algorithm to automatically produce rule-based, unbiased, and disentangled text descriptions via the kinematic characteristics for each motion.Extensive experiments show that our MotionBank is beneficial for general motion-related tasks of human motion generation, motion in-context generation, and motion understanding.Video motions together with the rule-based text annotations could serve as an efficient alternative for larger LMMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our dataset, codes, and benchmark will be publicly available at https://github.com/liangxuy/MotionBank. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.744</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent advances in customized video generation have enabled users to create videos tailored to both specific subjects and motion trajectories.However, existing methods often require complicated test-time fine-tuning and struggle with balancing subject learning and motion control, limiting their real-world applications.In this paper, we present DreamVideo-2, a zero-shot video customization framework capable of generating videos with a specific subject and motion trajectory, guided by a single image and a bounding box sequence, respectively, and without the need for test-time fine-tuning.Specifically, we introduce reference attention, which leverages the model's inherent capabilities for subject learning, and devise a mask-guided motion module to achieve precise motion control by fully utilizing the robust motion signal of box masks derived from bounding boxes.While these two components achieve their intended functions, we empirically observe that motion control tends to dominate over subject learning.To address this, we propose two key designs: 1) the masked reference attention, which integrates a blended latent mask modeling scheme into reference attention to enhance subject representations at the desired positions, and 2) a reweighted diffusion loss, which differentiates the contributions of regions inside and outside the bounding boxes to ensure a balance between subject and motion control.Extensive experimental results on a newly curated dataset demonstrate that DreamVideo-2 outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both subject customization and motion control.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset, code, and models will be made publicly available. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.856</span></span></p>

                  <p>Time Series Forecasting (TSF) is key functionality in numerous fields, including in finance, weather services, and energy management.While TSF methods are emerging these days, many of them require domain-specific data collection and model training and struggle with poor generalization performance on new domains.Foundation models aim to overcome this limitation.Pre-trained on large-scale language or time series data, they exhibit promising inferencing capabilities in new or unseen data.This has spurred a surge in new TSF foundation models.We propose a new benchmark, FoundTS, to enable thorough and fair evaluation and comparison of such models.FoundTS covers a variety of TSF foundation models, including those based on large language models and those pretrained on time series.Next, FoundTS supports different forecasting strategies, including zero-shot, few-shot, and full-shot, thereby facilitating more thorough evaluations.Finally, FoundTS offers a pipeline that standardizes evaluation processes such as dataset splitting, loading, normalization, and few-shot sampling, thereby facilitating fair evaluations.Building on this, we report on an extensive evaluation of TSF foundation models on a broad range of datasets from diverse domains and with different statistical characteristics.Specifically, we identify pros and cons and inherent limitations of existing foundation models, and we identify directions for future model design.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We make our code and datasets available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/FoundTS-C2B0. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.804</span></span></p>

                  <p>The conventional paradigm of using large language models (LLMs) for evaluating natural language generation (NLG) systems typically relies on two key inputs: (1) a clear definition of the NLG task to be evaluated and (2) a list of pre-defined evaluation criteria.This process treats LLMs as ''passive critics,'' strictly following human-defined criteria for evaluation.However, as new NLG tasks emerge, the criteria for assessing text quality can vary greatly.Consequently, these rigid evaluation methods struggle to adapt to diverse NLG tasks without extensive prompt engineering customized for each specific task.To address this limitation, we introduce Active-Critic, a novel LLM-based NLG evaluation protocol that enables LLMs to function as ''active critics.''Specifically, our protocol comprises two key stages.In the first stage, the LLM is instructed to infer the target NLG task and establish relevant evaluation criteria from the data.Building on this self-inferred information, the second stage dynamically optimizes the prompt to guide the LLM toward more human-aligned scoring decisions, while also generating detailed explanations to justify its evaluations.Experiments across four NLG evaluation tasks show that our approach achieves stronger alignment with human judgments than state-of-the-art evaluation methods.Our comprehensive analysis further highlights the effectiveness and explainability of Active-Critic with only a small amount of labeled data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We will share our code and data on GitHub. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.767</span></span></p>

                  <p>The denoising diffusion model has recently emerged as a powerful generative technique, capable of transforming noise into meaningful data.While theoretical convergence guarantees for diffusion models are well established when the target distribution aligns with the training distribution, practical scenarios often present mismatches.One common case is in zero-shot conditional diffusion sampling, where the target conditional distribution is different from the (unconditional) training distribution.These score-mismatched diffusion models remain largely unexplored from a theoretical perspective.In this paper, we present the first performance guarantee with explicit dimensional dependencies for general score-mismatched diffusion samplers, focusing on target distributions with finite second moments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We show that score mismatches result in an asymptotic distributional bias between the target and sampling distributions, proportional to the accumulated mismatch between the target and training distributions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span>This result can be directly applied to zero-shot conditional samplers for any conditional model, irrespective of measurement noise.Interestingly, the derived convergence upper bound offers useful guidance for designing a novel bias-optimal zero-shot sampler in linear conditional models that minimizes the asymptotic bias.For such bias-optimal samplers, we further establish convergence guarantees with explicit dependencies on dimension and conditioning, applied to several interesting target distributions, including those with bounded support and Gaussian mixtures.Our findings are supported by numerical studies.</p>

                  <p>Graphs are widely used for modeling relational data in real-world scenarios, such as social networks and urban computing.Existing LLM-based graph analysis approaches either integrate graph neural networks (GNNs) for specific machine learning tasks, limiting their transferability, or rely solely on LLMs' internal reasoning ability, resulting in suboptimal performance.To address these limitations, we take advantage of recent advances in LLM-based agents, which have shown capabilities of utilizing external knowledge or tools for problem solving.By simulating human problem-solving strategies such as analogy and collaboration, we propose a multi-agent system based on LLMs named GraphTeam, for graph analysis.GraphTeam consists of five LLM-based agents from three modules, and the agents with different specialities can collaborate with each other to address complex problems.Specifically, (1) input-output normalization module: the question agent extracts and refines four key arguments from the original question, facilitating the problem understanding, and the answer agent organizes the results to meet the output requirement; (2) external knowledge retrieval module: we first build a knowledge base consisting of relevant documentation and experience information, and then the search agent retrieves the most relevant entries for each question.(3) problem-solving module: given the retrieved information from search agent, the coding agent uses established algorithms via programming to generate solutions, and in case the coding agent does not work, the reasoning agent will directly compute the results without programming.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on six graph analysis benchmarks demonstrate that GraphTeam achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average 25.85% improvement over the best baseline in terms of accuracy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span>The code and data are available at https://github.com/BUPT-GAMMA/GraphTeam.</p>

                  <p>System call filtering is widely used to secure programs in multi-tenant environments, and to sandbox applications in modern desktop software deployment and package management systems.Filtering rules are hard to write and maintain manually, hence generating them automatically is essential.To that aim, analysis tools able to identify every system call that can legitimately be invoked by a program are needed.Existing static analysis works lack precision because of a high number of false positives, and/or assume the availability of program/libraries source code -- something unrealistic in many scenarios such as cloud production environments.   We present B-Side, a static binary analysis tool able to identify a superset of the system calls that an x86-64 static/dynamic executable may invoke at runtime.B-Side assumes no access to program/libraries sources, and shows a good degree of precision by leveraging symbolic execution, combined with a heuristic to detect system call wrappers, which represent an important source of precision loss in existing works.B-Side also allows to statically detect phases of execution in a program in which different filtering rules can be applied.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We validate B-Side and demonstrate its higher precision compared to state-of-the-art works: over a set of popular applications, B-Side's average $F_1$ score is 0.81, vs. 0.31 and 0.53 for competitors. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.722</span></span>Over 557 static and dynamically-compiled binaries taken from the Debian repositories, B-Side identifies an average of 43 system calls, vs. 271 and 95 for two state-of-the art competitors.We further evaluate the strictness of the phase-based filtering policies that can be obtained with B-Side.</p>

                  <p>Performative prediction (PP) is a framework that captures distribution shifts that occur during the training of machine learning models due to their deployment.As the trained model is used, its generated data could cause the model to evolve, leading to deviations from the original data distribution.The impact of such model-induced distribution shifts in the federated learning (FL) setup remains unexplored despite being increasingly likely to transpire in real-life use cases.Although Jin et al. (2024) recently extended PP to FL in a straightforward manner, the resulting model only converges to a performative stable point, which may be far from optimal.The methods in Izzo et al. (2021); Miller et al. (2021) can find a performative optimal point in centralized settings, but they require the performative risk to be convex and the training data to be noiseless, assumptions often violated in realistic FL systems.This paper overcomes all of these shortcomings and proposes Performative robust optimal Federated Learning (ProFL), an algorithm that finds performative optimal points in FL from noisy and contaminated data.We present the convergence analysis under the Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition, which applies to non-convex objectives.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on multiple datasets validate our proposed algorithms' efficiency. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.661</span></span></p>

                  <p>In this paper, we consider teams of robots with heterogeneous skills (e.g., sensing and manipulation) tasked with collaborative missions described by Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formulas.These LTL-encoded tasks require robots to apply their skills to specific regions and objects in a temporal and logical order.While existing temporal logic planning algorithms can synthesize correct-by-construction paths, they typically lack reactivity to unexpected failures of robot skills, which can compromise mission performance.This paper addresses this challenge by proposing a reactive LTL planning algorithm that adapts to unexpected failures during deployment.Specifically, the proposed algorithm reassigns sub-tasks to robots based on their functioning skills and locally revises team plans to accommodate these new assignments and ensure mission completion.The main novelty of the proposed algorithm is its ability to handle cases where mission completion becomes impossible due to limited functioning robots.Instead of reporting mission failure, the algorithm strategically prioritizes the most crucial sub-tasks and locally revises the team's plans, as per user-specified priorities, to minimize mission violations.We provide theoretical conditions under which the proposed framework computes the minimum violation task reassignments and team plans.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We provide numerical and hardware experiments to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.718</span></span></p>

                  <p>Dataset distillation has demonstrated strong performance on simple datasets like CIFAR, MNIST, and TinyImageNet but struggles to achieve similar results in more complex scenarios.In this paper, we propose EDF (emphasizes the discriminative features), a dataset distillation method that enhances key discriminative regions in synthetic images using Grad-CAM activation maps.Our approach is inspired by a key observation: in simple datasets, high-activation areas typically occupy most of the image, whereas in complex scenarios, the size of these areas is much smaller.Unlike previous methods that treat all pixels equally when synthesizing images, EDF uses Grad-CAM activation maps to enhance high-activation areas.From a supervision perspective, we downplay supervision signals that have lower losses, as they contain common patterns.Additionally, to help the DD community better explore complex scenarios, we build the Complex Dataset Distillation (Comp-DD) benchmark by meticulously selecting sixteen subsets, eight easy and eight hard, from ImageNet-1K. In particular, EDF consistently outperforms SOTA results in complex scenarios, such as ImageNet-1K subsets.Hopefully, more researchers will be inspired and encouraged to improve the practicality and efficacy of DD.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and benchmark will be made public at https://github.com/NUS-HPC-AI-Lab/EDF. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.64</span></span></p>

                  <p>Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) typically involves updating at least a few billions of parameters.A more parameter-efficient approach is Prompt Tuning (PT), which updates only a few learnable tokens, and differently, In-Context Learning (ICL) adapts the model to a new task by simply including examples in the input without any training.When applying optimization-based methods, such as fine-tuning and PT for few-shot learning, the model is specifically adapted to the small set of training examples, whereas ICL leaves the model unchanged.This distinction makes traditional learning methods more prone to overfitting; in contrast, ICL is less sensitive to the few-shot scenario.While ICL is not prone to overfitting, it does not fully extract the information that exists in the training examples.This work introduces Context-aware Prompt Tuning (CPT), a method inspired by ICL, PT, and adversarial attacks.We build on the ICL strategy of concatenating examples before the input, but we extend this by PT-like learning, refining the context embedding through iterative optimization to extract deeper insights from the training examples.We carefully modify specific context tokens, considering the unique structure of input and output formats.Inspired by adversarial attacks, we adjust the input based on the labels present in the context, focusing on minimizing, rather than maximizing, the loss.Moreover, we apply a projected gradient descent algorithm to keep token embeddings close to their original values, under the assumption that the user-provided data is inherently valuable.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our method has been shown to achieve superior accuracy across multiple classification tasks using various LLM models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.608</span></span></p>

                  <p>Stein variational inference (SVI) is a sample-based approximate Bayesian inference technique that generates a sample set by jointly optimizing the samples' locations to minimize an information-theoretic measure of discrepancy with the target probability distribution.SVI thus provides a fast and significantly more sample-efficient approach to Bayesian inference than traditional (random-sampling-based) alternatives.However, the optimization techniques employed in existing SVI methods struggle to address problems in which the target distribution is high-dimensional, poorly-conditioned, or non-convex, which severely limits the range of their practical applicability.In this paper, we propose a novel trust-region optimization approach for SVI that successfully addresses each of these challenges.Our method builds upon prior work in SVI by leveraging conditional independences in the target distribution (to achieve high-dimensional scaling) and second-order information (to address poor conditioning), while additionally providing an effective adaptive step control procedure, which is essential for ensuring convergence on challenging non-convex optimization problems.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results show our method achieves superior numerical performance, both in convergence rate and sample accuracy, and scales better in high-dimensional distributions, than previous SVI techniques. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.702</span></span></p>

                  <p>Efficient and accurate evaluation is crucial for the continuous improvement of large language models (LLMs).Among various assessment methods, subjective evaluation has garnered significant attention due to its superior alignment with real-world usage scenarios and human preferences.However, human-based evaluations are costly and lack reproducibility, making precise automated evaluators (judgers) vital in this process.In this report, we introduce \textbf{CompassJudger-1}, the first open-source \textbf{all-in-one} judge LLM.

                  <p>Despite the significant progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), their high computational cost remains a barrier to real-world deployment.Inspired by the mixture of depths (MoDs) in natural language processing, we aim to address this limitation from the perspective of ``activated tokens''.Our key insight is that if most tokens are redundant for the layer computation, then can be skipped directly via the MoD layer.However, directly converting the dense layers of MLLMs to MoD layers leads to substantial performance degradation.To address this issue, we propose an innovative MoD adaptation strategy for existing MLLMs called $\gamma$-MoD. In $\gamma$-MoD, a novel metric is proposed to guide the deployment of MoDs in the MLLM, namely rank of attention maps (ARank).Through ARank, we can effectively identify which layer is redundant and should be replaced with the MoD layer.Based on ARank, we further propose two novel designs to maximize the computational sparsity of MLLM while maintaining its performance, namely shared vision-language router and masked routing learning.With these designs, more than 90% dense layers of the MLLM can be effectively converted to the MoD ones.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To validate our method, we apply it to three popular MLLMs, and conduct extensive experiments on 9 benchmark datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.654</span></span>Experimental results not only validate the significant efficiency benefit of $\gamma$-MoD to existing MLLMs but also confirm its generalization ability on various MLLMs.For example, with a minor performance drop, i.e., -1.5%, $\gamma$-MoD can reduce the training and inference time of LLaVA-HR by 31.0% and 53.2%, respectively.</p>

                  <p>Many modern software applications present numerous ethical concerns due to conflicts between users' values and companies' priorities.Intersectional communities, those with multiple marginalized identities, are disproportionately affected by these ethical issues, leading to legal, financial, and reputational issues for software companies, as well as real-world harm for intersectional users.Historically, the voices of intersectional communities have been systematically marginalized and excluded from contributing their unique perspectives to software design, perpetuating software-related ethical concerns.   This work aims to fill the gap in research on intersectional users' software-related perspectives and provide software practitioners with a starting point to address their ethical concerns.We aggregated and analyzed the intersectional users' ethical concerns over time and developed a prioritization method to identify critical concerns.To achieve this, we collected posts from over 700 intersectional subreddits discussing software applications, utilized deep learning to identify ethical concerns in these posts, and employed state-of-the-art techniques to analyze their content in relation to time and priority.Our findings revealed that intersectional communities report \textit{critical} complaints related to cyberbullying, inappropriate content, and discrimination, highlighting significant flaws in modern software, particularly for intersectional users.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Based on these findings, we discuss how to better address the ethical concerns of intersectional users in software development. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span></p>
