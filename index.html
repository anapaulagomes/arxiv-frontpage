                  <p>Digital Pathology is a cornerstone in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases.A key task in this field is the identification and segmentation of cells in hematoxylin and eosin-stained images.Existing methods for cell segmentation often require extensive annotated datasets for training and are limited to a predefined cell classification scheme.To overcome these limitations, we propose $\text{CellViT}^{{\scriptscriptstyle ++}}$, a framework for generalized cell segmentation in digital pathology.$\text{CellViT}^{{\scriptscriptstyle ++}}$ utilizes Vision Transformers with foundation models as encoders to compute deep cell features and segmentation masks simultaneously.To adapt to unseen cell types, we rely on a computationally efficient approach.It requires minimal data for training and leads to a drastically reduced carbon footprint.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We demonstrate excellent performance on seven different datasets, covering a broad spectrum of cell types, organs, and clinical settings. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.846</span></span>The framework achieves remarkable zero-shot segmentation and data-efficient cell-type classification.Furthermore, we show that $\text{CellViT}^{{\scriptscriptstyle ++}}$ can leverage immunofluorescence stainings to generate training datasets without the need for pathologist annotations.The automated dataset generation approach surpasses the performance of networks trained on manually labeled data, demonstrating its effectiveness in creating high-quality training datasets without expert annotations.To advance digital pathology, $\text{CellViT}^{{\scriptscriptstyle ++}}$ is available as an open-source framework featuring a user-friendly, web-based interface for visualization and annotation.The code is available under https://github.com/TIO-IKIM/CellViT-plus-plus.</p>

                  <p>Recent advances in 2D image generation have achieved remarkable quality,largely driven by the capacity of diffusion models and the availability of large-scale datasets.However, direct 3D generation is still constrained by the scarcity and lower fidelity of 3D datasets.In this paper, we introduce Zero-1-to-G, a novel approach that addresses this problem by enabling direct single-view generation on Gaussian splats using pretrained 2D diffusion models.Our key insight is that Gaussian splats, a 3D representation, can be decomposed into multi-view images encoding different attributes.This reframes the challenging task of direct 3D generation within a 2D diffusion framework, allowing us to leverage the rich priors of pretrained 2D diffusion models.To incorporate 3D awareness, we introduce cross-view and cross-attribute attention layers, which capture complex correlations and enforce 3D consistency across generated splats.This makes Zero-1-to-G the first direct image-to-3D generative model to effectively utilize pretrained 2D diffusion priors, enabling efficient training and improved generalization to unseen objects.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on both synthetic and in-the-wild datasets demonstrate superior performance in 3D object generation, offering a new approach to high-quality 3D generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.727</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models, despite their significant capabilities, are known to fail in surprising and unpredictable ways.Evaluating their true `understanding' of language is particularly challenging due to the extensive web-scale data they are trained on.Therefore, we construct an evaluation to systematically assess natural language understanding (NLU) in LLMs by leveraging Construction Grammar (CxG), which provides insights into the meaning captured by linguistic elements known as constructions (Cxns).CxG is well-suited for this purpose because provides a theoretical basis to construct targeted evaluation sets.These datasets are carefully constructed to include examples which are unlikely to appear in pre-training data, yet intuitive and easy for humans to understand, enabling a more targeted and reliable assessment.Our experiments focus on downstream natural language inference and reasoning tasks by comparing LLMs' understanding of the underlying meanings communicated through 8 unique Cxns with that of humans.The results show that while LLMs demonstrate some knowledge of constructional information, even the latest models including GPT-o1 struggle with abstract meanings conveyed by these Cxns, as demonstrated in cases where test sentences are dissimilar to their pre-training data.We argue that such cases provide a more accurate test of true language understanding, highlighting key limitations in LLMs' semantic capabilities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We make our novel dataset and associated experimental data including prompts and model responses publicly available. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.72</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in various NLP tasks, including semantic parsing, which trans lates natural language into formal code representations.However, the reverse process, translating code into natural language, termed semantic captioning, has received less attention.This task is becoming increasingly important as LLMs are integrated into platforms for code generation, security analysis, and educational purposes.In this paper, we focus on the captioning of SQL query (SQL2Text) to address the critical need for understanding and explaining SQL queries in an era where LLM-generated code poses potential security risks.We repurpose Text2SQL datasets for SQL2Text by introducing an iterative ICL prompt using GPT-4o to generate multiple additional utterances, which enhances the robustness of the datasets for the reverse task.We conduct our experiments using in-context learning (ICL) based on different sample selection methods, emphasizing smaller, more computationally efficient LLMs.Our findings demonstrate that leveraging the inherent graph properties of SQL for ICL sample selection significantly outperforms random selection by up to 39% on BLEU score and provides better results than alternative methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Dataset and codes are published: \url{https://github.com/aliwister/ast-icl}. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.837</span></span></p>

                  <p>Human-scene interaction (HSI) generation is crucial for applications in embodied AI, virtual reality, and robotics.While existing methods can synthesize realistic human motions in 3D scenes and generate plausible human-object interactions, they heavily rely on datasets containing paired 3D scene and motion capture data, which are expensive and time-consuming to collect across diverse environments and interactions.We present ZeroHSI, a novel approach that enables zero-shot 4D human-scene interaction synthesis by integrating video generation and neural human rendering.Our key insight is to leverage the rich motion priors learned by state-of-the-art video generation models, which have been trained on vast amounts of natural human movements and interactions, and use differentiable rendering to reconstruct human-scene interactions.ZeroHSI can synthesize realistic human motions in both static scenes and environments with dynamic objects, without requiring any ground-truth motion data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate ZeroHSI on a curated dataset of different types of various indoor and outdoor scenes with different interaction prompts, demonstrating its ability to generate diverse and contextually appropriate human-scene interactions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.765</span></span></p>

                  <p>We present FaceLift, a feed-forward approach for rapid, high-quality, 360-degree head reconstruction from a single image.Our pipeline begins by employing a multi-view latent diffusion model that generates consistent side and back views of the head from a single facial input.These generated views then serve as input to a GS-LRM reconstructor, which produces a comprehensive 3D representation using Gaussian splats.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To train our system, we develop a dataset of multi-view renderings using synthetic 3D human head as-sets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.757</span></span>The diffusion-based multi-view generator is trained exclusively on synthetic head images, while the GS-LRM reconstructor undergoes initial training on Objaverse followed by fine-tuning on synthetic head data.FaceLift excels at preserving identity and maintaining view consistency across views.Despite being trained solely on synthetic data, FaceLift demonstrates remarkable generalization to real-world images.Through extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations, we show that FaceLift outperforms state-of-the-art methods in 3D head reconstruction, highlighting its practical applicability and robust performance on real-world images.In addition to single image reconstruction, FaceLift supports video inputs for 4D novel view synthesis and seamlessly integrates with 2D reanimation techniques to enable 3D facial animation.Project page: https://weijielyu.github.io/FaceLift.</p>

To address this gap, GIRAFE is a data repository designed to facilitate the development of advanced techniques for the semantic segmentation, analysis, and fast evaluation of High-Speed videoendoscopic sequences of the vocal folds.The repository includes 65 high-speed videoendoscopic recordings from a cohort of 50 patients (30 female, 20 male).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset comprises 15 recordings from healthy controls, 26 from patients with diagnosed voice disorders, and 24 with an unknown health condition. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.91</span></span>All of them were manually annotated by an expert, including the masks corresponding to the semantic segmentation of the glottal gap.The repository is also complemented with the automatic segmentation of the glottal area using different state-of-the-art approaches.

                  <p>We study the task of high-dimensional entangled mean estimation in the subset-of-signals model.Specifically, given $N$ independent random points $x_1,\ldots,x_N$ in $\mathbb{R}^D$ and a parameter $\alpha \in (0, 1)$ such that each $x_i$ is drawn from a Gaussian with mean $\mu$ and unknown covariance, and an unknown $\alpha$-fraction of the points have identity-bounded covariances, the goal is to estimate the common mean $\mu$. The one-dimensional version of this task has received significant attention in theoretical computer science and statistics over the past decades.Recent work [LY20; CV24] has given near-optimal upper and lower bounds for the one-dimensional setting.On the other hand, our understanding of even the information-theoretic aspects of the multivariate setting has remained limited.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we design a computationally efficient algorithm achieving an information-theoretically near-optimal error. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.6</span></span>Specifically, we show that the optimal error (up to polylogarithmic factors) is $f(\alpha,N) +\sqrt{D/(\alpha N)}$, where the term $f(\alpha,N)$ is the error of the one-dimensional problem and the second term is the sub-Gaussian error rate.Our algorithmic approach employs an iterative refinement strategy, whereby we progressively learn more accurate approximations $\hat \mu$ to $\mu$. This is achieved via a novel rejection sampling procedure that removes points significantly deviating from $\hat \mu$, as an attempt to filter out unusually noisy samples.A complication that arises is that rejection sampling introduces bias in the distribution of the remaining points.To address this issue, we perform a careful analysis of the bias, develop an iterative dimension-reduction strategy, and employ a novel subroutine inspired by list-decodable learning that leverages the one-dimensional result.</p>

                  <p>Over the last decade, representation learning, which embeds complex information extracted from large amounts of data into dense vector spaces, has emerged as a key technique in machine learning.Among other applications, it has been a key building block for large language models and advanced computer vision systems based on contrastive learning.A core component of representation learning systems is the projection head, which maps the original embeddings into different, often compressed spaces, while preserving the similarity relationship between vectors.   In this paper, we propose a quantum-inspired projection head that includes a corresponding quantum-inspired similarity metric.Specifically, we map classical embeddings onto quantum states in Hilbert space and introduce a quantum circuit-based projection head to reduce embedding dimensionality.To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, we extended the BERT language model by integrating our projection head for embedding compression.We compared the performance of embeddings, which were compressed using our quantum-inspired projection head, with those compressed using a classical projection head on information retrieval tasks using the TREC 2019 and TREC 2020Deep Learning benchmarks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results demonstrate that our quantum-inspired method achieves competitive performance relative to the classical method while utilizing 32 times fewer parameters. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.622</span></span>Furthermore, when trained from scratch, it notably excels, particularly on smaller datasets.This work not only highlights the effectiveness of the quantum-inspired approach but also emphasizes the utility of efficient, ad hoc low-entanglement circuit simulations within neural networks as a powerful quantum-inspired technique.</p>

                  <p>Grokking, the sudden generalization that occurs after prolonged overfitting, is a surprising phenomenon challenging our understanding of deep learning.Although significant progress has been made in understanding grokking, the reasons behind the delayed generalization and its dependence on regularization remain unclear.In this work, we argue that without regularization, grokking tasks push models to the edge of numerical stability, introducing floating point errors in the Softmax function, which we refer to as Softmax Collapse (SC).We demonstrate that SC prevents grokking and that mitigating SC enables grokking without regularization.Investigating the root cause of SC, we find that beyond the point of overfitting, the gradients strongly align with what we call the na\"ive loss minimization (NLM) direction.This component of the gradient does not alter the model's predictions but decreases the loss by scaling the logits, typically by scaling the weights along their current direction.We show that this scaling of the logits explains the delay in generalization characteristic of grokking and eventually leads to SC, halting further learning.To validate our hypotheses, we introduce two key contributions that address the challenges in grokking tasks: StableMax, a new activation function that prevents SC and enables grokking without regularization, and $\perp$Grad, a training algorithm that promotes quick generalization in grokking tasks by preventing NLM altogether.These contributions provide new insights into grokking, elucidating its delayed generalization, reliance on regularization, and the effectiveness of existing grokking-inducing methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code for this paper is available at https://github.com/LucasPrietoAl/grokking-at-the-edge-of-numerical-stability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.624</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent progress in controllable image generation and editing is largely driven by diffusion-based methods.Although diffusion models perform exceptionally well in specific tasks with tailored designs, establishing a unified model is still challenging.In contrast, autoregressive models inherently feature a unified tokenized representation, which simplifies the creation of a single foundational model for various tasks.In this work, we propose EditAR, a single unified autoregressive framework for a variety of conditional image generation tasks, e.g., image editing, depth-to-image, edge-to-image, segmentation-to-image.The model takes both images and instructions as inputs, and predicts the edited images tokens in a vanilla next-token paradigm.To enhance the text-to-image alignment, we further propose to distill the knowledge from foundation models into the autoregressive modeling process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate its effectiveness across diverse tasks on established benchmarks, showing competitive performance to various state-of-the-art task-specific methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.761</span></span>Project page: https://jitengmu.github.io/EditAR/</p>

                  <p>Distributed ledger technology offers several advantages for banking and finance industry, including efficient transaction processing and cross-party transaction reconciliation.The key challenges for adoption of this technology in financial institutes are (a) the building of a privacy-preserving ledger, (b) supporting auditing and regulatory requirements, and (c) flexibility to adapt to complex use-cases with multiple digital assets and actors.This paper proposes a framework for a private, audit-able, and distributed ledger (PADL) that adapts easily to fundamental use-cases within financial institutes.PADL employs widely-used cryptography schemes combined with zero-knowledge proofs to propose a transaction scheme for a `table' like ledger.It enables fast confidential peer-to-peer multi-asset transactions, and transaction graph anonymity, in a no-trust setup, but with customized privacy.We prove that integrity and anonymity of PADL is secured against a strong threat model.Furthermore, we showcase three fundamental real-life use-cases, namely, an assets exchange ledger, a settlement ledger, and a bond market ledger.Based on these use-cases we show that PADL supports smooth-lined inter-assets auditing while preserving privacy of the participants.For example, we show how a bank can be audited for its liquidity or credit risk without violation of privacy of itself or any other party, or how can PADL ensures honest coupon rate payment in bond market without sharing investors values.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, our evaluation shows PADL's advantage in performance against previous relevant schemes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.658</span></span></p>

                  <p>The contextual bandit problem, where agents arrive sequentially with personal contexts and the system adapts its arm allocation decisions accordingly, has recently garnered increasing attention for enabling more personalized outcomes.However, in many healthcare and recommendation applications, agents have private profiles and may misreport their contexts to gain from the system.For example, in adaptive clinical trials, where hospitals sequentially recruit volunteers to test multiple new treatments and adjust plans based on volunteers' reported profiles such as symptoms and interim data, participants may misreport severe side effects like allergy and nausea to avoid perceived suboptimal treatments.We are the first to study this issue of private context misreporting in a stochastic contextual bandit game between the system and non-repeated agents.We show that traditional low-regret algorithms, such as UCB family algorithms and Thompson sampling, fail to ensure truthful reporting and can result in linear regret in the worst case, while traditional truthful algorithms like explore-then-commit (ETC) and $\epsilon$-greedy algorithm incur sublinear but high regret.We propose a mechanism that uses a linear program to ensure truthfulness while minimizing deviation from Thompson sampling, yielding an $O(\ln T)$ frequentist regret.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our numerical experiments further demonstrate strong performance in multiple contexts and across other distribution families. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.632</span></span></p>

This paper provides an overview of the emerging SpecInt research area, characterizing the system architecture and the most relevant applications for cyber-physical security.We identify five subcategories of spectrum intelligence for cyber-physical security, encompassing Device Intelligence, Channel Intelligence, Location Intelligence, Communication Intelligence, and Ambient Intelligence.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also provide preliminary results based on an experimental testbed showing the viability, feasibility, and potential of this emerging application area. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.623</span></span>Finally, we point out current research challenges and future directions paving the way for further research in this domain.</p>

                  <p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) improves large language models (LLMs) by using external knowledge to guide response generation, reducing hallucinations.However, RAG, particularly multi-modal RAG, can introduce new hallucination sources: (i) the retrieval process may select irrelevant pieces (e.g., documents, images) as raw context from the database, and (ii) retrieved images are processed into text-based context via vision-language models (VLMs) or directly used by multi-modal language models (MLLMs) like GPT-4o, which may hallucinate.To address this, we propose a novel framework to evaluate the reliability of multi-modal RAG using two performance measures: (i) the relevancy score (RS), assessing the relevance of retrieved entries to the query, and (ii) the correctness score (CS), evaluating the accuracy of the generated response.We train RS and CS models using a ChatGPT-derived database and human evaluator samples.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Results show that both models achieve ~88% accuracy on test data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.657</span></span>Additionally, we construct a 5000-sample human-annotated database evaluating the relevancy of retrieved pieces and the correctness of response statements.Our RS model aligns with human preferences 20% more often than CLIP in retrieval, and our CS model matches human preferences ~91% of the time.Finally, we assess various RAG systems' selection and generation performances using RS and CS.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have sparked interest in their use for autonomous driving, particularly in generating interpretable driving decisions through natural language.However, the assumption that VLMs inherently provide visually grounded, reliable, and interpretable explanations for driving remains largely unexamined.To address this gap, we introduce DriveBench, a benchmark dataset designed to evaluate VLM reliability across 17 settings (clean, corrupted, and text-only inputs), encompassing 19,200 frames, 20,498 question-answer pairs, three question types, four mainstream driving tasks, and a total of 12 popular VLMs.Our findings reveal that VLMs often generate plausible responses derived from general knowledge or textual cues rather than true visual grounding, especially under degraded or missing visual inputs.This behavior, concealed by dataset imbalances and insufficient evaluation metrics, poses significant risks in safety-critical scenarios like autonomous driving.We further observe that VLMs struggle with multi-modal reasoning and display heightened sensitivity to input corruptions, leading to inconsistencies in performance.To address these challenges, we propose refined evaluation metrics that prioritize robust visual grounding and multi-modal understanding.Additionally, we highlight the potential of leveraging VLMs' awareness of corruptions to enhance their reliability, offering a roadmap for developing more trustworthy and interpretable decision-making systems in real-world autonomous driving contexts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The benchmark toolkit is publicly accessible. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.738</span></span></p>

This paper, therefore, introduces a new code graph-enhanced, structure-aware soft prompt tuning method for vulnerability detection, referred to as CGP-Tuning.It employs innovative type-aware embeddings to capture the rich semantic information within code graphs, along with a novel and efficient cross-modal alignment module that achieves linear computational cost while incorporating graph-text interactions.The proposed CGP-Tuning is evaluated on the latest DiverseVul dataset and the most recent open-source code LLMs, CodeLlama and CodeGemma.Experimental results demonstrate that CGP-Tuning outperforms the best state-of-the-art method by an average of 3.5 percentage points in accuracy, without compromising its vulnerability detection capabilities for long source code.</p>
