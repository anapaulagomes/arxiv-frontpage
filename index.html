First, to confirm the possibility that these models could indeed generate unsafe videos, we choose unsafe content generation prompts collected from 4chan and Lexica, and three open-source SOTA VGMs to generate unsafe videos.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>After filtering out duplicates and poorly generated content, we created an initial set of 2112 unsafe videos from an original pool of 5607 videos. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.829</span></span>Through clustering and thematic coding analysis of these generated videos, we identify 5 unsafe video categories: Distorted/Weird, Terrifying, Pornographic, Violent/Bloody, and Political.With IRB approval, we then recruit online participants to help label the generated videos.Based on the annotations submitted by 403 participants, we identified 937 unsafe videos from the initial video set.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>With the labeled information and the corresponding prompts, we created the first dataset of unsafe videos generated by VGMs.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.773</span></span>We then study possible defense mechanisms to prevent the generation of unsafe videos.Existing defense methods in image generation focus on filtering either input prompt or output results.We propose a new approach called Latent Variable Defense (LVD), which works within the model's internal sampling process.LVD can achieve 0.90 defense accuracy while reducing time and computing resources by 10x when sampling a large number of unsafe prompts.</p>

                  <p>Sign language is one of the most effective communication tools for people with hearing difficulties.Most existing works focus on improving the performance of sign language tasks on RGB videos, which may suffer from degraded recording conditions, such as fast movement of hands with motion blur and textured signer's appearance.The bio-inspired event camera, which asynchronously captures brightness change with high speed, could naturally perceive dynamic hand movements, providing rich manual clues for sign language tasks.In this work, we aim at exploring the potential of event camera in continuous sign language recognition (CSLR) and sign language translation (SLT).To promote the research, we first collect an event-based benchmark EvSign for those tasks with both gloss and spoken language annotations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>EvSign dataset offers a substantial amount of high-quality event streams and an extensive vocabulary of glosses and words, thereby facilitating the development of sign language tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.761</span></span>In addition, we propose an efficient transformer-based framework for event-based SLR and SLT tasks, which fully leverages the advantages of streaming events.The sparse backbone is employed to extract visual features from sparse events.Then, the temporal coherence is effectively utilized through the proposed local token fusion and gloss-aware temporal aggregation modules.Extensive experimental results are reported on both simulated (PHOENIX14T) and EvSign datasets.Our method performs favorably against existing state-of-the-art approaches with only 0.34% computational cost (0.84G FLOPS per video) and 44.2% network parameters.The project is available at https://zhang-pengyu.github.io/EVSign.</p>

                  <p>High-quality 3D photoacoustic imaging (PAI) reconstruction under sparse view or limited view has long been challenging.Traditional 3D iterative-based reconstruction methods suffer from both slow speed and high memory consumption.Recently, in computer graphics, the differentiable rendering has made significant progress, particularly with the rise of 3D Gaussian Splatting.Inspired by these, we introduce differentiable radiation into PAI, developing a novel reconstruction algorithm: the Sliding Ball Adaptive Growth algorithm (SlingBAG) for 3D PAI, which shows ability in high-quality 3D PAI reconstruction both under extremely sparse view and limited view.   We established the point cloud dataset in PAI, and used unique differentiable rapid radiator based on the spherical decomposition strategy and the randomly initialized point cloud adaptively optimized according to sparse sensor data.Each point undergoes updates in 3D coordinates, initial pressure, and resolution (denoted by the radius of ball).Points undergo adaptive growth during iterative process, including point destroying, splitting and duplicating along the gradient of their positions, manifesting the sliding ball effect.   Finally, our point cloud to voxel grid shader renders the final reconstruction results.Simulation and in vivo experiments demonstrate that our SlingBAG reconstruction result's SNR can be more than 40 dB under extremely sparse view, while the SNR of traditional back-projection algorithm's result is less than 20 dB. Moreover, the result of SlingBAG's structural similarity to the ground truth is significantly higher, with an SSIM value of 95.6%.   Notably, our differentiable rapid radiator can conduct forward PA simulation in homogeneous, non-viscous media substantially faster than current methods that numerically simulate the wave propagation, such as k-Wave.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset and all code will be open source. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.901</span></span></p>

                  <p>A key limitation of learned robot control policies is their inability to generalize outside their training data.Recent works on vision-language-action models (VLAs) have shown that the use of large, internet pre-trained vision-language models as the backbone of learned robot policies can substantially improve their robustness and generalization ability.Yet, one of the most exciting capabilities of large vision-language models in other domains is their ability to reason iteratively through complex problems.Can that same capability be brought into robotics to allow policies to improve performance by reasoning about a given task before acting?Naive use of "chain-of-thought" (CoT) style prompting is significantly less effective with standard VLAs because of the relatively simple training examples that are available to them.Additionally, purely semantic reasoning about sub-tasks, as is common in regular CoT, is insufficient for robot policies that need to ground their reasoning in sensory observations and the robot state.To this end, we introduce Embodied Chain-of-Thought Reasoning (ECoT) for VLAs, in which we train VLAs to perform multiple steps of reasoning about plans, sub-tasks, motions, and visually grounded features like object bounding boxes and end effector positions, before predicting the robot action.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We design a scalable pipeline for generating synthetic training data for ECoT on large robot datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.706</span></span>We demonstrate, that ECoT increases the absolute success rate of OpenVLA, the current strongest open-source VLA policy, by 28% across challenging generalization tasks, without any additional robot training data.Additionally, ECoT makes it easier for humans to interpret a policy's failures and correct its behavior using natural language.</p>

                  <p>Deep neural networks are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, a type of adversarial attack that poisons the training data to manipulate the behavior of models trained on such data.Clean-label attacks are a more stealthy form of backdoor attacks that can perform the attack without changing the labels of poisoned data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Early works on clean-label attacks added triggers to a random subset of the training set, ignoring the fact that samples contribute unequally to the attack's success. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.633</span></span>This results in high poisoning rates and low attack success rates.To alleviate the problem, several supervised learning-based sample selection strategies have been proposed.However, these methods assume access to the entire labeled training set and require training, which is expensive and may not always be practical.This work studies a new and more practical (but also more challenging) threat model where the attacker only provides data for the target class (e.g., in face recognition systems) and has no knowledge of the victim model or any other classes in the training set.We study different strategies for selectively poisoning a small set of training samples in the target class to boost the attack success rate in this setting.Our threat model poses a serious threat in training machine learning models with third-party datasets, since the attack can be performed effectively with limited information.Experiments on benchmark datasets illustrate the effectiveness of our strategies in improving clean-label backdoor attacks.</p>

                  <p>Semi-Supervised Visual Grounding (SSVG) is a new challenge for its sparse labeled data with the need for multimodel understanding.A previous study, RefTeacher, makes the first attempt to tackle this task by adopting the teacher-student framework to provide pseudo confidence supervision and attention-based supervision.However, this approach is incompatible with current state-of-the-art visual grounding models, which follow the Transformer-based pipeline.These pipelines directly regress results without region proposals or foreground binary classification, rendering them unsuitable for fitting in RefTeacher due to the absence of confidence scores.Furthermore, the geometric difference in teacher and student inputs, stemming from different data augmentations, induces natural misalignment in attention-based constraints.To establish a compatible SSVG framework, our paper proposes the ACTive REtraining approach for Semi-Supervised Visual Grounding, abbreviated as ACTRESS.Initially, the model is enhanced by incorporating an additional quantized detection head to expose its detection confidence.Building upon this, ACTRESS consists of an active sampling strategy and a selective retraining strategy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The active sampling strategy iteratively selects high-quality pseudo labels by evaluating three crucial aspects: Faithfulness, Robustness, and Confidence, optimizing the utilization of unlabeled data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span>The selective retraining strategy retrains the model with periodic re-initialization of specific parameters, facilitating the model's escape from local minima.Extensive experiments demonstrates our superior performance on widely-used benchmark datasets.</p>

                  <p>Domain adaptive semantic segmentation aims to generate accurate and dense predictions for an unlabeled target domain by leveraging a supervised model trained on a labeled source domain.The prevalent self-training approach involves retraining the dense discriminative classifier of $p(class|pixel feature)$ using the pseudo-labels from the target domain.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While many methods focus on mitigating the issue of noisy pseudo-labels, they often overlook the underlying data distribution p(pixel feature|class) in both the source and target domains. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.658</span></span>To address this limitation, we propose the multi-prototype Gaussian-Mixture-based (ProtoGMM) model, which incorporates the GMM into contrastive losses to perform guided contrastive learning.Contrastive losses are commonly executed in the literature using memory banks, which can lead to class biases due to underrepresented classes.Furthermore, memory banks often have fixed capacities, potentially restricting the model's ability to capture diverse representations of the target/source domains.An alternative approach is to use global class prototypes (i.e. averaged features per category).However, the global prototypes are based on the unimodal distribution assumption per class, disregarding within-class variation.To address these challenges, we propose the ProtoGMM model.This novel approach involves estimating the underlying multi-prototype source distribution by utilizing the GMM on the feature space of the source samples.The components of the GMM model act as representative prototypes.To achieve increased intra-class semantic similarity, decreased inter-class similarity, and domain alignment between the source and target domains, we employ multi-prototype contrastive learning between source distribution and target samples.The experiments show the effectiveness of our method on UDA benchmarks.</p>

                  <p>Person Re-identification (re-ID) in computer vision aims to recognize and track individuals across different cameras.While previous research has mainly focused on challenges like pose variations and lighting changes, the impact of extreme capture conditions is often not adequately addressed.These extreme conditions, including varied lighting, camera styles, angles, and image distortions, can significantly affect data distribution and re-ID accuracy.   Current research typically improves model generalization under normal shooting conditions through data augmentation techniques such as adjusting brightness and contrast.However, these methods pay less attention to the robustness of models under extreme shooting conditions.To tackle this, we propose a multi-mode synchronization learning (MMSL) strategy .This approach involves dividing images into grids, randomly selecting grid blocks, and applying data augmentation methods like contrast and brightness adjustments.This process introduces diverse transformations without altering the original image structure, helping the model adapt to extreme variations.This method improves the model's generalization under extreme conditions and enables learning diverse features, thus better addressing the challenges in re-ID.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on a simulated test set under extreme conditions have demonstrated the effectiveness of our method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.647</span></span>This approach is crucial for enhancing model robustness and adaptability in real-world scenarios, supporting the future development of person re-identification technology.</p>

                  <p>Deep convolutional neural networks have made significant breakthroughs in medical image classification, under the assumption that training samples from all classes are simultaneously available.However, in real-world medical scenarios, there's a common need to continuously learn about new diseases, leading to the emerging field of class incremental learning (CIL) in the medical domain.Typically, CIL suffers from catastrophic forgetting when trained on new classes.This phenomenon is mainly caused by the imbalance between old and new classes, and it becomes even more challenging with imbalanced medical datasets.In this work, we introduce two simple yet effective plug-in methods to mitigate the adverse effects of the imbalance.First, we propose a CIL-balanced classification loss to mitigate the classifier bias toward majority classes via logit adjustment.Second, we propose a distribution margin loss that not only alleviates the inter-class overlap in embedding space but also enforces the intra-class compactness.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate the effectiveness of our method with extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets (CCH5000, HAM10000, and EyePACS). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.733</span></span></p>

                  <p>In frame-based vision, object detection faces substantial performance degradation under challenging conditions due to the limited sensing capability of conventional cameras.Event cameras output sparse and asynchronous events, providing a potential solution to solve these problems.However, effectively fusing two heterogeneous modalities remains an open issue.In this work, we propose a novel hierarchical feature refinement network for event-frame fusion.The core concept is the design of the coarse-to-fine fusion module, denoted as the cross-modality adaptive feature refinement (CAFR) module.In the initial phase, the bidirectional cross-modality interaction (BCI) part facilitates information bridging from two distinct sources.Subsequently, the features are further refined by aligning the channel-level mean and variance in the two-fold adaptive feature refinement (TAFR) part.We conducted extensive experiments on two benchmarks: the low-resolution PKU-DDD17-Car dataset and the high-resolution DSEC dataset.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results show that our method surpasses the state-of-the-art by an impressive margin of $\textbf{8.0}\%$ on the DSEC dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.663</span></span>Besides, our method exhibits significantly better robustness (\textbf{69.5}\% versus \textbf{38.7}\%) when introducing 15 different corruption types to the frame images.The code can be found at the link (https://github.com/HuCaoFighting/FRN).</p>

                  <p>Object detection is a core task in computer vision.Over the years, the development of numerous models has significantly enhanced performance.However, these conventional models are usually limited by the data on which they were trained and by the category logic they define.With the recent rise of Language-Visual Models, new methods have emerged that are not restricted to these fixed categories.Despite their flexibility, such Open Vocabulary detection models still fall short in accuracy compared to traditional models with fixed classes.At the same time, more accurate data-specific models face challenges when there is a need to extend classes or merge different datasets for training.The latter often cannot be combined due to different logics or conflicting class definitions, making it difficult to improve a model without compromising its performance.In this paper, we introduce CerberusDet, a framework with a multi-headed model designed for handling multiple object detection tasks.Proposed model is built on the YOLO architecture and efficiently shares visual features from both backbone and neck components, while maintaining separate task heads.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This approach allows CerberusDet to perform very efficiently while still delivering optimal results. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.609</span></span>We evaluated the model on the PASCAL VOC dataset and additional categories from the Objects365 dataset to demonstrate its abilities.CerberusDet achieved results comparable to state-of-the-art data-specific models with 36% less inference time.The more tasks are trained together, the more efficient the proposed model becomes compared to running individual models sequentially.The training and inference code, as well as the model, are available as open-source (https://github.com/ai-forever/CerberusDet).</p>

                  <p>Montgomery modular multiplication is widely-used in public key cryptosystems (PKC) and affects the efficiency of upper systems directly.However, modulus is getting larger due to the increasing demand of security, which results in a heavy computing cost.High-performance implementation of Montgomery modular multiplication is urgently required to ensure the highly-efficient operations in PKC.However, existing high-speed implementations still need a large amount redundant computing to simplify the intermediate result.Supports to the redundant representation is extremely limited on Montgomery modular multiplication.In this paper, we propose an efficient parallel variant of iterative Montgomery modular multiplication, called DRMMM, that allows the quotient can be computed in multiple iterations.In this variant, terms in intermediate result and the quotient in each iteration are computed in different radix such that computation of the quotient can be pipelined.Based on proposed variant, we also design high-performance hardware implementation architecture for faster operation.In the architecture, intermediate result in every iteration is denoted as three parts to free from redundant computations.Finally, to support FPGA-based systems, we design operators based on FPGA underlying architecture for better area-time performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The result of implementation and experiment shows that our method reduces the output latency by 38.3\% than the fastest design on FPGA. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.63</span></span></p>

                  <p>Fine-tuning pre-trained language models (PLMs) has recently shown a potential to improve knowledge graph completion (KGC).However, most PLM-based methods encode only textual information, neglecting various topological structures of knowledge graphs (KGs).In this paper, we empirically validate the significant relations between the structural properties of KGs and the performance of the PLM-based methods.To leverage the structural knowledge, we propose a Subgraph-Aware Training framework for KGC (SATKGC) that combines (i) subgraph-aware mini-batching to encourage hard negative sampling, and (ii) a new contrastive learning method to focus more on harder entities and harder negative triples in terms of the structural properties.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to comprehensively incorporate the structural inductive bias of the subgraphs into fine-tuning PLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on four KGC benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of SATKGC. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>Our code is available.</p>

                  <p>Vision Transformers (ViT) have emerged as the de-facto choice for numerous industry grade vision solutions.But their inference cost can be prohibitive for many settings, as they compute self-attention in each layer which suffers from quadratic computational complexity in the number of tokens.On the other hand, spatial information in images and spatio-temporal information in videos is usually sparse and redundant.In this work, we introduce LookupViT, that aims to exploit this information sparsity to reduce ViT inference cost.LookupViT provides a novel general purpose vision transformer block that operates by compressing information from higher resolution tokens to a fixed number of tokens.These few compressed tokens undergo meticulous processing, while the higher-resolution tokens are passed through computationally cheaper layers.Information sharing between these two token sets is enabled through a bidirectional cross-attention mechanism.The approach offers multiple advantages - (a) easy to implement on standard ML accelerators (GPUs/TPUs) via standard high-level operators, (b) applicable to standard ViT and its variants, thus generalizes to various tasks, (c) can handle different tokenization and attention approaches.LookupViT also offers flexibility for the compressed tokens, enabling performance-computation trade-offs in a single trained model.We show LookupViT's effectiveness on multiple domains - (a) for image-classification (ImageNet-1K and ImageNet-21K), (b) video classification (Kinetics400 and Something-Something V2), (c) image captioning (COCO-Captions) with a frozen encoder.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>LookupViT provides $2\times$ reduction in FLOPs while upholding or improving accuracy across these domains. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span>In addition, LookupViT also demonstrates out-of-the-box robustness and generalization on image classification (ImageNet-C,R,A,O), improving by up to $4\%$ over ViT.</p>

                  <p>Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) aims to achieve pixel-level localization of sound sources in videos, while Audio-Visual Semantic Segmentation (AVSS), as an extension of AVS, further pursues semantic understanding of audio-visual scenes.However, since the AVSS task requires the establishment of audio-visual correspondence and semantic understanding simultaneously, we observe that previous methods have struggled to handle this mashup of objectives in end-to-end training, resulting in insufficient learning and sub-optimization.Therefore, we propose a two-stage training strategy called \textit{Stepping Stones}, which decomposes the AVSS task into two simple subtasks from localization to semantic understanding, which are fully optimized in each stage to achieve step-by-step global optimization.This training strategy has also proved its generalization and effectiveness on existing methods.To further improve the performance of AVS tasks, we propose a novel framework Adaptive Audio Visual Segmentation, in which we incorporate an adaptive audio query generator and integrate masked attention into the transformer decoder, facilitating the adaptive fusion of visual and audio features.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments demonstrate that our methods achieve state-of-the-art results on all three AVS benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.708</span></span>The project homepage can be accessed at https://gewu-lab.github.io/stepping_stones/.</p>

                  <p>While the use of machine learning for the detection of propaganda techniques in text has garnered considerable attention, most approaches focus on "black-box" solutions with opaque inner workings.Interpretable approaches provide a solution, however, they depend on careful feature engineering and costly expert annotated data.Additionally, language features specific to propagandistic text are generally the focus of rhetoricians or linguists, and there is no data set labeled with such features suitable for machine learning.This study codifies 22 rhetorical and linguistic features identified in literature related to the language of persuasion for the purpose of annotating an existing data set labeled with propaganda techniques.To help human experts annotate natural language sentences with these features, RhetAnn, a web application, was specifically designed to minimize an otherwise considerable mental effort.Finally, a small set of annotated data was used to fine-tune GPT-3.5, a generative large language model (LLM), to annotate the remaining data while optimizing for financial cost and classification accuracy.This study demonstrates how combining a small number of human annotated examples with GPT can be an effective strategy for scaling the annotation process at a fraction of the cost of traditional annotation relying solely on human experts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results are on par with the best performing model at the time of writing, namely GPT-4, at 10x less the cost. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.608</span></span>Our contribution is a set of features, their properties, definitions, and examples in a machine-readable format, along with the code for RhetAnn and the GPT prompts and fine-tuning procedures for advancing state-of-the-art interpretable propaganda technique detection.</p>

                  <p>Class-Incremental Semantic Segmentation(CISS) aims to learn new classes without forgetting the old ones, using only the labels of the new classes.To achieve this, two popular strategies are employed: 1) pseudo-labeling and knowledge distillation to preserve prior knowledge; and 2) background weight transfer, which leverages the broad coverage of background in learning new classes by transferring background weight to the new class classifier.However, the first strategy heavily relies on the old model in detecting old classes while undetected pixels are regarded as the background, thereby leading to the background shift towards the old classes(i.e., misclassification of old class as background).Additionally, in the case of the second approach, initializing the new class classifier with background knowledge triggers a similar background shift issue, but towards the new classes.To address these issues, we propose a background-class separation framework for CISS.To begin with, selective pseudo-labeling and adaptive feature distillation are to distill only trustworthy past knowledge.On the other hand, we encourage the separation between the background and new classes with a novel orthogonal objective along with label-guided output distillation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our state-of-the-art results validate the effectiveness of these proposed methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.748</span></span></p>

                  <p>Current multi-instance learning algorithms for pathology image analysis often require a substantial number of Whole Slide Images for effective training but exhibit suboptimal performance in scenarios with limited learning data.In clinical settings, restricted access to pathology slides is inevitable due to patient privacy concerns and the prevalence of rare or emerging diseases.The emergence of the Few-shot Weakly Supervised WSI Classification accommodates the significant challenge of the limited slide data and sparse slide-level labels for diagnosis.Prompt learning based on the pre-trained models (\eg, CLIP) appears to be a promising scheme for this setting; however, current research in this area is limited, and existing algorithms often focus solely on patch-level prompts or confine themselves to language prompts.This paper proposes a multi-instance prompt learning framework enhanced with pathology knowledge, \ie, integrating visual and textual prior knowledge into prompts at both patch and slide levels.The training process employs a combination of static and learnable prompts, effectively guiding the activation of pre-trained models and further facilitating the diagnosis of key pathology patterns.Lightweight Messenger (self-attention) and Summary (attention-pooling) layers are introduced to model relationships between patches and slides within the same patient data.Additionally, alignment-wise contrastive losses ensure the feature-level alignment between visual and textual learnable prompts for both patches and slides.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our method demonstrates superior performance in three challenging clinical tasks, significantly outperforming comparative few-shot methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.63</span></span></p>

                  <p>Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) is one of the most capable online search algorithms for sequential planning tasks, with significant applications in areas such as resource allocation and transit planning.Despite its strong performance in real-world deployment, the inherent complexity of MCTS makes it challenging to understand for users without technical background.This paper considers the use of MCTS in transportation routing services, where the algorithm is integrated to develop optimized route plans.These plans are required to meet a range of constraints and requirements simultaneously, further complicating the task of explaining the algorithm's operation in real-world contexts.To address this critical research gap, we introduce a novel computation tree logic-based explainer for MCTS.Our framework begins by taking user-defined requirements and translating them into rigorous logic specifications through the use of language templates.Then, our explainer incorporates a logic verification and quantitative evaluation module that validates the states and actions traversed by the MCTS algorithm.The outcomes of this analysis are then rendered into human-readable descriptive text using a second set of language templates.The user satisfaction of our approach was assessed through a survey with 82 participants.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results indicated that our explanatory approach significantly outperforms other baselines in user preference. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.636</span></span></p>

                  <p>We study the domain adaptation task for action recognition, namely domain adaptive action recognition, which aims to effectively transfer action recognition power from a label-sufficient source domain to a label-free target domain.Since actions are performed by humans, it is crucial to exploit human cues in videos when recognizing actions across domains.However, existing methods are prone to losing human cues but prefer to exploit the correlation between non-human contexts and associated actions for recognition, and the contexts of interest agnostic to actions would reduce recognition performance in the target domain.To overcome this problem, we focus on uncovering human-centric action cues for domain adaptive action recognition, and our conception is to investigate two aspects of human-centric action cues, namely human cues and human-context interaction cues.Accordingly, our proposed Human-Centric Transformer (HCTransformer) develops a decoupled human-centric learning paradigm to explicitly concentrate on human-centric action cues in domain-variant video feature learning.Our HCTransformer first conducts human-aware temporal modeling by a human encoder, aiming to avoid a loss of human cues during domain-invariant video feature learning.Then, by a Transformer-like architecture, HCTransformer exploits domain-invariant and action-correlated contexts by a context encoder, and further models domain-invariant interaction between humans and action-correlated contexts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct extensive experiments on three benchmarks, namely UCF-HMDB, Kinetics-NecDrone and EPIC-Kitchens-UDA, and the state-of-the-art performance demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed HCTransformer. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.633</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent advances in visual prompting in the natural image area have allowed users to interact with artificial intelligence (AI) tools through various visual marks such as box, point, and free-form shapes.However, due to the significant difference between the natural and remote sensing (RS) images, existing visual prompting models face challenges in RS scenarios.Moreover, RS MLLMs mainly focus on interpreting image-level RS data and only support interaction with language instruction, restricting flexibility applications in the real world.To address those limitations, a novel visual prompting model named EarthMarker is proposed, which excels in image-level, region-level, and point-level RS imagery interpretation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, the visual prompts alongside images and text instruction input into the large language model (LLM), adapt models toward specific predictions and tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span>Subsequently, a sharing visual encoding method is introduced to refine multi-scale image features and visual prompt information uniformly.Furthermore, to endow the EarthMarker with versatile multi-granularity visual perception abilities, the cross-domain phased learning strategy is developed, and the disjoint parameters are optimized in a lightweight manner by leveraging both the natural and RS domain-specific knowledge.In addition, to tackle the lack of RS visual prompting data, a dataset named RSVP featuring multi-modal fine-grained visual prompting instruction is constructed.Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the proposed EarthMarker's competitive performance, representing a significant advance in multi-granularity RS imagery interpretation under the visual prompting learning framework.</p>

                  <p>Cybersecurity issues in medical devices threaten patient safety and can cause harm if exploited.Standards and regulations therefore require vendors of such devices to provide an assessment of the cybersecurity risks as well as a description of their mitigation.Security assurance cases (SACs) capture these elements as a structured argument.Compiling an SAC requires taking domain-specific regulations and requirements as well as the way of working into account.In this case study, we evaluate CASCADE, an approach for building SAC in the context of a large medical device manufacturer with an established agile development workflow.We investigate the regulatory context as well as the adaptations needed in the development process.Our results show the suitability of SACs in the medical device industry.We identified 17 use cases in which an SAC supports internal and external needs.The connection to safety assurance can be achieved by incorporating information from the risk assessment matrix into the SAC.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Integration into the development process can be achieved by introducing a new role and rules for the design review and the release to production as well as additional criteria for the definition of done. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.636</span></span>We also show that SACs built with CASCADE fulfill the requirements of relevant standards in the medical domain such as ISO 14971.</p>
