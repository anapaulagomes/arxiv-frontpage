                  <p>Spatial understanding is a crucial capability for robots to make grounded decisions based on their environment.This foundational skill enables robots not only to perceive their surroundings but also to reason about and interact meaningfully within the world.In modern robotics, these capabilities are taken on by visual language models, and they face significant challenges when applied to spatial reasoning context due to their training data sources.These sources utilize general-purpose image datasets, and they often lack sophisticated spatial scene understanding capabilities.For example, the datasets do not address reference frame comprehension - spatial relationships require clear contextual understanding, whether from an ego-centric, object-centric, or world-centric perspective, which allow for effective real-world interaction.To address this issue, we introduce RoboSpatial, a large-scale spatial understanding dataset consisting of real indoor and tabletop scenes captured as 3D scans and egocentric images, annotated with rich spatial information relevant to robotics.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset includes 1M images, 5K 3D scans, and 3M annotated spatial relationships, with paired 2D egocentric images and 3D scans to make it both 2D and 3D ready. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.938</span></span>Our experiments show that models trained with RoboSpatial outperform baselines on downstream tasks such as spatial affordance prediction, spatial relationship prediction, and robotics manipulation.</p>

                  <p>AI-driven video generation techniques have made significant progress in recent years.However, AI-generated videos (AGVs) involving human activities often exhibit substantial visual and semantic distortions, hindering the practical application of video generation technologies in real-world scenarios.To address this challenge, we conduct a pioneering study on human activity AGV quality assessment, focusing on visual quality evaluation and the identification of semantic distortions.First, we construct the AI-Generated Human activity Video Quality Assessment (Human-AGVQA) dataset, consisting of 3,200 AGVs derived from 8 popular text-to-video (T2V) models using 400 text prompts that describe diverse human activities.We conduct a subjective study to evaluate the human appearance quality, action continuity quality, and overall video quality of AGVs, and identify semantic issues of human body parts.Based on Human-AGVQA, we benchmark the performance of T2V models and analyze their strengths and weaknesses in generating different categories of human activities.Second, we develop an objective evaluation metric, named AI-Generated Human activity Video Quality metric (GHVQ), to automatically analyze the quality of human activity AGVs.GHVQ systematically extracts human-focused quality features, AI-generated content-aware quality features, and temporal continuity features, making it a comprehensive and explainable quality metric for human activity AGVs.The extensive experimental results show that GHVQ outperforms existing quality metrics on the Human-AGVQA dataset by a large margin, demonstrating its efficacy in assessing the quality of human activity AGVs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The Human-AGVQA dataset and GHVQ metric will be released in public at https://github.com/zczhang-sjtu/GHVQ.git <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.733</span></span></p>

                  <p>Circular-arc graphs are the intersection graphs of arcs of a circle.The main result of this work describes the structure of all \emph{normalized intersection models} of circular-arc graphs.Normalized models of a circular-arc graph reflect the neighborhood relation between its vertices and can be seen as its canonical representations; in particular, any intersection model can be made normalized by possibly extending some of its arcs.We~devise a data-structure, called \emph{PQM-tree}, that maintains the set of all normalized models of a circular-arc graph.We show that the PQM-tree of a circular-arc graph can be computed in linear time.Finally, basing on PQM-trees, we provide a linear-time algorithm for the canonization and the isomorphism problem for circular-arc graphs.   We describe the structure of the normalized models of circular-arc graphs using an approach proposed by Hsu~[\emph{SIAM J. Comput.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>24(3), 411--439, (1995)}]. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.712</span></span>In the aforementioned work, Hsu claimed the construction of decomposition trees representing the set of all normalized intersection models of circular-arc graphs and an $\mathcal{O}(nm)$ time isomorphism algorithm for this class of graphs.However, the counterexample given in~[\emph{Discrete Math.Theor.Comput.Sci., 15(1), 157--182, 2013}] shows that Hsu's isomorphism algorithm is not incorrect.Also, in a companion paper we show that the decomposition trees proposed by Hsu are not constructed correctly; in particular, we showed that there are circular-arc graphs whose all normalized models do not follow the description given by Hsu.</p>

                  <p>Individuals who identify as sexual and gender minorities, including lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and others (LGBTQ+) are more likely to experience poorer health than their heterosexual and cisgender counterparts.One primary source that drives these health disparities is minority stress (i.e., chronic and social stressors unique to LGBTQ+ communities' experiences adapting to the dominant culture).This stress is frequently expressed in LGBTQ+ users' posts on social media platforms.However, these expressions are not just straightforward manifestations of minority stress.They involve linguistic complexity (e.g., idiom or lexical diversity), rendering them challenging for many traditional natural language processing methods to detect.In this work, we designed a hybrid model using Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), a pre-trained deep language model to improve the classification performance of minority stress detection.We experimented with our model on a benchmark social media dataset for minority stress detection (LGBTQ+ MiSSoM+).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset is comprised of 5,789 human-annotated Reddit posts from LGBTQ+ subreddits. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.878</span></span>Our approach enables the extraction of hidden linguistic nuances through pretraining on a vast amount of raw data, while also engaging in transductive learning to jointly develop representations for both labeled training data and unlabeled test data.The RoBERTa-GCN model achieved an accuracy of 0.86 and an F1 score of 0.86, surpassing the performance of other baseline models in predicting LGBTQ+ minority stress.Improved prediction of minority stress expressions on social media could lead to digital health interventions to improve the wellbeing of LGBTQ+ people-a community with high rates of stress-sensitive health problems.</p>

                  <p>Detecting disasters in underground mining, such as explosions and structural damage, has been a persistent challenge over the years.This problem is compounded for first responders, who often have no clear information about the extent or nature of the damage within the mine.The poor-light or even total darkness inside the mines makes rescue efforts incredibly difficult, leading to a tragic loss of life.In this paper, we propose a novel instance segmentation method called DIS-Mine, specifically designed to identify disaster-affected areas within underground mines under low-light or poor visibility conditions, aiding first responders in rescue efforts.DIS-Mine is capable of detecting objects in images, even in complete darkness, by addressing challenges such as high noise, color distortions, and reduced contrast.The key innovations of DIS-Mine are built upon four core components: i) Image brightness improvement, ii) Instance segmentation with SAM integration, iii) Mask R-CNN-based segmentation, and iv) Mask alignment with feature matching.On top of that, we have collected real-world images from an experimental underground mine, introducing a new dataset named ImageMine, specifically gathered in low-visibility conditions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This dataset serves to validate the performance of DIS-Mine in realistic, challenging environments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.769</span></span>Our comprehensive experiments on the ImageMine dataset, as well as on various other datasets demonstrate that DIS-Mine achieves a superior F1 score of 86.0% and mIoU of 72.0%, outperforming state-of-the-art instance segmentation methods, with at least 15x improvement and up to 80% higher precision in object detection.</p>

                  <p>Accurate and fast recognition of forgeries is an issue of great importance in the fields of artificial intelligence, image processing and object detection.Recognition of forgeries of facial imagery is the process of classifying and defining the faces in it by analyzing real-world facial images.This process is usually accomplished by extracting features from an image, using classifier algorithms, and correctly interpreting the results.Recognizing forgeries of facial imagery correctly can encounter many different challenges.For example, factors such as changing lighting conditions, viewing faces from different angles can affect recognition performance, and background complexity and perspective changes in facial images can make accurate recognition difficult.Despite these difficulties, significant progress has been made in the field of forgery detection.Deep learning algorithms, especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have significantly improved forgery detection performance.   This study focuses on image processing-based forgery detection using Fake-Vs-Real-Faces (Hard)[10] and 140k Real and Fake Faces<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>[61] data sets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.928</span></span>Both data sets consist of two classes containing real and fake facial images.In our study, two lightweight deep learning models are proposed to conduct forgery detection using these images.Additionally, 8 different pretrained CNN architectures were tested on both data sets and the results were compared with newly developed lightweight CNN models.It's shown that the proposed lightweight deep learning models have minimum number of layers.It's also shown that the proposed lightweight deep learning models detect forgeries of facial imagery accurately, and computationally efficiently.Although the data set consists only of face images, the developed models can also be used in other two-class object recognition problems.</p>

                  <p>Text-to-image diffusion model is a popular paradigm that synthesizes personalized images by providing a text prompt and a random Gaussian noise.While people observe that some noises are ``golden noises'' that can achieve better text-image alignment and higher human preference than others, we still lack a machine learning framework to obtain those golden noises.To learn golden noises for diffusion sampling, we mainly make three contributions in this paper.First, we identify a new concept termed the \textit{noise prompt}, which aims at turning a random Gaussian noise into a golden noise by adding a small desirable perturbation derived from the text prompt.Following the concept, we first formulate the \textit{noise prompt learning} framework that systematically learns ``prompted'' golden noise associated with a text prompt for diffusion models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Second, we design a noise prompt data collection pipeline and collect a large-scale \textit{noise prompt dataset}~(NPD) that contains 100k pairs of random noises and golden noises with the associated text prompts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.838</span></span>With the prepared NPD as the training dataset, we trained a small \textit{noise prompt network}~(NPNet) that can directly learn to transform a random noise into a golden noise.The learned golden noise perturbation can be considered as a kind of prompt for noise, as it is rich in semantic information and tailored to the given text prompt.Third, our extensive experiments demonstrate the impressive effectiveness and generalization of NPNet on improving the quality of synthesized images across various diffusion models, including SDXL, DreamShaper-xl-v2-turbo, and Hunyuan-DiT.Moreover, NPNet is a small and efficient controller that acts as a plug-and-play module with very limited additional inference and computational costs, as it just provides a golden noise instead of a random noise without accessing the original pipeline.</p>

                  <p>Consider the following stochastic matching problem.Given a graph $G=(V, E)$, an unknown subgraph $G_p = (V, E_p)$ is realized where $E_p$ includes every edge of $E$ independently with some probability $p \in (0, 1]$. The goal is to query a sparse subgraph $H$ of $G$, such that the realized edges in $H$ include an approximate maximum matching of $G_p$.   This problem has been studied extensively over the last decade due to its numerous applications in kidney exchange, online dating, and online labor markets.For any fixed $\epsilon > 0$, [BDH STOC'20] showed that any graph $G$ has a subgraph $H$ with $\text{quasipoly}(1/p) = (1/p)^{\text{poly}(\log(1/p))}$ maximum degree, achieving a $(1-\epsilon)$-approximation.A major open question is the best approximation achievable with $\text{poly}(1/p)$-degree subgraphs.A long line of work has progressively improved the approximation in the $\text{poly}(1/p)$-degree regime from .5[BDH+ EC'15] to .501[AKL EC'17], .656<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>[BHFR SODA'19], .666 <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.78</span></span>[AB SOSA'19], .731[BBD SODA'22] (bipartite graphs), and most recently to .68[DS '24].In this work, we show that a $\text{poly}(1/p)$-degree subgraph can obtain a $(1-\epsilon)$-approximation for any desirably small fixed $\epsilon > 0$, achieving the best of both worlds.   Beyond its quantitative improvement, a key conceptual contribution of our work is to connect local computation algorithms (LCAs) to the stochastic matching problem for the first time.While prior work on LCAs mainly focuses on their out-queries (the number of vertices probed to produce the output of a given vertex), our analysis also bounds the in-queries (the number of vertices that probe a given vertex).We prove that the outputs of LCAs with bounded in- and out-queries (in-n-out LCAs for short) have limited correlation, a property that our analysis crucially relies on and might find applications beyond stochastic matchings.</p>

                  <p>When unsure about an answer, humans often respond with more words than necessary, hoping that part of the response will be correct.We observe a similar behavior in large language models (LLMs), which we term "Verbosity Compensation" (VC).VC is harmful because it confuses the user understanding, leading to low efficiency, and influences the LLM services by increasing the latency and cost of generating useless tokens.In this paper, we present the first work that defines and analyzes Verbosity Compensation, explores its causes, and proposes a simple mitigating approach.We define Verbosity Compensation as the behavior of generating responses that can be compressed without information loss when prompted to write concisely.Our experiments, conducted on five datasets of knowledge and reasoning-based QA tasks with 14 newly developed LLMs, reveal three conclusions.1) We reveal a pervasive presence of verbosity compensation across all models and all datasets.Notably, GPT-4 exhibits a VC frequency of 50.40%.2)We reveal the large performance gap between verbose and concise responses, with a notable difference of 27.61% on the Qasper dataset.We also demonstrate that this difference does not naturally diminish as LLM capability increases.Both 1) and 2) highlight the urgent need to mitigate the frequency of VC behavior and disentangle verbosity with veracity.We propose a simple yet effective cascade algorithm that replaces the verbose responses with the other model-generated responses.The results show that our approach effectively alleviates the VC of the Mistral model from 63.81% to 16.16% on the Qasper dataset.3) We also find that verbose responses exhibit higher uncertainty across all five datasets, suggesting a strong connection between verbosity and model uncertainty.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our dataset and code are available at https://github.com/psunlpgroup/VerbosityLLM. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.837</span></span></p>

                  <p>With the recent exhibited strength of generative diffusion models, an open research question is \textit{if images generated by these models can be used to learn better visual representations}.While this generative data expansion may suffice for easier visual tasks, we explore its efficacy on a more difficult discriminative task: clothes-changing person re-identification (CC-ReID).CC-ReID aims to match people appearing in non-overlapping cameras, even when they change their clothes across cameras.Not only are current CC-ReID models constrained by the limited diversity of clothing in current CC-ReID datasets, but generating additional data that retains important personal features for accurate identification is a current challenge.To address this issue we propose DLCR, a novel data expansion framework that leverages pre-trained diffusion and large language models (LLMs) to accurately generate diverse images of individuals in varied attire.We generate additional data for five benchmark CC-ReID datasets (PRCC, CCVID, LaST, VC-Clothes, and LTCC) and \textbf{increase their clothing diversity by \boldmath{$10$}x, totaling over \boldmath{$2.1$}M images generated}.DLCR employs diffusion-based text-guided inpainting, conditioned on clothing prompts constructed using LLMs, to generate synthetic data that only modifies a subject's clothes while preserving their personally identifiable features.With this massive increase in data, we introduce two novel strategies - progressive learning and test-time prediction refinement - that respectively reduce training time and further boosts CC-ReID performance.On the PRCC dataset, we obtain a large top-1 accuracy improvement of $11.3\%$ by training CAL, a previous state of the art (SOTA) method, with DLCR-generated data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We publicly release our code and generated data for each dataset here: \url{https://github.com/CroitoruAlin/dlcr}. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.907</span></span></p>

                  <p>Moral sentiments expressed in natural language significantly influence both online and offline environments, shaping behavioral styles and interaction patterns, including social media selfpresentation, cyberbullying, adherence to social norms, and ethical decision-making.To effectively measure moral sentiments in natural language processing texts, it is crucial to utilize large, annotated datasets that provide nuanced understanding for accurate analysis and modeltraining.However, existing corpora, while valuable, often face linguistic limitations.To address this gap in the Chinese language domain,we introduce the Moral Foundation Weibo Corpus.This corpus consists of 25,671 Chinese comments on Weibo, encompassing six diverse topic areas.Each comment is manually annotated by at least three systematically trained annotators based on ten moral categories derived from a grounded theory of morality.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To assess annotator reliability, we present the kappa testresults, a gold standard for measuring consistency. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.635</span></span>Additionally, we apply several the latest large language models to supplement the manual annotations, conducting analytical experiments to compare their performance and report baseline results for moral sentiment classification.</p>

                  <p>In real-world NLP applications, Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising solutions due to their extensive training on vast datasets.However, the large size and high computation demands of LLMs limit their practicality in many applications, especially when further fine-tuning is required.To address these limitations, smaller models are typically preferred for deployment.However, their training is hindered by the scarcity of labeled data.In contrast, unlabeled data is often readily which can be leveraged by using LLMs to generate pseudo-labels for training smaller models.This enables the smaller models (student) to acquire knowledge from LLMs(teacher) while reducing computational costs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This process introduces challenges, such as potential noisy pseudo-labels. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.612</span></span>Selecting high-quality and informative data is therefore critical to enhance model performance while improving the efficiency of data utilization.To address this, we propose LLKD that enables Learning with Less computational resources and less data for Knowledge Distillation from LLMs.LLKD is an adaptive sample selection method that incorporates signals from both the teacher and student.Specifically, it prioritizes samples where the teacher demonstrates high confidence in its labeling, indicating reliable labels, and where the student exhibits a high information need, identifying challenging samples that require further learning.Our comprehensive experiments show that LLKD achieves superior performance across various datasets with higher data efficiency.</p>

                  <p>Characterizing the computational power of neural network architectures in terms of formal language theory remains a crucial line of research, as it describes lower and upper bounds on the reasoning capabilities of modern AI.However, when empirically testing these bounds, existing work often leaves a discrepancy between experiments and the formal claims they are meant to support.The problem is that formal language theory pertains specifically to recognizers: machines that receive a string as input and classify whether it belongs to a language.On the other hand, it is common to instead use proxy tasks that are similar in only an informal sense, such as language modeling or sequence-to-sequence transduction.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We correct this mismatch by training and evaluating neural networks directly as binary classifiers of strings, using a general method that can be applied to a wide variety of languages. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span>As part of this, we extend an algorithm recently proposed by Sn{\ae}bjarnarson et al.

                  <p>In this paper, we introduce DINO-X, which is a unified object-centric vision model developed by IDEA Research with the best open-world object detection performance to date.DINO-X employs the same Transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture as Grounding DINO 1.5 to pursue an object-level representation for open-world object understanding.To make long-tailed object detection easy, DINO-X extends its input options to support text prompt, visual prompt, and customized prompt.With such flexible prompt options, we develop a universal object prompt to support prompt-free open-world detection, making it possible to detect anything in an image without requiring users to provide any prompt.To enhance the model's core grounding capability, we have constructed a large-scale dataset with over 100 million high-quality grounding samples, referred to as Grounding-100M, for advancing the model's open-vocabulary detection performance.Pre-training on such a large-scale grounding dataset leads to a foundational object-level representation, which enables DINO-X to integrate multiple perception heads to simultaneously support multiple object perception and understanding tasks, including detection, segmentation, pose estimation, object captioning, object-based QA, etc.Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of DINO-X. Specifically, the DINO-X Pro model achieves 56.0 AP, 59.8 AP, and 52.4 AP on the COCO, LVIS-minival, and LVIS-val zero-shot object detection benchmarks, respectively.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Notably, it scores 63.3 AP and 56.5 AP on the rare classes of LVIS-minival and LVIS-val benchmarks, both improving the previous SOTA performance by 5.8 AP. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.626</span></span>Such a result underscores its significantly improved capacity for recognizing long-tailed objects.</p>

                  <p>We prove direct-sum theorems for Wilber's two lower bounds[Wilber, FOCS'86] on the cost of access sequences in the binary search tree (BST) model.These bounds are central to the question of dynamic optimality [Sleator and Tarjan, JACM'85]: the Alternation bound is the only bound to have yielded online BST algorithms beating $\log n$ competitive ratio, while the Funnel bound has repeatedly been conjectured to exactly characterize the cost of executing an access sequence using the optimal tree[Wilber, FOCS'86, Kozma'16], and has been explicitly linked to splay trees[Levy and Tarjan, SODA'19].Previously, the direct-sum theorem for the Alternation bound was known only when approximation was allowed [Chalermsook, Chuzhoy and Saranurak, APPROX'20, ToC'24].   We use these direct-sum theorems to amplify the sequences from [Lecomte and Weinstein, ESA'20] that separate between Wilber's Alternation and Funnel bounds, increasing the Alternation and Funnel bounds while optimally maintaining the separation.As a corollary, we show that Tango trees<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>[Demaine et al., FOCS'04] are optimal among any BST algorithms that charge their costs to the Alternation bound. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.619</span></span>This is true for any value of the Alternation bound, even values for which Tango trees achieve a competitive ratio of $o(\log \log n)$ instead of the default $O(\log \log n)$.

                  <p>Research on Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches for discrete optimization problems has increased considerably, extending RL to an area classically dominated by Operations Research (OR).Vehicle routing problems are a good example of discrete optimization problems with high practical relevance where RL techniques have had considerable success.Despite these advances, open-source development frameworks remain scarce, hampering both the testing of algorithms and the ability to objectively compare results.This ultimately slows down progress in the field and limits the exchange of ideas between the RL and OR communities.   Here we propose a library composed of multi-agent environments that simulates classic vehicle routing problems.The library, built on PyTorch, provides a flexible modular architecture design that allows easy customization and incorporation of new routing problems.It follows the Agent Environment Cycle ("AEC") games model and has an intuitive API, enabling rapid adoption and easy integration into existing reinforcement learning frameworks.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The library allows for a straightforward use of classical OR benchmark instances in order to narrow the gap between the test beds for algorithm benchmarking used by the RL and OR communities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.689</span></span>Additionally, we provide benchmark instance sets for each environment, as well as baseline RL models and training code.</p>

                  <p>Linearity testing has been a focal problem in property testing of functions.We combine different known techniques and observations about linearity testing in order to resolve two recent versions of this task.   First, we focus on the online manipulations model introduced by Kalemaj, Raskhodnikova and Varma (ITCS 2022 \& Theory of Computing 2023).In this model, up to $t$ data entries are adversarially manipulated after each query is answered.Ben-Eliezer, Kelman, Meir, and Raskhodnikova (ITCS 2024) showed an asymptotically optimal linearity tester that is resilient to $t$ manipulations per query, but their approach fails if $t$ is too large.We extend this result, showing an optimal tester for almost any possible value of $t$. First, we simplify their result when $t$ is small, and for larger values of $t$ we instead use sample-based testers, as defined by Goldreich and Ron (ACM Transactions on Computation Theory 2016).A key observation is that sample-based testing is resilient to online manipulations, but still achieves optimal query complexity for linearity when $t$ is large.We complement our result by showing that when $t$ is \emph{very} large, any reasonable property, and in particular linearity, cannot be tested at all.   Second, we consider linearity over the reals with proximity parameter $\varepsilon$. Fleming and Yoshida (ITCS 2020) gave a tester using $O(1/\varepsilon\ \cdot log(1/\varepsilon))$ queries.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We simplify their algorithms and modify the analysis accordingly, showing an optimal tester that only uses $O(1/\varepsilon)$ queries. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.634</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This modification works for the low-degree testers presented in Arora, Bhattacharyya, Fleming, Kelman, and Yoshida (SODA 2023) as well, resulting in optimal testers for degree-$d$ polynomials, for any constant degree $d$. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.655</span></span></p>

                  <p>Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT)-inspired tactile sensors are gaining attention in robotic tactile sensing due to their cost-effectiveness, safety, and scalability with sparse electrode configurations.This paper presents a data augmentation strategy for learning-based tactile reconstruction that amplifies the original single-frame signal measurement into 32 distinct, effective signal data for training.This approach supplements uncollected conditions of position information, resulting in more accurate and high-resolution tactile reconstructions.Data augmentation for EIT significantly reduces the required EIT measurements and achieves promising performance with even limited samples.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Simulation results show that the proposed method improves the correlation coefficient by over 12% and reduces the relative error by over 21% under various noise levels. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.665</span></span>Furthermore, we demonstrate that a standard deep neural network (DNN) utilizing the proposed data augmentation reduces the required data down to 1/31 while achieving a similar tactile reconstruction quality.Real-world tests further validate the approach's effectiveness on a flexible EIT-based tactile sensor.These results could help address the challenge of training tactile sensing networks with limited available measurements, improving the accuracy and applicability of EIT-based tactile sensing systems.</p>

                  <p>Many software engineering maintenance tasks require linking a commit that induced a bug with the commit that later fixed that bug.Several existing SZZ algorithms provide a way to identify the potential commit that induced a bug when given a fixing commit as input.Prior work introduced the notion of a "work item", a logical grouping of commits that could be a single unit of work.Our key insight in this work is to recognize that a bug-inducing commit and the fix(es) for that bug together represent a "work item."It is not currently understood how these work items, which are logical groups of revisions addressing a single issue or feature, could impact the performance of algorithms such as SZZ.In this paper, we propose a heuristic that, given an input commit, uses information about changed methods to identify related commits that form a work item with the input commit.We hypothesize that given such a work item identifying heuristic, we can identify bug-inducing commits more accurately than existing SZZ approaches.We then build a new variant of SZZ that we call Work Item Aware SZZ (WIA-SZZ), that leverages our work item detecting heuristic to first suggest bug-inducing commits.If our heuristic fails to find any candidates, we then fall back to baseline variants of SZZ.We conduct a manual evaluation to assess the accuracy of our heuristic to identify work items.Our evaluation reveals the heuristic is 64% accurate in finding work items, but most importantly it is able to find many bug-inducing commits.We then evaluate our approach on 821 repositories that have been previously used to study the performance of SZZ, comparing our work against six SZZ variants.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>That evaluation shows an improvement in F1 scores ranging from 2% to 9%, or when looking only at the subset of cases that found work item improved 3% to 14%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.653</span></span></p>

                  <p>Deploying robots in open-world environments involves complex tasks characterized by long sequences and rich interactions, necessitating efficient transfer of robotic skills across diverse and complex scenarios.To address this challenge, we propose a skill library framework based on knowledge graphs, which endows robots with high-level skill awareness and spatial semantic understanding.The framework hierarchically organizes operational knowledge by constructing a "task graph" and a "scene graph" to represent task and scene semantic information, respectively.We introduce a "state graph" to facilitate interaction between high-level task planning and low-level scene information.Furthermore, we propose a hierarchical transfer framework for operational skills.At the task level, the framework integrates contextual learning and chain-of-thought prompting within a four-stage prompt paradigm, leveraging large language models' (LLMs) reasoning and generalization capabilities to achieve task-level subtask sequence transfer.At the motion level, an adaptive trajectory transfer method is developed using the A* algorithm and the skill library, enabling motion-level adaptive trajectory transfer.At the physical level, we introduce an adaptive contour extraction and posture perception method based on tactile perception.This method dynamically obtains high-precision contour and posture information from visual-tactile texture data and adjusts transferred skills, such as contact positions and postures, to ensure effectiveness in new environments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.727</span></span>Project website:https://github.com/MingchaoQi/skill_transfer</p>

                  <p>The increasing complexity of AI models, especially in deep learning, has raised concerns about transparency and accountability, particularly in high-stakes applications like medical diagnostics, where opaque models can undermine trust.Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) aims to address these issues by providing clear, interpretable models.Among XAI techniques, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) enhance transparency by using high-level semantic concepts.However, CBMs are vulnerable to concept-level backdoor attacks, which inject hidden triggers into these concepts, leading to undetectable anomalous behavior.To address this critical security gap, we introduce ConceptGuard, a novel defense framework specifically designed to protect CBMs from concept-level backdoor attacks.ConceptGuard employs a multi-stage approach, including concept clustering based on text distance measurements and a voting mechanism among classifiers trained on different concept subgroups, to isolate and mitigate potential triggers.Our contributions are threefold: (i) we present ConceptGuard as the first defense mechanism tailored for concept-level backdoor attacks in CBMs; (ii) we provide theoretical guarantees that ConceptGuard can effectively defend against such attacks within a certain trigger size threshold, ensuring robustness; and (iii) we demonstrate that ConceptGuard maintains the high performance and interpretability of CBMs, crucial for trustworthiness.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through comprehensive experiments and theoretical proofs, we show that ConceptGuard significantly enhances the security and trustworthiness of CBMs, paving the way for their secure deployment in critical applications. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span></p>

                  <p>Static analyzers are typically complex tools and thus prone to contain bugs themselves.To increase the trust in the verdict of such tools, witnesses encode key reasoning steps underlying the verdict in an exchangeable format, enabling independent validation of the reasoning by other tools.For the correctness of concurrent programs, no agreed-upon witness format exists -- in no small part due to the divide between the semantics considered by analyzers, ranging from interleaving to thread-modular approaches, making it challenging to exchange information.We propose a format that leverages the well-known notion of ghosts to embed the claims a tool makes about a program into a modified program with ghosts, such that the validity of a witness can be decided by analyzing this program.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Thus, the validity of witnesses with respect to the interleaving and the thread-modular semantics coincides. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.609</span></span>Further, thread-modular invariants computed by an abstract interpreter can naturally be expressed in the new format using ghost statements.We evaluate the approach by generating such ghost witnesses for a subset of concurrent programs from the SV-COMP benchmark suite, and pass them to a model checker.It can confirm 75% of these witnesses -- indicating that ghost witnesses can bridge the semantic divide between interleaving and thread-modular approaches.</p>

                  <p>We prove direct-sum theorems for Wilber's two lower bounds[Wilber, FOCS'86] on the cost of access sequences in the binary search tree (BST) model.These bounds are central to the question of dynamic optimality [Sleator and Tarjan, JACM'85]: the Alternation bound is the only bound to have yielded online BST algorithms beating $\log n$ competitive ratio, while the Funnel bound has repeatedly been conjectured to exactly characterize the cost of executing an access sequence using the optimal tree[Wilber, FOCS'86, Kozma'16], and has been explicitly linked to splay trees[Levy and Tarjan, SODA'19].Previously, the direct-sum theorem for the Alternation bound was known only when approximation was allowed [Chalermsook, Chuzhoy and Saranurak, APPROX'20, ToC'24].   We use these direct-sum theorems to amplify the sequences from [Lecomte and Weinstein, ESA'20] that separate between Wilber's Alternation and Funnel bounds, increasing the Alternation and Funnel bounds while optimally maintaining the separation.As a corollary, we show that Tango trees[Demaine et al., FOCS'04] are optimal among any BST algorithms that charge their costs to the Alternation bound.This is true for any value of the Alternation bound, even values for which Tango trees achieve a competitive ratio of $o(\log \log n)$ instead of the default $O(\log \log n)$. Previously, the optimality of Tango trees was shown only for a limited range of Alternationbound<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>[Lecomte and Weinstein, ESA'20]. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential to enhance software development through automated code generation and refactoring, reducing development time and improving code quality.This study empirically evaluates StarCoder2, an LLM optimized for code generation, in refactoring code across 30 open-source Java projects.We compare StarCoder2's performance against human developers, focusing on (1) code quality improvements, (2) types and effectiveness of refactorings, and (3) enhancements through one-shot and chain-of-thought prompting.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results indicate that StarCoder2 reduces code smells by 20.1% more than developers, excelling in systematic issues like Long Statement and Magic Number, while developers handle complex, context-dependent issues better. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span>One-shot prompting increases the unit test pass rate by 6.15% and improves code smell reduction by 3.52%.Generating five refactorings per input further increases the pass rate by 28.8%, suggesting that combining one-shot prompting with multiple refactorings optimizes performance.These findings provide insights into StarCoder2's potential and best practices for integrating LLMs into software refactoring, supporting more efficient and effective code improvement in real-world applications.</p>
