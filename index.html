                  <p>This paper explores the intersection of technological innovation and access to justice by developing a benchmark for predicting case outcomes in the UK Employment Tribunal (UKET).To address the challenge of extensive manual annotation, the study employs a large language model (LLM) for automatic annotation, resulting in the creation of the CLC-UKET dataset.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset consists of approximately 19,000 UKET cases and their metadata. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.961</span></span>Comprehensive legal annotations cover facts, claims, precedent references, statutory references, case outcomes, reasons and jurisdiction codes.Facilitated by the CLC-UKET data, we examine a multi-class case outcome prediction task in the UKET.Human predictions are collected to establish a performance reference for model comparison.Empirical results from baseline models indicate that finetuned transformer models outperform zero-shot and few-shot LLMs on the UKET prediction task.The performance of zero-shot LLMs can be enhanced by integrating task-related information into few-shot examples.We hope that the CLC-UKET dataset, along with human annotations and empirical findings, can serve as a valuable benchmark for employment-related dispute resolution.</p>

                  <p>The examination of the musculoskeletal system in dogs is a challenging task in veterinary practice.In this work, a novel method has been developed that enables efficient documentation of a dog's condition through a visual representation.However, since the visual documentation is new, there is no existing training data.The objective of this work is therefore to mitigate the impact of data scarcity in order to develop an AI-based diagnostic support system.To this end, the potential of synthetic data that mimics realistic visual documentations of diseases for pre-training AI models is investigated.We propose a method for generating synthetic image data that mimics realistic visual documentations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Initially, a basic dataset containing three distinct classes is generated, followed by the creation of a more sophisticated dataset containing 36 different classes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.715</span></span>Both datasets are used for the pre-training of an AI model.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Subsequently, an evaluation dataset is created, consisting of 250 manually created visual documentations for five different diseases. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.757</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This dataset, along with a subset containing 25 examples. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.964</span></span>The obtained results on the evaluation dataset containing 25 examples demonstrate a significant enhancement of approximately 10% in diagnosis accuracy when utilizing generated synthetic images that mimic real-world visual documentations.However, these results do not hold true for the larger evaluation dataset containing 250 examples, indicating that the advantages of using synthetic data for pre-training an AI model emerge primarily when dealing with few examples of visual documentations for a given disease.Overall, this work provides valuable insights into mitigating the limitations imposed by limited training data through the strategic use of generated synthetic data, presenting an approach applicable beyond the canine musculoskeletal assessment domain.</p>

                  <p>Recent studies have identified that language models, pretrained on text-only datasets, often lack elementary visual knowledge, \textit{e.g.,} colors of everyday objects.Motivated by this observation, we ask whether a similar shortcoming exists in terms of the \textit{auditory} knowledge.To answer this question, we construct a new dataset called AuditoryBench, which consists of two novel tasks for evaluating auditory knowledge.Based on our analysis using the benchmark, we find that language models also suffer from a severe lack of auditory knowledge.To address this limitation, we propose AudioBERT, a novel method to augment the auditory knowledge of BERT through a retrieval-based approach.First, we detect auditory knowledge spans in prompts to query our retrieval model efficiently.Then, we inject audio knowledge into BERT and switch on low-rank adaptation for effective adaptation when audio knowledge is required.Our experiments demonstrate that AudioBERT is quite effective, achieving superior performance on the AuditoryBench.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset and code are available at \bulurl{https://github.com/HJ-Ok/AudioBERT}. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.766</span></span></p>

                  <p>Today's touch sensors come in many shapes and sizes.This has made it challenging to develop general-purpose touch processing methods since models are generally tied to one specific sensor design.We address this problem by performing cross-modal prediction between touch sensors: given the tactile signal from one sensor, we use a generative model to estimate how the same physical contact would be perceived by another sensor.This allows us to apply sensor-specific methods to the generated signal.We implement this idea by training a diffusion model to translate between the popular GelSlim and Soft Bubble sensors.As a downstream task, we perform in-hand object pose estimation using GelSlim sensors while using an algorithm that operates only on Soft Bubble signals.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset, the code, and additional details can be found at https://www.mmintlab.com/research/touch2touch/. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.86</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great promise in vulnerability identification.As C/C++ comprises half of the Open-Source Software (OSS) vulnerabilities over the past decade and updates in OSS mainly occur through commits, enhancing LLMs' ability to identify C/C++ Vulnerability-Contributing Commits (VCCs) is essential.However, current studies primarily focus on further pre-training LLMs on massive code datasets, which is resource-intensive and poses efficiency challenges.In this paper, we enhance the ability of BERT-based LLMs to identify C/C++ VCCs in a lightweight manner.We propose CodeLinguaNexus (CLNX) as a bridge facilitating communication between C/C++ programs and LLMs.Based on commits, CLNX efficiently converts the source code into a more natural representation while preserving key details.Specifically, CLNX first applies structure-level naturalization to decompose complex programs, followed by token-level naturalization to interpret complex symbols.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate CLNX on public datasets of 25,872 C/C++ functions with their commits. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.748</span></span>The results show that CLNX significantly enhances the performance of LLMs on identifying C/C++ VCCs.Moreover, CLNX-equipped CodeBERT achieves new state-of-the-art and identifies 38 OSS vulnerabilities in the real world.</p>

                  <p>Over the past decade, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved great success on machine learning tasks with relational data.However, recent studies have found that heterophily can cause significant performance degradation of GNNs, especially on node-level tasks.Numerous heterophilic benchmark datasets have been put forward to validate the efficacy of heterophily-specific GNNs and various homophily metrics have been designed to help people recognize these malignant datasets.Nevertheless, there still exist multiple pitfalls that severely hinder the proper evaluation of new models and metrics.In this paper, we point out three most serious pitfalls: 1) a lack of hyperparameter tuning; 2) insufficient model evaluation on the real challenging heterophilic datasets; 3) missing quantitative evaluation benchmark for homophily metrics on synthetic graphs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To overcome these challenges, we first train and fine-tune baseline models on $27$ most widely used benchmark datasets, categorize them into three distinct groups: malignant, benign and ambiguous heterophilic datasets, and identify the real challenging subsets of tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.71</span></span>To our best knowledge, we are the first to propose such taxonomy.Then, we re-evaluate $10$ heterophily-specific state-of-the-arts (SOTA) GNNs with fine-tuned hyperparameters on different groups of heterophilic datasets.Based on the model performance, we reassess their effectiveness on addressing heterophily challenge.At last, we evaluate $11$ popular homophily metrics on synthetic graphs with three different generation approaches.To compare the metrics strictly, we propose the first quantitative evaluation method based on Fr\'echet distance.</p>

                  <p>Synthesizing 3D whole-bodies that realistically grasp objects is useful for animation, mixed reality, and robotics.This is challenging, because the hands and body need to look natural w.r.t.each other, the grasped object, as well as the local scene (i.e., a receptacle supporting the object).Only recent work tackles this, with a divide-and-conquer approach; it first generates a "guiding" right-hand grasp, and then searches for bodies that match this.However, the guiding-hand synthesis lacks controllability and receptacle awareness, so it likely has an implausible direction (i.e., a body can't match this without penetrating the receptacle) and needs corrections through major post-processing.Moreover, the body search needs exhaustive sampling and is expensive.These are strong limitations.We tackle these with a novel method called CWGrasp.Our key idea is that performing geometry-based reasoning "early on," instead of "too late," provides rich "control" signals for inference.To this end, CWGrasp first samples a plausible reaching-direction vector (used later for both the arm and hand) from a probabilistic model built via raycasting from the object and collision checking.Then, it generates a reaching body with a desired arm direction, as well as a "guiding" grasping hand with a desired palm direction that complies with the arm's one.Eventually, CWGrasp refines the body to match the "guiding" hand, while plausibly contacting the scene.Notably, generating already-compatible "parts" greatly simplifies the "whole."Moreover, CWGrasp uniquely tackles both right- and left-hand grasps.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate on the GRAB and ReplicaGrasp datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.72</span></span>CWGrasp outperforms baselines, at lower runtime and budget, while all components help performance.Code and models will be released.</p>

                  <p>Ranked enumeration is a query-answering paradigm where the query answers are returned incrementally in order of importance (instead of returning all answers at once).Importance is defined by a ranking function that can be specific to the application, but typically involves either a lexicographic order (e.g., "ORDER BY R.A, S.B" in SQL) or a weighted sum of attributes (e.g., "ORDER BY 3*R.A + 2*S.B").We recently introduced any-k algorithms for (multi-way) join queries, which push ranking into joins and avoid materializing intermediate results until necessary.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The top-ranked answers are returned asymptotically faster than the common join-then-rank approach of database systems, resulting in orders-of-magnitude speedup in practice.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.634</span></span>In addition to their practical usefulness, our techniques complement a long line of theoretical research on unranked enumeration, where answers are also returned incrementally, but with no explicit ordering requirement.For a broad class of ranking functions with certain monotonicity properties, including lexicographic orders and sum-based rankings, the ordering requirement surprisingly does not increase the asymptotic time or space complexity, apart from logarithmic factors.   A key insight of our work is the connection between ranked enumeration for database queries and the fundamental task of computing the kth-shortest path in a graph.Uncovering these connections allowed us to ground our approach in the rich literature of that problem and connect ideas that had been explored in isolation before.In this article, we adopt a pragmatic approach and present a slightly simplified version of the algorithm without the shortest-path interpretation.We believe that this will benefit practitioners looking to implement and optimize any-k approaches.</p>

                  <p>Graph neural networks have become the default choice by practitioners for graph learning tasks such as graph classification and node classification.Nevertheless, popular graph neural network models still struggle to capture higher-order information, i.e., information that goes \emph{beyond} pairwise interactions.Recent work has shown that persistent homology, a tool from topological data analysis, can enrich graph neural networks with topological information that they otherwise could not capture.Calculating such features is efficient for dimension 0 (connected components) and dimension 1 (cycles).However, when it comes to higher-order structures, it does not scale well, with a complexity of $O(n^d)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes and $d$ is the order of the structures.In this work, we introduce a novel method that extracts information about higher-order structures in the graph while still using the efficient low-dimensional persistent homology algorithm.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>On standard benchmark datasets, we show that our method can lead to up to $31\%$ improvements in test accuracy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.758</span></span></p>

                  <p>Twitter is recognized as a crucial platform for the dissemination and gathering of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI).Its capability to provide real-time, actionable intelligence makes it an indispensable tool for detecting security events, helping security professionals cope with ever-growing threats.However, the large volume of tweets and inherent noises of human-crafted tweets pose significant challenges in accurately identifying security events.While many studies tried to filter out event-related tweets based on keywords, they are not effective due to their limitation in understanding the semantics of tweets.Another challenge in security event detection from Twitter is the comprehensive coverage of security events.Previous studies emphasized the importance of early detection of security events, but they overlooked the importance of event coverage.To cope with these challenges, in our study, we introduce a novel event attribution-centric tweet embedding method to enable the high precision and coverage of events.Our experiment result shows that the proposed method outperforms existing text and graph-based tweet embedding methods in identifying security events.Leveraging this novel embedding approach, we have developed and implemented a framework, Tweezers, that is applicable to security event detection from Twitter for CTI gathering.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This framework has demonstrated its effectiveness, detecting twice as many events compared to established baselines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.608</span></span>Additionally, we have showcased two applications, built on Tweezers for the integration and inspection of security events, i.e., security event trend analysis and informative security user identification.</p>

                  <p>Panoptic narrative grounding (PNG), whose core target is fine-grained image-text alignment, requires a panoptic segmentation of referred objects given a narrative caption.Previous discriminative methods achieve only weak or coarse-grained alignment by panoptic segmentation pretraining or CLIP model adaptation.Given the recent progress of text-to-image Diffusion models, several works have shown their capability to achieve fine-grained image-text alignment through cross-attention maps and improved general segmentation performance.However, the direct use of phrase features as static prompts to apply frozen Diffusion models to the PNG task still suffers from a large task gap and insufficient vision-language interaction, yielding inferior performance.Therefore, we propose an Extractive-Injective Phrase Adapter (EIPA) bypass within the Diffusion UNet to dynamically update phrase prompts with image features and inject the multimodal cues back, which leverages the fine-grained image-text alignment capability of Diffusion models more sufficiently.In addition, we also design a Multi-Level Mutual Aggregation (MLMA) module to reciprocally fuse multi-level image and phrase features for segmentation refinement.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on the PNG benchmark show that our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span></p>

                  <p>The discrete Laplacian operator holds a crucial role in 3D geometry processing, yet it is still challenging to define it on point clouds.Previous works mainly focused on constructing a local triangulation around each point to approximate the underlying manifold for defining the Laplacian operator, which may not be robust or accurate.In contrast, we simply use the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) graph constructed from the input point cloud and learn the Laplacian operator on the KNN graph with graph neural networks (GNNs).However, the ground-truth Laplacian operator is defined on a manifold mesh with a different connectivity from the KNN graph and thus cannot be directly used for training.To train the GNN, we propose a novel training scheme by imitating the behavior of the ground-truth Laplacian operator on a set of probe functions so that the learned Laplacian operator behaves similarly to the ground-truth Laplacian operator.We train our network on a subset of ShapeNet and evaluate it across a variety of point clouds.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Compared with previous methods, our method reduces the error by an order of magnitude and excels in handling sparse point clouds with thin structures or sharp features. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.6</span></span>Our method also demonstrates a strong generalization ability to unseen shapes.With our learned Laplacian operator, we further apply a series of Laplacian-based geometry processing algorithms directly to point clouds and achieve accurate results, enabling many exciting possibilities for geometry processing on point clouds.The code and trained models are available at https://github.com/IntelligentGeometry/NeLo.</p>

                  <p>Image vectorization is a process to convert a raster image into a scalable vector graphic format.Objective is to effectively remove the pixelization effect while representing boundaries of image by scaleable parameterized curves.We propose new image vectorization with depth which considers depth ordering among shapes and use curvature-based inpainting for convexifying shapes in vectorization process.From a given color quantized raster image, we first define each connected component of the same color as a shape layer, and construct depth ordering among them using a newly proposed depth ordering energy.Global depth ordering among all shapes is described by a directed graph, and we propose an energy to remove cycle within the graph.After constructing depth ordering of shapes, we convexify occluded regions by Euler's elastica curvature-based variational inpainting, and leverage on the stability of Modica-Mortola double-well potential energy to inpaint large regions.This is following human vision perception that boundaries of shapes extend smoothly, and we assume shapes are likely to be convex.Finally, we fit B\'{e}zier curves to the boundaries and save vectorization as a SVG file which allows superposition of curvature-based inpainted shapes following the depth ordering.This is a new way to vectorize images, by decomposing an image into scalable shape layers with computed depth ordering.This approach makes editing shapes and images more natural and intuitive.We also consider grouping shape layers for semantic vectorization.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We present various numerical results and comparisons against recent layer-based vectorization methods to validate the proposed model. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.639</span></span></p>

                  <p>Outlier detection (OD) has a vast literature as it finds numerous applications in environmental monitoring, cybersecurity, finance, and medicine to name a few.Being an inherently unsupervised task, model selection is a key bottleneck for OD (both algorithm and hyperparameter selection) without label supervision.There is a long list of techniques to choose from -- both classical algorithms and deep neural architectures -- and while several studies report their hyperparameter sensitivity, the literature is quite slim on unsupervised model selection -- limiting the effective use of OD in practice.In this paper we present FoMo-0D, for zero/0-shot OD exploring a transformative new direction that bypasses the hurdle of model selection altogether (!), thus breaking new ground.The fundamental idea behind FoMo-0D is the Prior-data Fitted Networks, recently introduced by Muller et al.(2022), which trains a Transformer model on a large body of synthetically generated data from a prior data distribution.In essence, FoMo-0D is a pretrained Foundation Model for zero/0-shot OD on tabular data, which can directly predict the (outlier/inlier) label of any test data at inference time, by merely a single forward pass -- making obsolete the need for choosing an algorithm/architecture, tuning its associated hyperparameters, and even training any model parameters when given a new OD dataset.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on 57 public benchmark datasets against 26 baseline methods show that FoMo-0D performs statistically no different from the top 2nd baseline, while significantly outperforming the majority of the baselines, with an average inference time of 7.7 ms per test sample. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.63</span></span></p>

                  <p>Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) or Speech-to-text (STT) has greatly evolved in the last few years.Traditional architectures based on pipelines have been replaced by joint end-to-end (E2E) architectures that simplify and streamline the model training process.In addition, new AI training methods, such as weak-supervised learning have reduced the need for high-quality audio datasets for model training.However, despite all these advancements, little to no research has been done on real-time transcription.In real-time scenarios, the audio is not pre-recorded, and the input audio must be fragmented to be processed by the ASR systems.To achieve real-time requirements, these fragments must be as short as possible to reduce latency.However, audio cannot be split at any point as dividing an utterance into two separate fragments will generate an incorrect transcription.Also, shorter fragments provide less context for the ASR model.For this reason, it is necessary to design and test different splitting algorithms to optimize the quality and delay of the resulting transcription.In this paper, three audio splitting algorithms are evaluated with different ASR models to determine their impact on both the quality of the transcription and the end-to-end delay.The algorithms are fragmentation at fixed intervals, voice activity detection (VAD), and fragmentation with feedback.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results are compared to the performance of the same model, without audio fragmentation, to determine the effects of this division. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.622</span></span>The results show that VAD fragmentation provides the best quality with the highest delay, whereas fragmentation at fixed intervals provides the lowest quality and the lowest delay.The newly proposed feedback algorithm exchanges a 2-4% increase in WER for a reduction of 1.5-2s delay, respectively, to the VAD splitting.</p>

                  <p>Over the past decade, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved great success on machine learning tasks with relational data.However, recent studies have found that heterophily can cause significant performance degradation of GNNs, especially on node-level tasks.Numerous heterophilic benchmark datasets have been put forward to validate the efficacy of heterophily-specific GNNs and various homophily metrics have been designed to help people recognize these malignant datasets.Nevertheless, there still exist multiple pitfalls that severely hinder the proper evaluation of new models and metrics.In this paper, we point out three most serious pitfalls: 1) a lack of hyperparameter tuning; 2) insufficient model evaluation on the real challenging heterophilic datasets; 3) missing quantitative evaluation benchmark for homophily metrics on synthetic graphs.To overcome these challenges, we first train and fine-tune baseline models on $27$ most widely used benchmark datasets, categorize them into three distinct groups: malignant, benign and ambiguous heterophilic datasets, and identify the real challenging subsets of tasks.To our best knowledge, we are the first to propose such taxonomy.Then, we re-evaluate $10$ heterophily-specific state-of-the-arts (SOTA) GNNs with fine-tuned hyperparameters on different groups of heterophilic datasets.Based on the model performance, we reassess their effectiveness on addressing heterophily challenge.At last, we evaluate $11$ popular homophily metrics on synthetic graphs with three different generation approaches.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To compare the metrics strictly, we propose the first quantitative evaluation method based on Fr\'echet distance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.706</span></span></p>

                  <p>State-of-the-art techniques for 3D reconstruction are largely based on volumetric scene representations, which require sampling multiple points to compute the color arriving along a ray.Using these representations for more general inverse rendering -- reconstructing geometry, materials, and lighting from observed images -- is challenging because recursively path-tracing such volumetric representations is expensive.Recent works alleviate this issue through the use of radiance caches: data structures that store the steady-state, infinite-bounce radiance arriving at any point from any direction.However, these solutions rely on approximations that introduce bias into the renderings and, more importantly, into the gradients used for optimization.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We present a method that avoids these approximations while remaining computationally efficient. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.69</span></span>In particular, we leverage two techniques to reduce variance for unbiased estimators of the rendering equation: (1) an occlusion-aware importance sampler for incoming illumination and (2) a fast cache architecture that can be used as a control variate for the radiance from a high-quality, but more expensive, volumetric cache.We show that by removing these biases our approach improves the generality of radiance cache based inverse rendering, as well as increasing quality in the presence of challenging light transport effects such as specular reflections.</p>

                  <p>Humans perceive the world through multisensory integration, blending the information of different modalities to adapt their behavior.Contrastive learning offers an appealing solution for multimodal self-supervised learning.Indeed, by considering each modality as a different view of the same entity, it learns to align features of different modalities in a shared representation space.However, this approach is intrinsically limited as it only learns shared or redundant information between modalities, while multimodal interactions can arise in other ways.In this work, we introduce CoMM, a Contrastive MultiModal learning strategy that enables the communication between modalities in a single multimodal space.Instead of imposing cross- or intra- modality constraints, we propose to align multimodal representations by maximizing the mutual information between augmented versions of these multimodal features.Our theoretical analysis shows that shared, synergistic and unique terms of information naturally emerge from this formulation, allowing us to estimate multimodal interactions beyond redundancy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We test CoMM both in a controlled and in a series of real-world settings: in the former, we demonstrate that CoMM effectively captures redundant, unique and synergistic information between modalities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.638</span></span>In the latter, CoMM learns complex multimodal interactions and achieves state-of-the-art results on the six multimodal benchmarks.</p>

Results: RIA, as a regulatory RE process, is conducted to address the needs of executive management and central functions.It involves coordination between different functions and levels of enterprise hierarchy.Enterprises use artifacts to support interpretation and communication of the results of RIA.Challenges to RIA are mainly related to the execution of such coordination and managing the knowledge involved.   Conclusion: RIA in large enterprises demands close coordination of multiple stakeholders and roles.Applying interpretation and compliance artifacts is one approach to support such coordination.However, there are no established practices for creating and managing such artifacts.</p>
