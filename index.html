                  <p>Event cameras are bio-inspired sensors that capture the intensity changes asynchronously and output event streams with distinct advantages, such as high temporal resolution.To exploit event cameras for object/action recognition, existing methods predominantly sample and aggregate events in a second-level duration at every fixed temporal interval (or frequency).However, they often face difficulties in capturing the spatiotemporal relationships for longer, e.g., minute-level, events and generalizing across varying temporal frequencies.To fill the gap, we present a novel framework, dubbed PAST-SSM, exhibiting superior capacity in recognizing events with arbitrary duration (e.g., 0.1s to 4.5s) and generalizing to varying inference frequencies.Our key insight is to learn the spatiotemporal relationships from the encoded event features via the state space model (SSM) -- whose linear complexity makes it ideal for modeling high temporal resolution events with longer sequences.To achieve this goal, we first propose a Path-Adaptive Event Aggregation and Scan (PEAS) module to encode events of varying duration into features with fixed dimensions by adaptively scanning and selecting aggregated event frames.On top of PEAS, we introduce a novel Multi-faceted Selection Guiding (MSG) loss to minimize the randomness and redundancy of the encoded features.This subtly enhances the model generalization across different inference frequencies.Lastly, the SSM is employed to better learn the spatiotemporal properties from the encoded features.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, we build a minute-level event-based recognition dataset, named ArDVS100, with arbitrary duration for the benefit of the community. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.778</span></span>Extensive experiments prove that our method outperforms prior arts by +3.45%, +0.38% and +8.31% on the DVS Action, SeAct and HARDVS datasets, respectively.</p>

                  <p>Event cameras are innovative neuromorphic sensors that asynchronously capture the scene dynamics.Due to the event-triggering mechanism, such cameras record event streams with much shorter response latency and higher intensity sensitivity compared to conventional cameras.On the basis of these features, previous works have attempted to reconstruct high dynamic range (HDR) videos from events, but have either suffered from unrealistic artifacts or failed to provide sufficiently high frame rates.In this paper, we present a recurrent convolutional neural network that reconstruct high-speed HDR videos from event sequences, with a key frame guidance to prevent potential error accumulation caused by the sparse event data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, to address the problem of severely limited real dataset, we develop a new optical system to collect a real-world dataset with paired high-speed HDR videos and event streams, facilitating future research in this field. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.704</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our dataset provides the first real paired dataset for event-to-HDR reconstruction, avoiding potential inaccuracies from simulation strategies. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.708</span></span>Experimental results demonstrate that our method can generate high-quality, high-speed HDR videos.We further explore the potential of our work in cross-camera reconstruction and downstream computer vision tasks, including object detection, panoramic segmentation, optical flow estimation, and monocular depth estimation under HDR scenarios.</p>

                  <p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) are powerful for cognitive tasks such as image classification, object detection, and scene segmentation.One drawback however is the significant high computational complexity and memory consumption, which makes them unfeasible to run real-time on embedded platforms because of the limited hardware resources.Block floating point (BFP) quantization is one of the representative compression approaches for reducing the memory and computational burden owing to their capability to effectively capture the broad data distribution of DNN models.Unfortunately, prior works on BFP-based quantization empirically choose the block size and the precision that preserve accuracy.In this paper, we develop a BFP-based bitwidth-aware analytical modeling framework (called ``BitQ'') for the best BFP implementation of DNN inference on embedded platforms.We formulate and resolve an optimization problem to identify the optimal BFP block size and bitwidth distribution by the trade-off of both accuracy and performance loss.Experimental results show that compared with an equal bitwidth setting, the BFP DNNs with optimized bitwidth allocation provide efficient computation, preserving accuracy on famous benchmarks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The source code and data are available at https://github.com/Cheliosoops/BitQ. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.796</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language model pre-training has traditionally relied on human experts to craft heuristics for improving the corpora quality, resulting in numerous rules developed to date.However, these rules lack the flexibility to address the unique characteristics of individual example effectively.Meanwhile, applying tailored rules to every example is impractical for human experts.In this paper, we demonstrate that even small language models, with as few as 0.3B parameters, can exhibit substantial data refining capabilities comparable to those of human experts.We introduce Programming Every Example (ProX), a novel framework that treats data refinement as a programming task, enabling models to refine corpora by generating and executing fine-grained operations, such as string normalization, for each individual example at scale.Experimental results show that models pre-trained on ProX-curated data outperform either original data or data filtered by other selection methods by more than 2% across various downstream benchmarks.Its effectiveness spans various model sizes and pre-training corpora, including C4, RedPajama-V2, and FineWeb.Furthermore, ProX exhibits significant potential in domain-specific continual pre-training: without domain specific design, models trained on OpenWebMath refined by ProX outperform human-crafted rule-based methods, improving average accuracy by 7.6% over Mistral-7B, with 14.6% for Llama-2-7B and 20.3% for CodeLlama-7B, all within 10B tokens to be comparable to models like Llemma-7B trained on 200B tokens.Further analysis highlights that ProX significantly saves training FLOPs, offering a promising path for efficient LLM pre-training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We are open-sourcing ProX with >100B corpus, models, and sharing all training and implementation details for reproducible research and future innovation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.76</span></span>Code: https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/ProX</p>

Estimation of coverage rates of spray deposition in a class-wise manner allows for further understanding of effectiveness of precision spraying systems.Our study evaluates different Class Activation Mapping techniques, namely AblationCAM and ScoreCAM, to determine which is more effective and interpretable for these tasks.In the pipeline, inference-only feature fusion is used to allow for further interpretability and to enable the automation of precision spraying evaluation post-spray.Our findings indicate that a Fully Convolutional Network with an EfficientNet-B0 backbone and inference-only feature fusion achieves an average absolute difference in deposition values of 156.8 {\mu}L across three classes in our test set.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset curated in this paper is publicly available at https://github.com/Harry-Rogers/PSIE <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.804</span></span></p>

                  <p>The Big Data explosion has necessitated the development of search algorithms that scale sub-linearly in time and memory.   While compression algorithms and search algorithms do exist independently, few algorithms offer both, and those which do are domain-specific.   We present panCAKES, a novel approach to compressive search, i.e., a way to perform $k$-NN and $\rho$-NN search on compressed data while only decompressing a small, relevant, portion of the data.   panCAKES assumes the manifold hypothesis and leverages the low-dimensional structure of the data to compress and search it efficiently.   panCAKES is generic over any distance function for which the distance between two points is proportional to the memory cost of storing an encoding of one in terms of the other.   This property holds for many widely-used distance functions, e.g. string edit distances (Levenshtein, Needleman-Wunsch, etc.) and set dissimilarity measures (Jaccard, Dice, etc.).   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We benchmark panCAKES on a variety of datasets, including genomic, proteomic, and set data.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.768</span></span>We compare compression ratios to gzip, and search performance between the compressed and uncompressed versions of the same dataset.   panCAKES achieves compression ratios close to those of gzip, while offering sub-linear time performance for $k$-NN and $\rho$-NN search.   We conclude that panCAKES is an efficient, general-purpose algorithm for exact compressive search on large datasets that obey the manifold hypothesis.   We provide an open-source implementation of panCAKES in the Rust programming language.</p>

                  <p>There is a class of entropy-coding methods which do not substitute symbols by code words (such as Huffman coding), but operate on intervals or ranges.This class includes three prominent members: conventional arithmetic coding, range coding, and coding based on asymmetric numeral systems.To determine the correct symbol in the decoder, each of these methods requires the comparison of a state variable with subinterval boundaries.In adaptive operation, considering varying symbol statistics, an array of interval boundaries must additionally be kept up to date.The larger the symbol alphabet, the more time-consuming both the search for the correct subinterval and the updating of interval borders become.   Detailed pseudo-code is used to discuss different approaches to speed up the symbol search in the decoder and the adaptation of the array of interval borders, both depending on the chosen alphabet size.It is shown that reducing the $\mathcal{O}$-complexity does not lead to an acceleration in practical implementations if the alphabet size is too small.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In adaptive compression mode, the binary indexing method proves to be superior when considering the overall processing time. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.646</span></span>Although the symbol search (in the decoder) takes longer than with other algorithms, the faster updating of the array of interval borders more than compensates for this disadvantage.A variant of the binary indexing method is proposed, which is more flexible and has a partially lower complexity than the original approach.</p>

                  <p>Nowadays, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are commonly used in search and rescue scenarios to gather information in the search area.The automatic identification of the person searched for in aerial footage could increase the autonomy of such systems, reduce the search time, and thus increase the missed person's chances of survival.In this paper, we present a novel approach to perform semantically conditioned open vocabulary object tracking that is specifically designed to cope with the limitations of UAV hardware.Our approach has several advantages.It can run with verbal descriptions of the missing person, e.g., the color of the shirt, it does not require dedicated training to execute the mission and can efficiently track a potentially moving person.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experimental results demonstrate the versatility and efficacy of our approach. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.626</span></span></p>

                  <p>To mitigate risks from AI systems, we need to assess their capabilities accurately.This is especially difficult in cases where capabilities are only rarely displayed.Phuong et al. propose two methods that aim to obtain better estimates of the probability of an AI agent successfully completing a given task.The milestone method decomposes tasks into subtasks, aiming to improve overall success rate estimation, while the expert best-of-N method leverages human guidance as a proxy for the model's independent performance.   Our analysis of these methods as Monte Carlo estimators reveals that while both effectively reduce variance compared to naive Monte Carlo sampling, they also introduce bias.Experimental results demonstrate that the milestone method underestimates true solve rates for many real-world tasks due to its constraining assumptions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The expert best-of-N method exhibits even more severe underestimation across all tasks, attributed to an inherently flawed re-weighting factor. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span>To enhance the accuracy of capability estimates of AI agents on difficult tasks, we suggest future work should leverage the rich literature on Monte Carlo Estimators.</p>

                  <p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a popular solution to mitigate the hallucination issues of large language models.However, existing studies on RAG seldom address the issue of predictive uncertainty, i.e., how likely it is that a RAG model's prediction is incorrect, resulting in uncontrollable risks in real-world applications.In this work, we emphasize the importance of risk control, ensuring that RAG models proactively refuse to answer questions with low confidence.Our research identifies two critical latent factors affecting RAG's confidence in its predictions: the quality of the retrieved results and the manner in which these results are utilized.To guide RAG models in assessing their own confidence based on these two latent factors, we develop a counterfactual prompting framework that induces the models to alter these factors and analyzes the effect on their answers.We also introduce a benchmarking procedure to collect answers with the option to abstain, facilitating a series of experiments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For evaluation, we introduce several risk-related metrics and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span></p>

                  <p>Character video synthesis aims to produce realistic videos of animatable characters within lifelike scenes.As a fundamental problem in the computer vision and graphics community, 3D works typically require multi-view captures for per-case training, which severely limits their applicability of modeling arbitrary characters in a short time.Recent 2D methods break this limitation via pre-trained diffusion models, but they struggle for pose generality and scene interaction.To this end, we propose MIMO, a novel framework which can not only synthesize character videos with controllable attributes (i.e., character, motion and scene) provided by simple user inputs, but also simultaneously achieve advanced scalability to arbitrary characters, generality to novel 3D motions, and applicability to interactive real-world scenes in a unified framework.The core idea is to encode the 2D video to compact spatial codes, considering the inherent 3D nature of video occurrence.Concretely, we lift the 2D frame pixels into 3D using monocular depth estimators, and decompose the video clip to three spatial components (i.e., main human, underlying scene, and floating occlusion) in hierarchical layers based on the 3D depth.These components are further encoded to canonical identity code, structured motion code and full scene code, which are utilized as control signals of synthesis process.The design of spatial decomposed modeling enables flexible user control, complex motion expression, as well as 3D-aware synthesis for scene interactions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results demonstrate effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.754</span></span></p>

                  <p>Fine-tuning is arguably the most straightforward way to tailor a pre-trained model (e.g., a foundation model) to downstream applications, but it also comes with the risk of losing valuable knowledge the model had learned in pre-training.For example, fine-tuning a pre-trained classifier capable of recognizing a large number of classes to master a subset of classes at hand is shown to drastically degrade the model's accuracy in the other classes it had previously learned.As such, it is hard to further use the fine-tuned model when it encounters classes beyond the fine-tuning data.In this paper, we systematically dissect the issue, aiming to answer the fundamental question, ''What has been damaged in the fine-tuned model?''To our surprise, we find that the fine-tuned model neither forgets the relationship among the other classes nor degrades the features to recognize these classes.Instead, the fine-tuned model often produces more discriminative features for these other classes, even if they were missing during fine-tuning!{What really hurts the accuracy is the discrepant logit scales between the fine-tuning classes and the other classes}, implying that a simple post-processing calibration would bring back the pre-trained model's capability and at the same time unveil the feature improvement over all classes.We conduct an extensive empirical study to demonstrate the robustness of our findings and provide preliminary explanations underlying them, suggesting new directions for future theoretical analysis.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code is available at https://github.com/OSU-MLB/Fine-Tuning-Is-Fine-If-Calibrated. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.619</span></span></p>

                  <p>Robotic assistive feeding holds significant promise for improving the quality of life for individuals with eating disabilities.However, acquiring diverse food items under varying conditions and generalizing to unseen food presents unique challenges.Existing methods that rely on surface-level geometric information (e.g., bounding box and pose) derived from visual cues (e.g., color, shape, and texture) often lacks adaptability and robustness, especially when foods share similar physical properties but differ in visual appearance.We employ imitation learning (IL) to learn a policy for food acquisition.Existing methods employ IL or Reinforcement Learning (RL) to learn a policy based on off-the-shelf image encoders such as ResNet-50.However, such representations are not robust and struggle to generalize across diverse acquisition scenarios.To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach, IMRL (Integrated Multi-Dimensional Representation Learning), which integrates visual, physical, temporal, and geometric representations to enhance the robustness and generalizability of IL for food acquisition.Our approach captures food types and physical properties (e.g., solid, semi-solid, granular, liquid, and mixture), models temporal dynamics of acquisition actions, and introduces geometric information to determine optimal scooping points and assess bowl fullness.IMRL enables IL to adaptively adjust scooping strategies based on context, improving the robot's capability to handle diverse food acquisition scenarios.Experiments on a real robot demonstrate our approach's robustness and adaptability across various foods and bowl configurations, including zero-shot generalization to unseen settings.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our approach achieves improvement up to $35\%$ in success rate compared with the best-performing baseline. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.714</span></span></p>

                  <p>Federated learning offers a paradigm to the challenge of preserving privacy in distributed machine learning.However, datasets distributed across each client in the real world are inevitably heterogeneous, and if the datasets can be globally aggregated, they tend to be long-tailed distributed, which greatly affects the performance of the model.The traditional approach to federated learning primarily addresses the heterogeneity of data among clients, yet it fails to address the phenomenon of class-wise bias in global long-tailed data.This results in the trained model focusing on the head classes while neglecting the equally important tail classes.Consequently, it is essential to develop a methodology that considers classes holistically.To address the above problems, we propose a new method FedLF, which introduces three modifications in the local training phase: adaptive logit adjustment, continuous class centred optimization, and feature decorrelation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We compare seven state-of-the-art methods with varying degrees of data heterogeneity and long-tailed distribution. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.642</span></span>Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets CIFAR-10-LT and CIFAR-100-LT demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates the problem of model performance degradation due to data heterogeneity and long-tailed distribution.our code is available at https://github.com/18sym/FedLF.</p>

                  <p>This research analyzed the performance and consistency of four synchronization mechanisms-reentrant locks, semaphores, synchronized methods, and synchronized blocks-across three operating systems: macOS, Windows, and Linux.Synchronization ensures that concurrent processes or threads access shared resources safely, and efficient synchronization is vital for maintaining system performance and reliability.The study aimed to identify the synchronization mechanism that balances efficiency, measured by execution time, and consistency, assessed by variance and standard deviation, across platforms.The initial hypothesis proposed that mutex-based mechanisms, specifically synchronized methods and blocks, would be the most efficient due to their simplicity.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, empirical results showed that reentrant locks had the lowest average execution time (14.67ms), making them the most efficient mechanism, but with the highest variability (standard deviation of 1.15). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.637</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In contrast, synchronized methods, blocks, and semaphores exhibited higher average execution times (16.33ms for methods and 16.67ms for blocks) but with greater consistency (variance of 0.33). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.669</span></span>The findings indicated that while reentrant locks were faster, they were more platform-dependent, whereas mutex-based mechanisms provided more predictable performance across all operating systems.The use of virtual machines for Windows and Linux was a limitation, potentially affecting the results.Future research should include native testing and explore additional synchronization mechanisms and higher concurrency levels.These insights help developers and system designers optimize synchronization strategies for either performance or stability, depending on the application's requirements.</p>

                  <p>The variety of today's multicore architectures motivates researchers to explore parallel scientific applications on different platforms.Load imbalance is one performance issue that can prejudice parallel applications from exploiting the computational power of these platforms.Ondes3D is a scientific application for seismic wave simulation used to assess the geological impact of earthquakes.Its parallelism relies on applying a regular domain decomposition in the geological domain provided and distributing each sub-domain to MPI ranks.Previous works investigate the significant spatial and temporal imbalance in Ondes3D and suggest new parallelization and load balancing techniques to minimize them.However, none explored its execution on different architectures.Our paper evaluates the performance of Ondes3D for two earthquake scenarios on eight different multicore architectures, including Intel, AMD, and ARM processors.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We measure the load distribution per MPI rank, evaluate the temporal load imbalance, and compare the execution of the application's kernels. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span>Our results show that the temporal load imbalance in Ondes3D depends on the architecture chosen, with some platforms minimizing such imbalance more effectively.</p>

                  <p>One of the key issues contributing to inefficiency in Puskesmas is the time-consuming nature of doctor-patient interactions.Doctors need to conduct thorough consultations, which include diagnosing the patient's condition, providing treatment advice, and transcribing detailed notes into medical records.In regions with diverse linguistic backgrounds, doctors often have to ask clarifying questions, further prolonging the process.While diagnosing is essential, transcription and summarization can often be automated using AI to improve time efficiency and help doctors enhance care quality and enable early diagnosis and intervention.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper proposes a solution using a localized large language model (LLM) to transcribe, translate, and summarize doctor-patient conversations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span>We utilize the Whisper model for transcription and GPT-3 to summarize them into the ePuskemas medical records format.This system is implemented as an add-on to an existing web browser extension, allowing doctors to fill out patient forms while talking.By leveraging this solution for real-time transcription, translation, and summarization, doctors can improve the turnaround time for patient care while enhancing the quality of records, which become more detailed and insightful for future visits.This innovation addresses challenges like overcrowded facilities and the administrative burden on healthcare providers in Indonesia.We believe this solution will help doctors save time, provide better care, and produce more accurate medical records, representing a significant step toward modernizing healthcare and ensuring patients receive timely, high-quality care, even in resource-constrained settings.</p>

Methodology:We conducted an exploratory interview study of RIA in three large enterprises.We focused on how they conduct RIA, emphasizing cross-functional interactions, and using the EAA as an example.   Results: RIA, as a regulatory RE process, is conducted to address the needs of executive management and central functions.It involves coordination between different functions and levels of enterprise hierarchy.Enterprises use artifacts to support interpretation and communication of the results of RIA.Challenges to RIA are mainly related to the execution of such coordination and managing the knowledge involved.   Conclusion: RIA in large enterprises demands close coordination of multiple stakeholders and roles.Applying interpretation and compliance artifacts is one approach to support such coordination.However, there are no established practices for creating and managing such artifacts.</p>
