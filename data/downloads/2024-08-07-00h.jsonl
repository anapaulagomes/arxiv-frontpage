The approach aims to quantify and compare the contributions of different state dimensions to various action choices. To more accurately analyze these impacts, we introduce new characteristic value functions, the ``Counterfactual Difference Characteristic Value\" and the ``Average Counterfactual Difference Characteristic Value.\" These functions help calculate the Shapley values to evaluate the differences in contributions between optimal and non-optimal actions. Experiments across several RL domains, such as GridWorld, FrozenLake, and Taxi, demonstrate the effectiveness of the CSV method. The results show that this method not only improves transparency in complex RL systems but also quantifies the differences across various decisions.","sentences":["This paper introduces a novel approach Counterfactual Shapley Values (CSV), which enhances explainability in reinforcement learning (RL) by integrating counterfactual analysis with Shapley Values.","The approach aims to quantify and compare the contributions of different state dimensions to various action choices.","To more accurately analyze these impacts, we introduce new characteristic value functions, the ``Counterfactual Difference Characteristic Value\" and the ``Average Counterfactual Difference Characteristic Value.\"","These functions help calculate the Shapley values to evaluate the differences in contributions between optimal and non-optimal actions.","Experiments across several RL domains, such as GridWorld, FrozenLake, and Taxi, demonstrate the effectiveness of the CSV method.","The results show that this method not only improves transparency in complex RL systems but also quantifies the differences across various decisions."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02529v2"}
