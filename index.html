                  <p>Current long context large language models (LLMs) can process inputs up to 100,000 tokens, yet struggle to generate outputs exceeding even a modest length of 2,000 words.Through controlled experiments, we find that the model's effective generation length is inherently bounded by the sample it has seen during supervised fine-tuning (SFT).In other words, their output limitation is due to the scarcity of long-output examples in existing SFT datasets.To address this, we introduce AgentWrite, an agent-based pipeline that decomposes ultra-long generation tasks into subtasks, enabling off-the-shelf LLMs to generate coherent outputs exceeding 20,000 words.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Leveraging AgentWrite, we construct LongWriter-6k, a dataset containing 6,000 SFT data with output lengths ranging from 2k to 32k words. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.84</span></span>By incorporating this dataset into model training, we successfully scale the output length of existing models to over 10,000 words while maintaining output quality.We also develop LongBench-Write, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating ultra-long generation capabilities.Our 9B parameter model, further improved through DPO, achieves state-of-the-art performance on this benchmark, surpassing even much larger proprietary models.In general, our work demonstrates that existing long context LLM already possesses the potential for a larger output window--all you need is data with extended output during model alignment to unlock this capability.Our code & models are at: https://github.com/THUDM/LongWriter.</p>

                  <p>Moving object segmentation (MOS) using a 3D light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensor is crucial for scene understanding and identification of moving objects.Despite the availability of various types of 3D LiDAR sensors in the market, MOS research still predominantly focuses on 3D point clouds from mechanically spinning omnidirectional LiDAR sensors.Thus, we are, for example, lacking a dataset with MOS labels for point clouds from solid-state LiDAR sensors which have irregular scanning patterns.In this paper, we present a labeled dataset, called \textit{HeLiMOS}, that enables to test MOS approaches on four heterogeneous LiDAR sensors, including two solid-state LiDAR sensors.Furthermore, we introduce a novel automatic labeling method to substantially reduce the labeling effort required from human annotators.To this end, our framework exploits an instance-aware static map building approach and tracking-based false label filtering.Finally, we provide experimental results regarding the performance of commonly used state-of-the-art MOS approaches on HeLiMOS that suggest a new direction for a sensor-agnostic MOS, which generally works regardless of the type of LiDAR sensors used to capture 3D point clouds.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our dataset is available at https://sites.google.com/view/helimos. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.924</span></span></p>

                  <p>Vision transformers (ViTs) excel in computer vision for modeling long-term dependencies, yet face two key challenges for image quality assessment (IQA): discarding fine details during patch embedding, and requiring extensive training data due to lack of inductive biases.In this study, we propose a Global-Local progressive INTegration network for IQA, called GlintIQA, to address these issues through three key components: 1) Hybrid feature extraction combines ViT-based global feature extractor (VGFE) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs)-based local feature extractor (CLFE) to capture global coarse-grained features and local fine-grained features, respectively.The incorporation of CNNs mitigates the patch-level information loss and inductive bias constraints inherent to ViT architectures.2) Progressive feature integration leverages diverse kernel sizes in embedding to spatially align coarse- and fine-grained features, and progressively aggregate these features by interactively stacking channel-wise attention and spatial enhancement modules to build effective quality-aware representations.3) Content similarity-based labeling approach is proposed that automatically assigns quality labels to images with diverse content based on subjective quality scores.This addresses the scarcity of labeled training data in synthetic datasets and bolsters model generalization.The experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, yielding 5.04% average SROCC gains on cross-authentic dataset evaluations.Moreover, our model and its counterpart pre-trained on the proposed dataset respectively exhibited 5.40% and 13.23% improvements on across-synthetic datasets evaluation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The codes and proposed dataset will be released at https://github.com/XiaoqiWang/GlintIQA. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.778</span></span></p>

                  <p>Standing at the forefront of knowledge dissemination, digital libraries curate vast collections of scientific literature.However, these scholarly writings are often laden with jargon and tailored for domain experts rather than the general public.As librarians, we strive to offer services to a diverse audience, including those with lower reading levels.To extend our services beyond mere access, we propose fine-tuning a language model to rewrite scholarly abstracts into more comprehensible versions, thereby making scholarly literature more accessible when requested.We began by introducing a corpus specifically designed for training models to simplify scholarly abstracts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This corpus consists of over three thousand pairs of abstracts and significance statements from diverse disciplines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.712</span></span>We then fine-tuned four language models using this corpus.The outputs from the models were subsequently examined both quantitatively for accessibility and semantic coherence, and qualitatively for language quality, faithfulness, and completeness.Our findings show that the resulting models can improve readability by over three grade levels, while maintaining fidelity to the original content.Although commercial state-of-the-art models still hold an edge, our models are much more compact, can be deployed locally in an affordable manner, and alleviate the privacy concerns associated with using commercial models.We envision this work as a step toward more inclusive and accessible libraries, improving our services for young readers and those without a college degree.</p>

                  <p>This paper studies zero-shot object recognition using event camera data.Guided by CLIP, which is pre-trained on RGB images, existing approaches achieve zero-shot object recognition by maximizing embedding similarities between event data encoded by an event encoder and RGB images encoded by the CLIP image encoder.Alternatively, several methods learn RGB frame reconstructions from event data for the CLIP image encoder.However, these approaches often result in suboptimal zero-shot performance.   This study develops an event encoder without relying on additional reconstruction networks.We theoretically analyze the performance bottlenecks of previous approaches: global similarity-based objective (i.e., maximizing the embedding similarities) cause semantic misalignments between the learned event embedding space and the CLIP text embedding space due to the degree of freedom.To mitigate the issue, we explore a scalar-wise regularization strategy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, to scale up the number of events and RGB data pairs for training, we also propose a pipeline for synthesizing event data from static RGB images.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.752</span></span>Experimentally, our data synthesis strategy exhibits an attractive scaling property, and our method achieves superior zero-shot object recognition performance on extensive standard benchmark datasets, even compared with past supervised learning approaches.For example, we achieve 47.84% zero-shot accuracy on the N-ImageNet dataset.</p>

                  <p>Task-specific data-fusion networks have marked considerable achievements in urban scene parsing.Among these networks, our recently proposed RoadFormer successfully extracts heterogeneous features from RGB images and surface normal maps and fuses these features through attention mechanisms, demonstrating compelling efficacy in RGB-Normal road scene parsing.However, its performance significantly deteriorates when handling other types/sources of data or performing more universal, all-category scene parsing tasks.To overcome these limitations, this study introduces RoadFormer+, an efficient, robust, and adaptable model capable of effectively fusing RGB-X data, where ``X'', represents additional types/modalities of data such as depth, thermal, surface normal, and polarization.Specifically, we propose a novel hybrid feature decoupling encoder to extract heterogeneous features and decouple them into global and local components.These decoupled features are then fused through a dual-branch multi-scale heterogeneous feature fusion block, which employs parallel Transformer attentions and convolutional neural network modules to merge multi-scale features across different scales and receptive fields.The fused features are subsequently fed into a decoder to generate the final semantic predictions.Notably, our proposed RoadFormer+ ranks first on the KITTI Road benchmark and achieves state-of-the-art performance in mean intersection over union on the Cityscapes, MFNet, FMB, and ZJU datasets.Moreover, it reduces the number of learnable parameters by 65\% compared to RoadFormer.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our source code will be publicly available at mias.group/RoadFormerPlus. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.715</span></span></p>

                  <p>Massive multi-modality datasets play a significant role in facilitating the success of large video-language models.However, current video-language datasets primarily provide text descriptions for visual frames, considering audio to be weakly related information.They usually overlook exploring the potential of inherent audio-visual correlation, leading to monotonous annotation within each modality instead of comprehensive and precise descriptions.Such ignorance results in the difficulty of multiple cross-modality studies.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To fulfill this gap, we present MMTrail, a large-scale multi-modality video-language dataset incorporating more than 20M trailer clips with visual captions, and 2M high-quality clips with multimodal captions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.794</span></span>Trailers preview full-length video works and integrate context, visual frames, and background music.In particular, the trailer has two main advantages: (1) the topics are diverse, and the content characters are of various types, e.g., film, news, and gaming.(2) the corresponding background music is custom-designed, making it more coherent with the visual context.Upon these insights, we propose a systemic captioning framework, achieving various modality annotations with more than 27.1k hours of trailer videos.Here, to ensure the caption retains music perspective while preserving the authority of visual context, we leverage the advanced LLM to merge all annotations adaptively.In this fashion, our MMtrail dataset potentially paves the path for fine-grained large multimodal-language model training.In experiments, we provide evaluation metrics and benchmark results on our dataset, demonstrating the high quality of our annotation and its effectiveness for model training.</p>

                  <p>Infrared small target detection poses unique challenges due to the scarcity of intrinsic target features and the abundance of similar background distractors.We argue that background semantics play a pivotal role in distinguishing visually similar objects for this task.To address this, we introduce a new task -- clustered infrared small target detection, and present DenseSIRST, a novel benchmark dataset that provides per-pixel semantic annotations for background regions, enabling the transition from sparse to dense target detection.Leveraging this dataset, we propose the Background-Aware Feature Exchange Network (BAFE-Net), which transforms the detection paradigm from a single task focused on the foreground to a multi-task architecture that jointly performs target detection and background semantic segmentation.BAFE-Net introduces a cross-task feature hard-exchange mechanism to embed target and background semantics between the two tasks.Furthermore, we propose the Background-Aware Gaussian Copy-Paste (BAG-CP) method, which selectively pastes small targets into sky regions during training, avoiding the creation of false alarm targets in complex non-sky backgrounds.Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of BAG-CP and BAFE-Net in improving target detection accuracy while reducing false alarms.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The DenseSIRST dataset, code, and trained models are available at https://github.com/GrokCV/BAFE-Net. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.704</span></span></p>

We included 115,692 unstructured echocardiogram reports from the UMCU a large university hospital in the Netherlands.A randomly selected subset was manually annotated for the occurrence and severity of eleven commonly described cardiac characteristics.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We developed and tested several automatic labelling techniques at both span and document levels, using weighted and macro F1-score, precision, and recall for performance evaluation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.645</span></span>We compared the performance of span labelling against document labelling methods, which included both direct document classifiers and indirect document classifiers that rely on span classification results.   The SpanCategorizer and MedRoBERTa.nl models outperformed all other span and document classifiers, respectively.The weighted F1-score varied between characteristics, ranging from 0.60 to 0.93 in SpanCategorizer and 0.96 to 0.98 in MedRoBERTa.nl.Direct document classification was superior to indirect document classification using span classifiers.SetFit achieved competitive document classification performance using only 10\% of the training data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Utilizing a reduced label set yielded near-perfect document classification results.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.632</span></span>We recommend using our published SpanCategorizer and MedRoBERTa.nl models for span- and document-level diagnosis extraction from Dutch echocardiography reports.For settings with limited training data, SetFit may be a promising alternative for document classification.</p>

                  <p>Moving object segmentation (MOS) using a 3D light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensor is crucial for scene understanding and identification of moving objects.Despite the availability of various types of 3D LiDAR sensors in the market, MOS research still predominantly focuses on 3D point clouds from mechanically spinning omnidirectional LiDAR sensors.Thus, we are, for example, lacking a dataset with MOS labels for point clouds from solid-state LiDAR sensors which have irregular scanning patterns.In this paper, we present a labeled dataset, called \textit{HeLiMOS}, that enables to test MOS approaches on four heterogeneous LiDAR sensors, including two solid-state LiDAR sensors.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we introduce a novel automatic labeling method to substantially reduce the labeling effort required from human annotators. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.692</span></span>To this end, our framework exploits an instance-aware static map building approach and tracking-based false label filtering.Finally, we provide experimental results regarding the performance of commonly used state-of-the-art MOS approaches on HeLiMOS that suggest a new direction for a sensor-agnostic MOS, which generally works regardless of the type of LiDAR sensors used to capture 3D point clouds.Our dataset is available at https://sites.google.com/view/helimos.</p>

                  <p>In object detection, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain.However, UDA's reliance on labeled source data restricts its adaptability in privacy-related scenarios.This study focuses on source-free object detection (SFOD), which adapts a source-trained detector to an unlabeled target domain without using labeled source data.Recent advancements in self-training, particularly with the Mean Teacher (MT) framework, show promise for SFOD deployment.However, the absence of source supervision significantly compromises the stability of these approaches.We identify two primary issues, (1) uncontrollable degradation of the teacher model due to inopportune updates from the student model, and (2) the student model's tendency to replicate errors from incorrect pseudo labels, leading to it being trapped in a local optimum.Both factors contribute to a detrimental circular dependency, resulting in rapid performance degradation in recent self-training frameworks.To tackle these challenges, we propose the Dynamic Retraining-Updating (DRU) mechanism, which actively manages the student training and teacher updating processes to achieve co-evolutionary training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, we introduce Historical Student Loss to mitigate the influence of incorrect pseudo labels. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.661</span></span>Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in the SFOD setting on multiple domain adaptation benchmarks, comparable to or even surpassing advanced UDA methods.The code will be released at https://github.com/lbktrinh/DRU</p>

                  <p>In many automated planning applications, action costs can be hard to specify.An example is the time needed to travel through a certain road segment, which depends on many factors, such as the current weather conditions.A natural way to address this issue is to learn to predict these parameters based on input features (e.g., weather forecasts) and use the predicted action costs in automated planning afterward.Decision-Focused Learning (DFL) has been successful in learning to predict the parameters of combinatorial optimization problems in a way that optimizes solution quality rather than prediction quality.This approach yields better results than treating prediction and optimization as separate tasks.In this paper, we investigate for the first time the challenges of implementing DFL for automated planning in order to learn to predict the action costs.There are two main challenges to overcome: (1) planning systems are called during gradient descent learning, to solve planning problems with negative action costs, which are not supported in planning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We propose novel methods for gradient computation to avoid this issue. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.609</span></span>(2) DFL requires repeated planner calls during training, which can limit the scalability of the method.We experiment with different methods approximating the optimal plan as well as an easy-to-implement caching mechanism to speed up the learning process.As the first work that addresses DFL for automated planning, we demonstrate that the proposed gradient computation consistently yields significantly better plans than predictions aimed at minimizing prediction error; and that caching can temper the computation requirements.</p>

                  <p>Recently, researchers have extended the concept of matchings to the more general problem of finding $b$-matchings in hypergraphs broadening the scope of potential applications and challenges.The concept of $b$-matchings, where $b$ is a function that assigns positive integers to the vertices of the graph, is a natural extension of matchings in graphs, where each vertex $v$ is allowed to be matched to up to $b(v)$ edges, rather than just one.The weighted $b$-matching problem then seeks to select a subset of the hyperedges that fulfills the constraint and maximizes the weight.   In this work, we engineer novel algorithms for this generalized problem.More precisely, we introduce exact data reductions for the problem as well as a novel greedy initial solution and local search algorithms.These data reductions allow us to significantly shrink the input size.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This is done by either determining if a hyperedge is guaranteed to be in an optimum $b$-matching and thus can be added to our solution or if it can be safely ignored. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.61</span></span>Our iterated local search algorithm provides a framework for finding suitable improvement swaps of edges.

                  <p>Motivated by applications in clustering and synthetic data generation, we consider the problem of releasing a minimum spanning tree (MST) under edge-weight differential privacy constraints where a graph topology $G=(V,E)$ with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges is public, the weight matrix $\vec{W}\in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ is private, and we wish to release an approximate MST under $\rho$-zero-concentrated differential privacy.Weight matrices are considered neighboring if they differ by at most $\Delta_\infty$ in each entry, i.e., we consider an $\ell_\infty$ neighboring relationship.Existing private MST algorithms either add noise to each entry in $\vec{W}$ and estimate the MST by post-processing or add noise to weights in-place during the execution of a specific MST algorithm.Using the post-processing approach with an efficient MST algorithm takes $O(n^2)$ time on dense graphs but results in an additive error on the weight of the MST of magnitude $O(n^2\log n)$.In-place algorithms give asymptotically better utility, but the running time of existing in-place algorithms is $O(n^3)$ for dense graphs.Our main result is a new differentially private MST algorithm that matches the utility of existing in-place methods while running in time $O(m + n^{3/2}\log n)$ for fixed privacy parameter $\rho$. The technical core of our algorithm is an efficient sublinear time simulation of Report-Noisy-Max that works by discretizing all edge weights to a multiple of $\Delta_\infty$ and forming groups of edges with identical weights.Specifically, we present a data structure that allows us to sample a noisy minimum weight edge among at most $O(n^2)$ cut edges in $O(\sqrt{n} \log n)$ time.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental evaluations support our claims that our algorithm significantly improves previous algorithms either in utility or running time. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.736</span></span></p>

                  <p>Model counting is a fundamental problem in automated reasoning with applications in probabilistic inference, network reliability, neural network verification, and more.Although model counting is computationally intractable from a theoretical perspective due to its #P-completeness, the past decade has seen significant progress in developing state-of-the-art model counters to address scalability challenges.   In this work, we conduct a rigorous assessment of the scalability of model counters in the wild.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To this end, we surveyed 11 application domains and collected an aggregate of 2262 benchmarks from these domains. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.619</span></span>We then evaluated six state-of-the-art model counters on these instances to assess scalability and runtime performance.   Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that the performance of model counters varies significantly across different application domains, underscoring the need for careful selection by the end user.Additionally, we investigated the behavior of different counters with respect to two parameters suggested by the model counting community, finding only a weak correlation.Our analysis highlights the challenges and opportunities for portfolio-based approaches in model counting.</p>

                  <p>Phase-only compressed sensing (PO-CS) is concerned with the recovery of structured signals from the phases of complex measurements.Recent results show that structured signals in the standard sphere $\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$ can be exactly recovered from complex Gaussian phases, by recasting PO-CS as linear compressed sensing and then applying existing solvers such as basis pursuit.Known guarantees are either non-uniform or do not tolerate model error.We show that this linearization approach is more powerful than the prior results indicate.First, it achieves uniform instance optimality: Under complex Gaussian matrix with a near-optimal number of rows, this approach uniformly recovers all signals in $\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$ with errors proportional to the model errors of the signals.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, for sparse recovery there exists an efficient estimator $\mathbf{x}^\sharp$ and some universal constant $C$ such that $\|\mathbf{x}^\sharp-\mathbf{x}\|_2\le \frac{C\sigma_s(\mathbf{x})_1}{\sqrt{s}}~(\forall\mathbf{x}\in\mathbb{S}^{n-1})$, where $\sigma_s(\mathbf{x})_1=\min_{\mathbf{u}\in\Sigma^n_s}\|\mathbf{u}-\mathbf{x}\|_1$ is the model error under $\ell_1$-norm. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span>Second, the instance optimality is robust to small dense disturbances and sparse corruptions that arise before or after capturing the phases.As an extension, we also propose to recast sparsely corrupted PO-CS as a linear corrupted sensing problem and show that this achieves perfect reconstruction of the signals.Our results resemble the instance optimal guarantees in linear compressed sensing and, to our knowledge, are the first results of this kind for a non-linear sensing scenario.</p>

                  <p>One of the grand challenges of artificial general intelligence is developing agents capable of conducting scientific research and discovering new knowledge.While frontier models have already been used as aids to human scientists, e.g. for brainstorming ideas, writing code, or prediction tasks, they still conduct only a small part of the scientific process.This paper presents the first comprehensive framework for fully automatic scientific discovery, enabling frontier large language models to perform research independently and communicate their findings.We introduce The AI Scientist, which generates novel research ideas, writes code, executes experiments, visualizes results, describes its findings by writing a full scientific paper, and then runs a simulated review process for evaluation.In principle, this process can be repeated to iteratively develop ideas in an open-ended fashion, acting like the human scientific community.We demonstrate its versatility by applying it to three distinct subfields of machine learning: diffusion modeling, transformer-based language modeling, and learning dynamics.Each idea is implemented and developed into a full paper at a cost of less than $15 per paper.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To evaluate the generated papers, we design and validate an automated reviewer, which we show achieves near-human performance in evaluating paper scores. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span>The AI Scientist can produce papers that exceed the acceptance threshold at a top machine learning conference as judged by our automated reviewer.This approach signifies the beginning of a new era in scientific discovery in machine learning: bringing the transformative benefits of AI agents to the entire research process of AI itself, and taking us closer to a world where endless affordable creativity and innovation can be unleashed on the world's most challenging problems.Our code is open-sourced at https://github.com/SakanaAI/AI-Scientist</p>

                  <p>Most of the sophisticated AI models utilize huge amounts of annotated data and heavy training to achieve high-end performance.However, there are certain challenges that hinder the deployment of AI models "in-the-wild" scenarios, i.e., inefficient use of unlabeled data, lack of incorporation of human expertise, and lack of interpretation of the results.To mitigate these challenges, we propose a novel Explainable Active Learning (XAL) model, XAL-based semantic segmentation model "SegXAL", that can (i) effectively utilize the unlabeled data, (ii) facilitate the "Human-in-the-loop" paradigm, and (iii) augment the model decisions in an interpretable way.In particular, we investigate the application of the SegXAL model for semantic segmentation in driving scene scenarios.The SegXAL model proposes the image regions that require labeling assistance from Oracle by dint of explainable AI (XAI) and uncertainty measures in a weakly-supervised manner.Specifically, we propose a novel Proximity-aware Explainable-AI (PAE) module and Entropy-based Uncertainty (EBU) module to get an Explainable Error Mask, which enables the machine teachers/human experts to provide intuitive reasoning behind the results and to solicit feedback to the AI system via an active learning strategy.Such a mechanism bridges the semantic gap between man and machine through collaborative intelligence, where humans and AI actively enhance each other's complementary strengths.A novel high-confidence sample selection technique based on the DICE similarity coefficient is also presented within the SegXAL framework.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive quantitative and qualitative analyses are carried out in the benchmarking Cityscape dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span>Results show the outperformance of our proposed SegXAL against other state-of-the-art models.</p>

                  <p>Deep reinforcement learning is a powerful approach to complex decision making.However, one issue that limits its practical application is its brittleness, sometimes failing to train in the presence of small changes in the environment.This work is motivated by the empirical observation that directly applying an already trained model to a related task often works remarkably well, also called zero-shot transfer.We take this practical trick one step further to consider how to systematically select good tasks to train, maximizing overall performance across a range of tasks.Given the high cost of training, it is critical to choose a small set of training tasks.The key idea behind our approach is to explicitly model the performance loss (generalization gap) incurred by transferring a trained model.We hence introduce Model-Based Transfer Learning (MBTL) for solving contextual RL problems.In this work, we model the performance loss as a simple linear function of task context similarity.Furthermore, we leverage Bayesian optimization techniques to efficiently model and estimate the unknown training performance of the task space.We theoretically show that the method exhibits regret that is sublinear in the number of training tasks and discuss conditions to further tighten regret bounds.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We experimentally validate our methods using urban traffic and standard control benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.643</span></span>Despite the conceptual simplicity, the experimental results suggest that MBTL can achieve greater performance than strong baselines, including exhaustive training on all tasks, multi-task training, and random selection of training tasks.This work lays the foundations for investigating explicit modeling of generalization, thereby enabling principled yet effective methods for contextual RL.</p>

                  <p>Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) have emerged as powerful tools for solving complex optimization problems characterized by multiple, often conflicting, objectives.While advancements have been made in computational efficiency as well as diversity and convergence of solutions, a critical challenge persists: the internal evolutionary mechanisms are opaque to human users.Drawing upon the successes of explainable AI in explaining complex algorithms and models, we argue that the need to understand the underlying evolutionary operators and population dynamics within MOEAs aligns well with a visual analytics paradigm.This paper introduces ParetoTracker, a visual analytics framework designed to support the comprehension and inspection of population dynamics in the evolutionary processes of MOEAs.Informed by preliminary literature review and expert interviews, the framework establishes a multi-level analysis scheme, which caters to user engagement and exploration ranging from examining overall trends in performance metrics to conducting fine-grained inspections of evolutionary operations.In contrast to conventional practices that require manual plotting of solutions for each generation, ParetoTracker facilitates the examination of temporal trends and dynamics across consecutive generations in an integrated visual interface.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The effectiveness of the framework is demonstrated through case studies and expert interviews focused on widely adopted benchmark optimization problems. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.711</span></span></p>

                  <p>Existing state-of-the-art methods for surgical phase recognition either rely on the extraction of spatial-temporal features at a short-range temporal resolution or adopt the sequential extraction of the spatial and temporal features across the entire temporal resolution.However, these methods have limitations in modeling spatial-temporal dependency and addressing spatial-temporal redundancy: 1) These methods fail to effectively model spatial-temporal dependency, due to the lack of long-range information or joint spatial-temporal modeling.2)These methods utilize dense spatial features across the entire temporal resolution, resulting in significant spatial-temporal redundancy.In this paper, we propose the Surgical Transformer (Surgformer) to address the issues of spatial-temporal modeling and redundancy in an end-to-end manner, which employs divided spatial-temporal attention and takes a limited set of sparse frames as input.Moreover, we propose a novel Hierarchical Temporal Attention (HTA) to capture both global and local information within varied temporal resolutions from a target frame-centric perspective.Distinct from conventional temporal attention that primarily emphasizes dense long-range similarity, HTA not only captures long-term information but also considers local latent consistency among informative frames.HTA then employs pyramid feature aggregation to effectively utilize temporal information across diverse temporal resolutions, thereby enhancing the overall temporal representation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on two challenging benchmark datasets verify that our proposed Surgformer performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.65</span></span>The code is released at https://github.com/isyangshu/Surgformer.</p>

                  <p>Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are suited as cost-effective and adaptable platforms for carrying Wi-Fi Access Points (APs) and cellular Base Stations (BSs).Implementing aerial networks in disaster management scenarios and crowded areas can effectively enhance Quality of Service (QoS).In such environments, maintaining Line-of-Sight (LoS), especially at higher frequencies, is crucial for ensuring reliable communication networks with high capacity, particularly in environments with obstacles.The main contribution of this paper is a traffic- and obstacle-aware UAV positioning algorithm named Reinforcement Learning-based Traffic and Obstacle-aware Positioning Algorithm (RLTOPA), for such environments.RLTOPA determines the optimal position of the UAV by considering the positions of ground users, the coordinates of obstacles, and the traffic demands of users.This positioning aims to maximize QoS in terms of throughput by ensuring optimal LoS between ground users and the UAV.The network performance of the proposed solution, characterized in terms of mean delay and throughput, was evaluated using the ns- 3 simulator.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results show up to 95% improvement in aggregate throughput and 71% in delay without compromising fairness. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.634</span></span></p>

                  <p>The Rust programming language has garnered significant attention due to its robust safety features and memory management capabilities.Despite its guaranteed memory safety, Rust programs still suffer from runtime errors that are unmanageable, i.e., panic errors.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Notably, over half of the bugs in rustc, Rust's own compiler, are attributable to crash stemming from panic errors. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>However, understanding root causes and resolving these panics often requires substantial effort due to the limited information provided, and the stack backtrace could be intricate, often omitting the actual fault locations.Although numerous automated program repair techniques exist, we observe that the prevailing fix patterns do not readily apply to Rust programs due to natural differences in language mechanisms.To tackle the above challenges, this paper introduces a systematic study aimed at fixing Rust panic bugs.We commence by assembling a dataset, namely Panic4R, which includes 102 real panic bugs and their fixes from the top 500 most downloaded open-source crates.By analyzing Rust's implementation, we identify Rust-specific patterns for fixing panic bugs, which can aid in understanding and providing guidance for generating patches.Finally, we design and implement the first automated fixing tool, PanicKiller, for Rust panic bugs, which effectively generates correct patches on the real-world large-scale dataset, and has already assisted in the resolution of 28 panic bugs in open-source projects.Each resolved issue has been validated by the developers and merged into the respective codebases.</p>

To address this limitation, we propose a self-directed LLM-based automated program repair, ThinkRepair, with two main phases: collection phase and fixing phase.The former phase automatically collects various chains of thoughts that constitute pre-fixed knowledge by instructing LLMs with the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompt.The latter phase targets fixing a bug by first selecting examples for few-shot learning and second automatically interacting with LLMs, optionally appending with feedback of testing information.   Evaluations on two widely studied datasets (Defects4J and QuixBugs) by comparing ThinkRepair with 12 SOTA APRs indicate the priority of ThinkRepair in fixing bugs.Notably, ThinkRepair fixes 98 bugs and improves baselines by 27%-344.4% on Defects4J V1.2.On Defects4J V2.0, ThinkRepair fixes 12-65 more bugs than the SOTA APRs.Additionally, ThinkRepair also makes a considerable improvement on QuixBugs (31 for Java and 21 for Python at most).</p>

                  <p>[Context] The adoption of micro-frontends architectures has gained traction as a promising approach to enhance modularity, scalability, and maintainability of web applications.[Goal] The primary aim of this research is to investigate the benefits and limitations of migrating a real-world application to a micro-frontends architecture from the perspective of the developers.[Method] Based on the action research approach, after diagnosis and planning, we applied an intervention of migrating the target web application to a micro-frontends architecture.Thereafter, the migration was evaluated in a workshop involving the remaining developers responsible for maintaining the application.During the workshop, these developers were presented with the migrated architecture, conducted a simple maintenance task, discussed benefits and limitations in a focus group to gather insights, and answered a questionnaire on the acceptance of the technology.[Results] Developers' perceptions gathered during the focus group reinforce the benefits and limitations reported in the literature.Key benefits included enhanced flexibility in technology choices, scalability of development teams, and gradual migration of technologies.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, the increased complexity of the architecture raised concerns among developers, particularly in dependency and environment management, debugging, and integration testing. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span>[Conclusions] While micro-frontends represent a promising technology, unresolved issues still limit their broader applicability.Developers generally perceived the architecture as useful and moderately easy to use but hesitated to adopt it.</p>
