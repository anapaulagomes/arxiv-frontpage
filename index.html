                  <p>Automatic dietary assessment based on food images remains a challenge, requiring precise food detection, segmentation, and classification.Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer new possibilities by integrating visual and textual reasoning.In this study, we evaluate six state-of-the-art VLMs (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Moondream, DeepSeek, and LLaVA), analyzing their capabilities in food recognition at different levels.For the experimental framework, we introduce the FoodNExTDB, a unique food image database that contains 9,263 expert-labeled images across 10 categories (e.g., "protein source"), 62 subcategories (e.g., "poultry"), and 9 cooking styles (e.g., "grilled").<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In total, FoodNExTDB includes 50k nutritional labels generated by seven experts who manually annotated all images in the database. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.729</span></span>Also, we propose a novel evaluation metric, Expert-Weighted Recall (EWR), that accounts for the inter-annotator variability.Results show that closed-source models outperform open-source ones, achieving over 90% EWR in recognizing food products in images containing a single product.Despite their potential, current VLMs face challenges in fine-grained food recognition, particularly in distinguishing subtle differences in cooking styles and visually similar food items, which limits their reliability for automatic dietary assessment.The FoodNExTDB database is publicly available at https://github.com/AI4Food/FoodNExtDB.</p>

                  <p>Self-supervised learning (SSL) has enabled the development of vision foundation models for Earth Observation (EO), demonstrating strong transferability across diverse remote sensing tasks.While prior work has focused on network architectures and training strategies, the role of dataset curation, especially in balancing and diversifying pre-training datasets, remains underexplored.In EO, this challenge is amplified by the redundancy and heavy-tailed distributions common in satellite imagery, which can lead to biased representations and inefficient training.   In this work, we propose a dynamic dataset pruning strategy designed to improve SSL pre-training by maximizing dataset diversity and balance.Our method iteratively refines the training set without requiring a pre-existing feature extractor, making it well-suited for domains where curated datasets are limited or unavailable.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We demonstrate our approach on the Sentinel-1 Wave Mode (WV) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) archive, a challenging dataset dominated by ocean observations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.76</span></span>We train models from scratch on the entire Sentinel-1 WV archive spanning 10 years.Across three downstream tasks, our results show that dynamic pruning improves both computational efficiency and representation quality, leading to stronger transferability.

                  <p>Lane detection is a critical component of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS).Existing lane detection algorithms generally perform well under favorable weather conditions.However, their performance degrades significantly in adverse conditions, such as fog, which increases the risk of traffic accidents.This challenge is compounded by the lack of specialized datasets and methods designed for foggy environments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this, we introduce the FoggyLane dataset, captured in real-world foggy scenarios, and synthesize two additional datasets, FoggyCULane and FoggyTusimple, from existing popular lane detection datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.757</span></span>Furthermore, we propose a robust Fog-Enhanced Network for lane detection, incorporating a Global Feature Fusion Module (GFFM) to capture global relationships in foggy images, a Kernel Feature Fusion Module (KFFM) to model the structural and positional relationships of lane instances, and a Low-level Edge Enhanced Module (LEEM) to address missing edge details in foggy conditions.Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, with F1-scores of 95.04 on FoggyLane, 79.85 on FoggyCULane, and 96.95 on FoggyTusimple.Additionally, with TensorRT acceleration, the method reaches a processing speed of 38.4 FPS on the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin, confirming its real-time capabilities and robustness in foggy environments.</p>

                  <p>While many EDA tasks already involve graph-based data, existing LLMs in EDA primarily either represent graphs as sequential text, or simply ignore graph-structured data that might be beneficial like dataflow graphs of RTL code.Recent studies have found that LLM performance suffers when graphs are represented as sequential text, and using additional graph information significantly boosts performance.To address these challenges, we introduce BRIDGES, a framework designed to incorporate graph modality into LLMs for EDA tasks.BRIDGES integrates an automated data generation workflow, a solution that combines graph modality with LLM, and a comprehensive evaluation suite.First, we establish an LLM-driven workflow to generate RTL and netlist-level data, converting them into dataflow and netlist graphs with function descriptions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This workflow yields a large-scale dataset comprising over 500,000 graph instances and more than 1.5 billion tokens. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.75</span></span>Second, we propose a lightweight cross-modal projector that encodes graph representations into text-compatible prompts, enabling LLMs to effectively utilize graph data without architectural modifications.Experimental results demonstrate 2x to 10x improvements across multiple tasks compared to text-only baselines, including accuracy in design retrieval, type prediction and perplexity in function description, with negligible computational overhead (<1% model weights increase and <30% additional runtime overhead).Even without additional LLM finetuning, our results outperform text-only by a large margin.We plan to release BRIDGES, including the dataset, models, and training flow.</p>

                  <p>In extended reality (XR), generating full-body motion of the users is important to understand their actions, drive their virtual avatars for social interaction, and convey a realistic sense of presence.While prior works focused on spatially sparse and always-on input signals from motion controllers, many XR applications opt for vision-based hand tracking for reduced user friction and better immersion.Compared to controllers, hand tracking signals are less accurate and can even be missing for an extended period of time.To handle such unreliable inputs, we present Rolling Prediction Model (RPM), an online and real-time approach that generates smooth full-body motion from temporally and spatially sparse input signals.Our model generates 1) accurate motion that matches the inputs (i.e., tracking mode) and 2) plausible motion when inputs are missing (i.e., synthesis mode).More importantly, RPM generates seamless transitions from tracking to synthesis, and vice versa.To demonstrate the practical importance of handling noisy and missing inputs, we present GORP, the first dataset of realistic sparse inputs from a commercial virtual reality (VR) headset with paired high quality body motion ground truth.GORP provides >14 hours of VR gameplay data from 28 people using motion controllers (spatially sparse) and hand tracking (spatially and temporally sparse).We benchmark RPM against the state of the art on both synthetic data and GORP to highlight how we can bridge the gap for real-world applications with a realistic dataset and by handling unreliable input signals.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code, pretrained models, and GORP dataset are available in the project webpage. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.735</span></span></p>

                  <p>Imitation learning has emerged as a promising approach towards building generalist robots.However, scaling imitation learning for large robot foundation models remains challenging due to its reliance on high-quality expert demonstrations.Meanwhile, large amounts of video data depicting a wide range of environments and diverse behaviors are readily available.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This data provides a rich source of information about real-world dynamics and agent-environment interactions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.789</span></span>Leveraging this data directly for imitation learning, however, has proven difficult due to the lack of action annotation required for most contemporary methods.In this work, we present Unified World Models (UWM), a framework that allows for leveraging both video and action data for policy learning.Specifically, a UWM integrates an action diffusion process and a video diffusion process within a unified transformer architecture, where independent diffusion timesteps govern each modality.We show that by simply controlling each diffusion timestep, UWM can flexibly represent a policy, a forward dynamics, an inverse dynamics, and a video generator.Through simulated and real-world experiments, we show that: (1) UWM enables effective pretraining on large-scale multitask robot datasets with both dynamics and action predictions, resulting in more generalizable and robust policies than imitation learning, (2) UWM naturally facilitates learning from action-free video data through independent control of modality-specific diffusion timesteps, further improving the performance of finetuned policies.Our results suggest that UWM offers a promising step toward harnessing large, heterogeneous datasets for scalable robot learning, and provides a simple unification between the often disparate paradigms of imitation learning and world modeling.Videos and code are available at https://weirdlabuw.github.io/uwm/.</p>

                  <p>Diffusion models are widely used for image editing tasks.Existing editing methods often design a representation manipulation procedure by curating an edit direction in the text embedding or score space.However, such a procedure faces a key challenge: overestimating the edit strength harms visual consistency while underestimating it fails the editing task.Notably, each source image may require a different editing strength, and it is costly to search for an appropriate strength via trial-and-error.To address this challenge, we propose Concept Lancet (CoLan), a zero-shot plug-and-play framework for principled representation manipulation in diffusion-based image editing.At inference time, we decompose the source input in the latent (text embedding or diffusion score) space as a sparse linear combination of the representations of the collected visual concepts.This allows us to accurately estimate the presence of concepts in each image, which informs the edit.Based on the editing task (replace/add/remove), we perform a customized concept transplant process to impose the corresponding editing direction.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To sufficiently model the concept space, we curate a conceptual representation dataset, CoLan-150K, which contains diverse descriptions and scenarios of visual terms and phrases for the latent dictionary. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.742</span></span>Experiments on multiple diffusion-based image editing baselines show that methods equipped with CoLan achieve state-of-the-art performance in editing effectiveness and consistency preservation.</p>

                  <p>Since the advent of reasoning-based large language models, many have found great success from distilling reasoning capabilities into student models.Such techniques have significantly bridged the gap between reasoning and standard LLMs on coding tasks.Despite this, much of the progress on distilling reasoning models remains locked behind proprietary datasets or lacks details on data curation, filtering and subsequent training.To address this, we construct a superior supervised fine-tuning (SFT) dataset that we use to achieve state-of-the-art coding capability results in models of various sizes.Our distilled models use only SFT to achieve 61.8% on LiveCodeBench and 24.6% on CodeContests, surpassing alternatives trained with reinforcement learning.We then perform analysis on the data sources used to construct our dataset, the impact of code execution filtering, and the importance of instruction/solution diversity.We observe that execution filtering negatively affected benchmark accuracy, leading us to prioritize instruction diversity over solution correctness.Finally, we also analyze the token efficiency and reasoning patterns utilized by these models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We will open-source these datasets and distilled models to the community. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.802</span></span></p>

                  <p>Vision-language pre-training has recently gained popularity as it allows learning rich feature representations using large-scale data sources.This paradigm has quickly made its way into the medical image analysis community.In particular, there is an impressive amount of recent literature developing vision-language models for radiology.However, the available medical datasets with image-text supervision are scarce, and medical concepts are fine-grained, involving expert knowledge that existing vision-language models struggle to encode.In this paper, we propose to take a prudent step back from the literature and revisit supervised, unimodal pre-training, using fine-grained labels instead.We conduct an extensive comparison demonstrating that unimodal pre-training is highly competitive and better suited to integrating heterogeneous data sources.Our results also question the potential of recent vision-language models for open-vocabulary generalization, which have been evaluated using optimistic experimental settings.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we study novel alternatives to better integrate fine-grained labels and noisy text supervision. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.677</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent studies have shown that bugs can be categorized into intrinsic and extrinsic types.Intrinsic bugs can be backtracked to specific changes in the version control system (VCS), while extrinsic bugs originate from external changes to the VCS and lack a direct bug-inducing change.Using only intrinsic bugs to train bug prediction models has been reported as beneficial to improve the performance of such models.However, there is currently no automated approach to identify intrinsic bugs.To bridge this gap, our study employs Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to automatically identify intrinsic bugs.Specifically, we utilize two embedding techniques, seBERT and TF-IDF, applied to the title and description text of bug reports.The resulting embeddings are fed into well-established machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The primary objective of this paper is to assess the performance of various NLP and machine learning techniques in identifying intrinsic bugs using the textual information extracted from bug reports. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span>The results demonstrate that both seBERT and TF-IDF can be effectively utilized for intrinsic bug identification.The highest performance scores were achieved by combining TF-IDF with the Decision Tree algorithm and utilizing the bug titles (yielding an F1 score of 78%).This was closely followed by seBERT, Support Vector Machine, and bug titles (with an F1 score of 77%).In summary, this paper introduces an innovative approach that automates the identification of intrinsic bugs using textual information derived from bug reports.</p>

                  <p>Performance gap across classes remains a persistent challenge in machine learning, often attributed to variations in class hardness.One way to quantify class hardness is through sample complexity - the minimum number of samples required to effectively learn a given class.Sample complexity theory suggests that class hardness is driven by differences in the amount of data required for generalization.That is, harder classes need substantially more samples to achieve generalization.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Therefore, hardness-based resampling is a promising approach to mitigate these performance disparities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span>While resampling has been studied extensively in data-imbalanced settings, its impact on balanced datasets remains unexplored.   This raises the fundamental question whether resampling is effective because it addresses data imbalance or hardness imbalance.We begin addressing this question by introducing class imbalance into balanced datasets and evaluate its effect on performance disparities.We oversample hard classes and undersample easy classes to bring hard classes closer to their sample complexity requirements while maintaining a constant dataset size for fairness.We estimate class-level hardness using the Area Under the Margin (AUM) hardness estimator and leverage it to compute resampling ratios.Using these ratios, we perform hardness-based resampling on the well-known CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets.   Contrary to theoretical expectations, our results show that hardness-based resampling does not meaningfully affect class-wise performance disparities.To explain this discrepancy, we conduct detailed analyses to identify key challenges unique to hardness-based imbalance, distinguishing it from traditional data-based imbalance.Our insights help explain why theoretical sample complexity expectations fail to translate into practical performance gains and we provide guidelines for future research.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in large language models have significantly improved their reasoning abilities, particularly through techniques involving search and backtracking.Backtracking naturally scales test-time compute by enabling sequential, linearized exploration via long chain-of-thought (CoT) generation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, this is not the only strategy for scaling test-time compute: parallel sampling with best-of-n selection provides an alternative that generates diverse solutions simultaneously. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.661</span></span>Despite the growing adoption of sequential search, its advantages over parallel sampling--especially under a fixed compute budget remain poorly understood.In this paper, we systematically compare these two approaches on two challenging reasoning tasks: CountDown and Sudoku.Surprisingly, we find that sequential search underperforms parallel sampling on CountDown but outperforms it on Sudoku, suggesting that backtracking is not universally beneficial.We identify two factors that can cause backtracking to degrade performance: (1) training on fixed search traces can lock models into suboptimal strategies, and (2) explicit CoT supervision can discourage "implicit" (non-verbalized) reasoning.Extending our analysis to reinforcement learning (RL), we show that models with backtracking capabilities benefit significantly from RL fine-tuning, while models without backtracking see limited, mixed gains.Together, these findings challenge the assumption that backtracking universally enhances LLM reasoning, instead revealing a complex interaction between task structure, training data, model scale, and learning paradigm.</p>

We developed malicious software to execute the attacks and conducted experiments to assess their impact, both in simulation using TurtleBot in Gazebo and in real-world deployment with the Unitree Go1 robot.In simulation, the attacks resulted in an average delay of 36\%, with the most significant delays occurring in scenarios where the robot was forced to take substantially longer alternative paths.In real-world experiments, the delays were even more pronounced, with all attacks successfully rerouting the robot and causing measurable disruptions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These results highlight that the algorithm's robustness is not solely an attribute of its design but is significantly influenced by the operational environment. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span>For example, in constrained environments like tunnels, the delays were maximized due to the limited availability of alternative routes.</p>

                  <p>Chronic wounds affect a large population, particularly the elderly and diabetic patients, who often exhibit limited mobility and co-existing health conditions.Automated wound monitoring via mobile image capture can reduce in-person physician visits by enabling remote tracking of wound size.Semantic segmentation is key to this process, yet wound segmentation remains underrepresented in medical imaging research.To address this, we benchmark state-of-the-art deep learning models from general-purpose vision, medical imaging, and top methods from public wound challenges.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For fair comparison, we standardize training, data augmentation, and evaluation, conducting cross-validationto minimize partitioning bias. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span>We also assess real-world deployment aspects, including generalization to an out-of-distribution wound dataset, computational efficiency, and interpretability.Additionally, we propose a reference object-based approach to convert AI-generated masks into clinically relevant wound size estimates, and evaluate this, along with mask quality, for the best models based on physician assessments.Overall, the transformer-based TransNeXt showed the highest levels of generalizability.Despite variations in inference times, all models processed at least one image per second on the CPU, which is deemed adequate for the intended application.Interpretability analysis typically revealed prominent activations in wound regions, emphasizing focus on clinically relevant features.Expert evaluation showed high mask approval for all analyzed models, with VWFormer and ConvNeXtS backbone performing the best.Size retrieval accuracy was similar across models, and predictions closely matched expert annotations.Finally, we demonstrate how our AI-driven wound size estimation framework, WoundAmbit, can be integrated into a custom telehealth system.Our code will be made available on GitHub upon publication.</p>

                  <p>Multimodal 3D object detection based on deep neural networks has indeed made significant progress.However, it still faces challenges due to the misalignment of scale and spatial information between features extracted from 2D images and those derived from 3D point clouds.Existing methods usually aggregate multimodal features at a single stage.However, leveraging multi-stage cross-modal features is crucial for detecting objects of various scales.Therefore, these methods often struggle to integrate features across different scales and modalities effectively, thereby restricting the accuracy of detection.Additionally, the time-consuming Query-Key-Value-based (QKV-based) cross-attention operations often utilized in existing methods aid in reasoning the location and existence of objects by capturing non-local contexts.However, this approach tends to increase computational complexity.To address these challenges, we present SSLFusion, a novel Scale & Space Aligned Latent Fusion Model, consisting of a scale-aligned fusion strategy (SAF), a 3D-to-2D space alignment module (SAM), and a latent cross-modal fusion module (LFM).SAF mitigates scale misalignment between modalities by aggregating features from both images and point clouds across multiple levels.SAM is designed to reduce the inter-modal gap between features from images and point clouds by incorporating 3D coordinate information into 2D image features.Additionally, LFM captures cross-modal non-local contexts in the latent space without utilizing the QKV-based attention operations, thus mitigating computational complexity.Experiments on the KITTI and DENSE datasets demonstrate that our SSLFusion outperforms state-of-the-art methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our approach obtains an absolute gain of 2.15% in 3D AP, compared with the state-of-art method GraphAlign on the moderate level of the KITTI test set. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.641</span></span></p>

                  <p>Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a widely used non-invasive technique for monitoring cardiovascular health and various physiological parameters on consumer and medical devices.While motion artifacts are well-known challenges in dynamic settings, suboptimal skin-sensor contact in sedentary conditions - a critical issue often overlooked in existing literature - can distort PPG signal morphology, leading to the loss or shift of essential waveform features and therefore degrading sensing performance.In this work, we propose CP-PPG, a novel approach that transforms Contact Pressure-distorted PPG signals into ones with the ideal morphology.CP-PPG incorporates a novel data collection approach, a well-crafted signal processing pipeline, and an advanced deep adversarial model trained with a custom PPG-aware loss function.We validated CP-PPG through comprehensive evaluations, including 1) morphology transformation performance on our self-collected dataset, 2) downstream physiological monitoring performance on public datasets, and 3) in-the-wild performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments demonstrate substantial and consistent improvements in signal fidelity (Mean Absolute Error: 0.09, 40% improvement over the original signal) as well as downstream performance across all evaluations in Heart Rate (HR), Heart Rate Variability (HRV), Respiration Rate (RR), and Blood Pressure (BP) estimation (on average, 21% improvement in HR; 41-46% in HRV; 6% in RR; and 4-5% in BP). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span>These findings highlight the critical importance of addressing skin-sensor contact issues for accurate and dependable PPG-based physiological monitoring.Furthermore, CP-PPG can serve as a generic, plug-in API to enhance PPG signal quality.</p>

                  <p>We address the challenge of representation learning from a continuous stream of video as input, in a self-supervised manner.This differs from the standard approaches to video learning where videos are chopped and shuffled during training in order to create a non-redundant batch that satisfies the independently and identically distributed (IID) sample assumption expected by conventional training paradigms.When videos are only available as a continuous stream of input, the IID assumption is evidently broken, leading to poor performance.We demonstrate the drop in performance when moving from shuffled to sequential learning on three tasks: the one-video representation learning method DoRA, standard VideoMAE on multi-video datasets, and the task of future video prediction.To address this drop, we propose a geometric modification to standard optimizers, to decorrelate batches by utilising orthogonal gradients during training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The proposed modification can be applied to any optimizer -- we demonstrate it with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and AdamW. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.617</span></span>Our proposed orthogonal optimizer allows models trained from streaming videos to alleviate the drop in representation learning performance, as evaluated on downstream tasks.On three scenarios (DoRA, VideoMAE, future prediction), we show our orthogonal optimizer outperforms the strong AdamW in all three scenarios.</p>

                  <p>Peer review is central to academic publishing, but the growing volume of submissions is straining the process.This motivates the development of computational approaches to support peer review.While each review is tailored to a specific paper, reviewers often make assessments according to certain aspects such as Novelty, which reflect the values of the research community.This alignment creates opportunities for standardizing the reviewing process, improving quality control, and enabling computational support.While prior work has demonstrated the potential of aspect analysis for peer review assistance, the notion of aspect remains poorly formalized.Existing approaches often derive aspect sets from review forms and guidelines of major NLP venues, yet data-driven methods for aspect identification are largely underexplored.To address this gap, our work takes a bottom-up approach: we propose an operational definition of aspect and develop a data-driven schema for deriving fine-grained aspects from a corpus of peer reviews.We introduce a dataset of peer reviews augmented with aspects and show how it can be used for community-level review analysis.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We further show how the choice of aspects can impact downstream applications, such as LLM-generated review detection. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.695</span></span>Our results lay a foundation for a principled and data-driven investigation of review aspects, and pave the path for new applications of NLP to support peer review.</p>

                To Backtrack or Not to Backtrack: When Sequential Search Limits Model Reasoning

                  <p>Recent advancements in large language models have significantly improved their reasoning abilities, particularly through techniques involving search and backtracking.Backtracking naturally scales test-time compute by enabling sequential, linearized exploration via long chain-of-thought (CoT) generation.However, this is not the only strategy for scaling test-time compute: parallel sampling with best-of-n selection provides an alternative that generates diverse solutions simultaneously.Despite the growing adoption of sequential search, its advantages over parallel sampling--especially under a fixed compute budget remain poorly understood.In this paper, we systematically compare these two approaches on two challenging reasoning tasks: CountDown and Sudoku.Surprisingly, we find that sequential search underperforms parallel sampling on CountDown but outperforms it on Sudoku, suggesting that backtracking is not universally beneficial.We identify two factors that can cause backtracking to degrade performance: (1) training on fixed search traces can lock models into suboptimal strategies, and (2) explicit CoT supervision can discourage "implicit" (non-verbalized) reasoning.Extending our analysis to reinforcement learning (RL), we show that models with backtracking capabilities benefit significantly from RL fine-tuning, while models without backtracking see limited, mixed gains.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Together, these findings challenge the assumption that backtracking universally enhances LLM reasoning, instead revealing a complex interaction between task structure, training data, model scale, and learning paradigm. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.685</span></span></p>

                  <p>Despite great performance on Olympiad-level reasoning problems, frontier large language models can still struggle on high school math when presented with novel problems outside standard benchmarks.Going beyond final accuracy, we propose a deductive consistency metric to analyze chain-of-thought output from language models (LMs).Formally, deductive reasoning involves two subtasks: understanding a set of input premises and inferring the conclusions that follow from them.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The proposed metric studies LMs' performance on these subtasks, with the goal of explaining LMs' reasoning errors on novel problems: how well do LMs understand input premises with increasing context lengths, and how well can they infer conclusions over multiple reasoning hops? <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.612</span></span>Since existing benchmarks may be memorized, we develop a pipeline to evaluate LMs' deductive consistency on novel, perturbed versions of benchmark problems.On novel grade school math problems (GSM-8k), we find that LMs are fairly robust to increasing number of input premises, but suffer significant accuracy decay as the number of reasoning hops is increased.Interestingly, these errors are masked in the original benchmark as all models achieve near 100% accuracy.As we increase the number of solution steps using a synthetic dataset, prediction over multiple hops still remains the major source of error compared to understanding input premises.Other factors, such as shifts in language style or natural propagation of early errors do not explain the trends.Our analysis provides a new view to characterize LM reasoning -- as computations over a window of input premises and reasoning hops -- that can provide unified evaluation across problem domains.</p>

                  <p>Much of the federated learning (FL) literature focuses on settings where local dataset statistics remain the same between training and testing time.Recent advances in domain generalization (DG) aim to use data from source (training) domains to train a model that generalizes well to data from unseen target (testing) domains.In this paper, we are motivated by two major gaps in existing work on FL and DG: (1) the lack of formal mathematical analysis of DG objectives and training processes; and (2) DG research in FL being limited to the conventional star-topology architecture.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Addressing the second gap, we develop $\textit{Decentralized Federated Domain Generalization with Style Sharing}$ ($\texttt{StyleDDG}$), a fully decentralized DG algorithm designed to allow devices in a peer-to-peer network to achieve DG based on sharing style information inferred from their datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span>Additionally, we fill the first gap by providing the first systematic approach to mathematically analyzing style-based DG training optimization.We cast existing centralized DG algorithms within our framework, and employ their formalisms to model $\texttt{StyleDDG}$. Based on this, we obtain analytical conditions under which a sub-linear convergence rate of $\texttt{StyleDDG}$ can be obtained.Through experiments on two popular DG datasets, we demonstrate that $\texttt{StyleDDG}$ can obtain significant improvements in accuracy across target domains with minimal added communication overhead compared to decentralized gradient methods that do not employ style sharing.</p>

                  <p>Nowadays, developers increasingly rely on solutions powered by Large Language Models (LLM) to assist them with their coding tasks.This makes it crucial to align these tools with human values to prevent malicious misuse.In this paper, we propose a comprehensive framework for assessing the potential harmfulness of LLMs within the software engineering domain.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We begin by developing a taxonomy of potentially harmful software engineering scenarios and subsequently, create a dataset of prompts based on this taxonomy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span>To systematically assess the responses, we design and validate an automatic evaluator that classifies the outputs of a variety of LLMs both open-source and closed-source models, as well as general-purpose and code-specific LLMs.Furthermore, we investigate the impact of models size, architecture family, and alignment strategies on their tendency to generate harmful content.The results show significant disparities in the alignment of various LLMs for harmlessness.We find that some models and model families, such as Openhermes, are more harmful than others and that code-specific models do not perform better than their general-purpose counterparts.Notably, some fine-tuned models perform significantly worse than their base-models due to their design choices.On the other side, we find that larger models tend to be more helpful and are less likely to respond with harmful information.These results highlight the importance of targeted alignment strategies tailored to the unique challenges of software engineering tasks and provide a foundation for future work in this critical area.</p>
