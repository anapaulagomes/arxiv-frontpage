                  <p>This paper studies zero-shot object recognition using event camera data.Guided by CLIP, which is pre-trained on RGB images, existing approaches achieve zero-shot object recognition by maximizing embedding similarities between event data encoded by an event encoder and RGB images encoded by the CLIP image encoder.Alternatively, several methods learn RGB frame reconstructions from event data for the CLIP image encoder.However, these approaches often result in suboptimal zero-shot performance.   This study develops an event encoder without relying on additional reconstruction networks.We theoretically analyze the performance bottlenecks of previous approaches: global similarity-based objective (i.e., maximizing the embedding similarities) cause semantic misalignments between the learned event embedding space and the CLIP text embedding space due to the degree of freedom.To mitigate the issue, we explore a scalar-wise regularization strategy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, to scale up the number of events and RGB data pairs for training, we also propose a pipeline for synthesizing event data from static RGB images.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.752</span></span>Experimentally, our data synthesis strategy exhibits an attractive scaling property, and our method achieves superior zero-shot object recognition performance on extensive standard benchmark datasets, even compared with past supervised learning approaches.For example, we achieve 47.84% zero-shot accuracy on the N-ImageNet dataset.</p>

                  <p>Task-specific data-fusion networks have marked considerable achievements in urban scene parsing.Among these networks, our recently proposed RoadFormer successfully extracts heterogeneous features from RGB images and surface normal maps and fuses these features through attention mechanisms, demonstrating compelling efficacy in RGB-Normal road scene parsing.However, its performance significantly deteriorates when handling other types/sources of data or performing more universal, all-category scene parsing tasks.To overcome these limitations, this study introduces RoadFormer+, an efficient, robust, and adaptable model capable of effectively fusing RGB-X data, where ``X'', represents additional types/modalities of data such as depth, thermal, surface normal, and polarization.Specifically, we propose a novel hybrid feature decoupling encoder to extract heterogeneous features and decouple them into global and local components.These decoupled features are then fused through a dual-branch multi-scale heterogeneous feature fusion block, which employs parallel Transformer attentions and convolutional neural network modules to merge multi-scale features across different scales and receptive fields.The fused features are subsequently fed into a decoder to generate the final semantic predictions.Notably, our proposed RoadFormer+ ranks first on the KITTI Road benchmark and achieves state-of-the-art performance in mean intersection over union on the Cityscapes, MFNet, FMB, and ZJU datasets.Moreover, it reduces the number of learnable parameters by 65\% compared to RoadFormer.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our source code will be publicly available at mias.group/RoadFormerPlus. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.715</span></span></p>

                  <p>Small Video Object Detection (SVOD) is a crucial subfield in modern computer vision, essential for early object discovery and detection.However, existing SVOD datasets are scarce and suffer from issues such as insufficiently small objects, limited object categories, and lack of scene diversity, leading to unitary application scenarios for corresponding methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this gap, we develop the XS-VID dataset, which comprises aerial data from various periods and scenes, and annotates eight major object categories. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.867</span></span>To further evaluate existing methods for detecting extremely small objects, XS-VID extensively collects three types of objects with smaller pixel areas: extremely small (\textit{es}, $0\sim12^2$), relatively small (\textit{rs}, $12^2\sim20^2$), and generally small (\textit{gs}, $20^2\sim32^2$).XS-VID offers unprecedented breadth and depth in covering and quantifying minuscule objects, significantly enriching the scene and object diversity in the dataset.Extensive validations on XS-VID and the publicly available VisDrone2019VID dataset show that existing methods struggle with small object detection and significantly underperform compared to general object detectors.Leveraging the strengths of previous methods and addressing their weaknesses, we propose YOLOFT, which enhances local feature associations and integrates temporal motion features, significantly improving the accuracy and stability of SVOD.Our datasets and benchmarks are available at \url{https://gjhhust.github.io/XS-VID/}.</p>

                  <p>Epitope identification is vital for antibody design yet challenging due to the inherent variability in antibodies.While many deep learning methods have been developed for general protein binding site prediction tasks, whether they work for epitope prediction remains an understudied research question.The challenge is also heightened by the lack of a consistent evaluation pipeline with sufficient dataset size and epitope diversity.We introduce a filtered antibody-antigen complex structure dataset, AsEP (Antibody-specific Epitope Prediction).AsEP is the largest of its kind and provides clustered epitope groups, allowing the community to develop and test novel epitope prediction methods.AsEP comes with an easy-to-use interface in Python and pre-built graph representations of each antibody-antigen complex while also supporting customizable embedding methods.Based on this new dataset, we benchmarked various representative general protein-binding site prediction methods and find that their performances are not satisfactory as expected for epitope prediction.We thus propose a new method, WALLE, that leverages both protein language models and graph neural networks.WALLE demonstrate about 5X performance gain over existing methods.Our empirical findings evidence that epitope prediction benefits from combining sequential embeddings provided by language models and geometrical information from graph representations, providing a guideline for future method design.In addition, we reformulate the task as bipartite link prediction, allowing easy model performance attribution and interpretability.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We open-source our data and code at https://github.com/biochunan/AsEP-dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.816</span></span></p>

                  <p>Contrastive Language Image Pre-training (CLIP) has recently demonstrated success across various tasks due to superior feature representation empowered by image-text contrastive learning.However, the instance discrimination method used by CLIP can hardly encode the semantic structure of training data.To handle this limitation, cluster discrimination has been proposed through iterative cluster assignment and classification.Nevertheless, most cluster discrimination approaches only define a single pseudo-label for each image, neglecting multi-label signals in the image.In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-Label Cluster Discrimination method named MLCD to enhance representation learning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In the clustering step, we first cluster the large-scale LAION-400M dataset into one million centers based on off-the-shelf embedding features. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.719</span></span>Considering that natural images frequently contain multiple visual objects or attributes, we select the multiple closest centers as auxiliary class labels.In the discrimination step, we design a novel multi-label classification loss, which elegantly separates losses from positive classes and negative classes, and alleviates ambiguity on decision boundary.We validate the proposed multi-label cluster discrimination method with experiments on different scales of models and pre-training datasets.Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple downstream tasks including linear probe, zero-shot classification, and image-text retrieval.</p>

                  <p>As short-form video-sharing platforms become a significant channel for news consumption, fake news in short videos has emerged as a serious threat in the online information ecosystem, making developing detection methods for this new scenario an urgent need.Compared with that in text and image formats, fake news on short video platforms contains rich but heterogeneous information in various modalities, posing a challenge to effective feature utilization.Unlike existing works mostly focusing on analyzing what is presented, we introduce a novel perspective that considers how it might be created.Through the lens of the creative process behind news video production, our empirical analysis uncovers the unique characteristics of fake news videos in material selection and editing.Based on the obtained insights, we design FakingRecipe, a creative process-aware model for detecting fake news short videos.It captures the fake news preferences in material selection from sentimental and semantic aspects and considers the traits of material editing from spatial and temporal aspects.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To improve evaluation comprehensiveness, we first construct FakeTT, an English dataset for this task, and conduct experiments on both FakeTT and the existing Chinese FakeSV dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.76</span></span>The results show FakingRecipe's superiority in detecting fake news on short video platforms.</p>

                  <p>Facial Recognition Systems (FRSs) are being developed and deployed globally at unprecedented rates.Most platforms are designed in a limited set of countries but deployed in worldwide, without adequate checkpoints.This is especially problematic for Global South countries which lack strong legislation to safeguard persons facing disparate performance of these systems.A combination of unavailability of datasets, lack of understanding of FRS functionality and low-resource bias mitigation measures accentuate the problem.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we propose a new face dataset composed of 6,579 unique male and female sportspersons from eight countries around the world. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.894</span></span>More than 50% of the dataset comprises individuals from the Global South countries and is demographically diverse.To aid adversarial audits and robust model training, each image has four adversarial variants, totaling over 40,000 images.We also benchmark five popular FRSs, both commercial and open-source, for the task of gender prediction (and country prediction for one of the open-source models as an example of red-teaming).Experiments on industrial FRSs reveal accuracies ranging from 98.2%--38.1%, with a large disparity between males and females in the Global South (max difference of 38.5%).Biases are also observed in all FRSs between females of the Global North and South (max difference of ~50%).Grad-CAM analysis identifies the nose, forehead and mouth as the regions of interest on one of the open-source FRSs.Utilizing this insight, we design simple, low-resource bias mitigation solutions using few-shot and novel contrastive learning techniques significantly improving the accuracy with disparity between males and females reducing from 50% to 1.5% in one of the settings.In the red-teaming experiment with the open-source Deepface model, contrastive learning proves more effective than simple fine-tuning.</p>

                  <p>In object detection, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain.However, UDA's reliance on labeled source data restricts its adaptability in privacy-related scenarios.This study focuses on source-free object detection (SFOD), which adapts a source-trained detector to an unlabeled target domain without using labeled source data.Recent advancements in self-training, particularly with the Mean Teacher (MT) framework, show promise for SFOD deployment.However, the absence of source supervision significantly compromises the stability of these approaches.We identify two primary issues, (1) uncontrollable degradation of the teacher model due to inopportune updates from the student model, and (2) the student model's tendency to replicate errors from incorrect pseudo labels, leading to it being trapped in a local optimum.Both factors contribute to a detrimental circular dependency, resulting in rapid performance degradation in recent self-training frameworks.To tackle these challenges, we propose the Dynamic Retraining-Updating (DRU) mechanism, which actively manages the student training and teacher updating processes to achieve co-evolutionary training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, we introduce Historical Student Loss to mitigate the influence of incorrect pseudo labels. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.661</span></span>Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in the SFOD setting on multiple domain adaptation benchmarks, comparable to or even surpassing advanced UDA methods.The code will be released at https://github.com/lbktrinh/DRU</p>

                  <p>Fredman proposed in 1976 the following algorithmic problem: Given are a ground set $X$, some partial order $P$ over $X$, and some comparison oracle $O_L$ that specifies a linear order $L$ over $X$ that extends $P$. A query to $O_L$ has as input distinct $x, x' \in X$ and outputs whether $x <_L x'$ or vice versa.If we denote by $e(P)$ the number of linear extensions of $P$, then $\log e(P)$ is a worst-case lower bound on the number of queries needed to output the sorted order of $X$.   Fredman did not specify in what form the partial order is given.Haeupler, Hlad\'ik, Iacono, Rozhon, Tarjan, and T\v{e}tek ('24) propose to assume as input a directed acyclic graph, $G$, with $m$ edges and $n=|X|$ vertices.Denote by $P_G$ the partial order induced by $G$. Algorithmic performance is measured in running time and the number of queries used, where they use $\Theta(m + n + \log e(P_G))$ time and $\Theta(\log e(P_G))$ queries to output $X$ in its sorted order.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Their algorithm is worst-case optimal in terms of running time and queries, both. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span>Their algorithm combines topological sorting with heapsort, and uses sophisticated data structures (including a recent type of heap with a working-set bound).Their analysis relies upon sophisticated counting arguments using entropy, recursively defined sets defined over the run of their algorithm, and vertices in the graph that they identify as bottlenecks for sorting.   In this paper, we do away with sophistication.We show that when the input is a directed acyclic graph then the problem admits a simple solution using $\Theta(m + n + \log e(P_G))$ time and $\Theta(\log e(P_G))$ queries.Especially our proofs are much simpler as we avoid the usage of advanced charging arguments and data structures, and instead rely upon two brief observations.</p>

                  <p>In recent years, several new lexicase-based selection variants have emerged due to the success of standard lexicase selection in various application domains.For symbolic regression problems, variants that use an epsilon-threshold or batches of training cases, among others, have led to performance improvements.Lately, especially variants that combine lexicase selection and down-sampling strategies have received a lot of attention.This paper evaluates random as well as informed down-sampling in combination with the relevant lexicase-based selection methods on a wide range of symbolic regression problems.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In contrast to most work, we not only compare the methods over a given evaluation budget, but also over a given time as time is usually limited in practice. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.626</span></span>We find that for a given evaluation budget, epsilon-lexicase selection in combination with random or informed down-sampling outperforms all other methods.Only for a rather long running time of 24h, the best performing method is tournament selection in combination with informed down-sampling.If the given running time is very short, lexicase variants using batches of training cases perform best.</p>

                  <p>Neural networks are increasingly evolving towards training large models with big data, a method that has demonstrated superior performance across many tasks.However, this approach introduces an urgent problem: current deep learning models are predominantly serial, meaning that as the number of network layers increases, so do the training and inference times.This is unacceptable if deep learning is to continue advancing.Therefore, this paper proposes a deep learning parallelization strategy based on the Universal Approximation Theorem (UAT).From this foundation, we designed a parallel network called Para-Former to test our theory.Unlike traditional serial models, the inference time of Para-Former does not increase with the number of layers, significantly accelerating the inference speed of multi-layer networks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results validate the effectiveness of this network. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span></p>

                  <p>Continual learning (CL) is a fundamental topic in machine learning, where the goal is to train a model with continuously incoming data and tasks.Due to the memory limit, we cannot store all the historical data, and therefore confront the ``catastrophic forgetting'' problem, i.e., the performance on the previous tasks can substantially decrease because of the missing information in the latter period.Though a number of elegant methods have been proposed, the catastrophic forgetting phenomenon still cannot be well avoided in practice.In this paper, we study the problem from the gradient perspective, where our aim is to develop an effective algorithm to calibrate the gradient in each updating step of the model; namely, our goal is to guide the model to be updated in the right direction under the situation that a large amount of historical data are unavailable.Our idea is partly inspired by the seminal stochastic variance reduction methods (e.g., SVRG and SAGA) for reducing the variance of gradient estimation in stochastic gradient descent algorithms.Another benefit is that our approach can be used as a general tool, which is able to be incorporated with several existing popular CL methods to achieve better performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also conduct a set of experiments on several benchmark datasets to evaluate the performance in practice. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.733</span></span></p>

                  <p>A semi-streaming algorithm in dynamic graph streams processes any $n$-vertex graph by making one or multiple passes over a stream of insertions and deletions to edges of the graph and using $O(n \cdot \mbox{polylog}(n))$ space.Semi-streaming algorithms for dynamic streams were first obtained in the seminal work of Ahn, Guha, and McGregor in 2012, alongside the introduction of the graph sketching technique, which remains the de facto way of designing algorithms in this model and a highly popular technique for designing graph algorithms in general.   We settle the pass complexity of approximating maximum matchings in dynamic streams via semi-streaming algorithms by improving the state-of-the-art in both upper and lower bounds.   We present a randomized sketching based semi-streaming algorithm for $O(1)$-approximation of maximum matching in dynamic streams using $O(\log\log{n})$ passes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The approximation ratio of this algorithm can be improved to $(1+\epsilon)$ for any fixed $\epsilon > 0$ even on weighted graphs using standard techniques. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.629</span></span>This exponentially improves upon several $O(\log{n})$ pass algorithms developed for this problem since the introduction of the dynamic graph streaming model.

                  <p>The Sparse Vector Technique (SVT) is one of the most fundamental tools in differential privacy (DP).It works as a backbone for adaptive data analysis by answering a sequence of queries on a given dataset, and gleaning useful information in a privacy-preserving manner.Unlike the typical private query releases that directly publicize the noisy query results, SVT is less informative -- it keeps the noisy query results to itself and only reveals a binary bit for each query, indicating whether the query result surpasses a predefined threshold.To provide a rigorous DP guarantee for SVT, prior works in the literature adopt a conservative privacy analysis by assuming the direct disclosure of noisy query results as in typical private query releases.This approach, however, hinders SVT from achieving higher query accuracy due to an overestimation of the privacy risks, which further leads to an excessive noise injection using the Laplacian or Gaussian noise for perturbation.Motivated by this, we provide a new privacy analysis for SVT by considering its less informative nature.Our analysis results not only broaden the range of applicable noise types for perturbation in SVT, but also identify the exponential noise as optimal among all evaluated noises (which, however, is usually deemed non-applicable in prior works).The main challenge in applying exponential noise to SVT is mitigating the sub-optimal performance due to the bias introduced by noise distributions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this, we develop a utility-oriented optimal threshold correction method and an appending strategy, which enhances the performance of SVT by increasing the precision and recall, respectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.609</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The effectiveness of our proposed methods is substantiated both theoretically and empirically, demonstrating significant improvements up to $50\%$ across evaluated metrics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.729</span></span></p>

                  <p>Inferring gene regulatory networks (GRNs) from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data is a complex challenge that requires capturing the intricate relationships between genes and their regulatory interactions.In this study, we tackle this challenge by leveraging the single-cell BERT-based pre-trained transformer model (scBERT), trained on extensive unlabeled scRNA-seq data, to augment structured biological knowledge from existing GRNs.We introduce a novel joint graph learning approach that combines the rich contextual representations learned by pre-trained single-cell language models with the structured knowledge encoded in GRNs using graph neural networks (GNNs).By integrating these two modalities, our approach effectively reasons over boththe gene expression level constraints provided by the scRNA-seq data and the structured biological knowledge inherent in GRNs.We evaluate our method on human cell benchmark datasets from the BEELINE study with cell type-specific ground truth networks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results demonstrate superior performance over current state-of-the-art baselines, offering a deeper understanding of cellular regulatory mechanisms. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.642</span></span></p>

                  <p>As learning-to-rank models are increasingly deployed for decision-making in areas with profound life implications, the FairML community has been developing fair learning-to-rank (LTR) models.These models rely on the availability of sensitive demographic features such as race or sex.However, in practice, regulatory obstacles and privacy concerns protect this data from collection and use.As a result, practitioners may either need to promote fairness despite the absence of these features or turn to demographic inference tools to attempt to infer them.Given that these tools are fallible, this paper aims to further understand how errors in demographic inference impact the fairness performance of popular fair LTR strategies.In which cases would it be better to keep such demographic attributes hidden from models versus infer them?We examine a spectrum of fair LTR strategies ranging from fair LTR with and without demographic features hidden versus inferred to fairness-unaware LTR followed by fair re-ranking.We conduct a controlled empirical investigation modeling different levels of inference errors by systematically perturbing the inferred sensitive attribute.We also perform three case studies with real-world datasets and popular open-source inference methods.Our findings reveal that as inference noise grows, LTR-based methods that incorporate fairness considerations into the learning process may increase bias.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In contrast, fair re-ranking strategies are more robust to inference errors. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>All source code, data, and experimental artifacts of our experimental study are available here: https://github.com/sewen007/hoiltr.git</p>

                  <p>This paper investigates multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL), which focuses on learning Pareto optimal policies in the presence of multiple reward functions.Despite MORL's significant empirical success, there is still a lack of satisfactory understanding of various MORL optimization targets and efficient learning algorithms.Our work offers a systematic analysis of several optimization targets to assess their abilities to find all Pareto optimal policies and controllability over learned policies by the preferences for different objectives.We then identify Tchebycheff scalarization as a favorable scalarization method for MORL.Considering the non-smoothness of Tchebycheff scalarization, we reformulate its minimization problem into a new min-max-max optimization problem.Then, for the stochastic policy class, we propose efficient algorithms using this reformulation to learn Pareto optimal policies.We first propose an online UCB-based algorithm to achieve an $\varepsilon$ learning error with an $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\varepsilon^{-2})$ sample complexity for a single given preference.To further reduce the cost of environment exploration under different preferences, we propose a preference-free framework that first explores the environment without pre-defined preferences and then generates solutions for any number of preferences.We prove that it only requires an $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\varepsilon^{-2})$ exploration complexity in the exploration phase and demands no additional exploration afterward.Lastly, we analyze the smooth Tchebycheff scalarization, an extension of Tchebycheff scalarization, which is proved to be more advantageous in distinguishing the Pareto optimal policies from other weakly Pareto optimal policies based on entry values of preference vectors.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we extend our algorithms and theoretical analysis to accommodate this optimization target. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.644</span></span></p>

To address this limitation, we propose a self-directed LLM-based automated program repair, ThinkRepair, with two main phases: collection phase and fixing phase.The former phase automatically collects various chains of thoughts that constitute pre-fixed knowledge by instructing LLMs with the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompt.The latter phase targets fixing a bug by first selecting examples for few-shot learning and second automatically interacting with LLMs, optionally appending with feedback of testing information.   Evaluations on two widely studied datasets (Defects4J and QuixBugs) by comparing ThinkRepair with 12 SOTA APRs indicate the priority of ThinkRepair in fixing bugs.Notably, ThinkRepair fixes 98 bugs and improves baselines by 27%-344.4% on Defects4J V1.2.On Defects4J V2.0, ThinkRepair fixes 12-65 more bugs than the SOTA APRs.Additionally, ThinkRepair also makes a considerable improvement on QuixBugs (31 for Java and 21 for Python at most).</p>

                  <p><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Video-based bug reports are increasingly being used to document bugs for programs centered around a graphical user interface (GUI). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.629</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, developing automated techniques to manage video-based reports is challenging as it requires identifying and understanding often nuanced visual patterns that capture key information about a reported bug. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span>In this paper, we aim to overcome these challenges by advancing the bug report management task of duplicate detection for video-based reports.To this end, we introduce a new approach, called JANUS, that adapts the scene-learning capabilities of vision transformers to capture subtle visual and textual patterns that manifest on app UI screens - which is key to differentiating between similar screens for accurate duplicate report detection.JANUS also makes use of a video alignment technique capable of adaptive weighting of video frames to account for typical bug manifestation patterns.In a comprehensive evaluation on a benchmark containing 7,290 duplicate detection tasks derived from 270 video-based bug reports from 90 Android app bugs, the best configuration of our approach achieves an overall mRR/mAP of 89.8%/84.7%, and for the large majority of duplicate detection tasks, outperforms prior work by around 9% to a statistically significant degree.Finally, we qualitatively illustrate how the scene-learning capabilities provided by Janus benefits its performance.</p>
