                  <p>Despite rapid advancements in TTS models, a consistent and robust human evaluation framework is still lacking.For example, MOS tests fail to differentiate between similar models, and CMOS's pairwise comparisons are time-intensive.The MUSHRA test is a promising alternative for evaluating multiple TTS systems simultaneously, but in this work we show that its reliance on matching human reference speech unduly penalises the scores of modern TTS systems that can exceed human speech quality.More specifically, we conduct a comprehensive assessment of the MUSHRA test, focusing on its sensitivity to factors such as rater variability, listener fatigue, and reference bias.Based on our extensive evaluation involving 471 human listeners across Hindi and Tamil we identify two primary shortcomings: (i) reference-matching bias, where raters are unduly influenced by the human reference, and (ii) judgement ambiguity, arising from a lack of clear fine-grained guidelines.To address these issues, we propose two refined variants of the MUSHRA test.The first variant enables fairer ratings for synthesized samples that surpass human reference quality.The second variant reduces ambiguity, as indicated by the relatively lower variance across raters.By combining these approaches, we achieve both more reliable and more fine-grained assessments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also release MANGO, a massive dataset of 47,100 human ratings, the first-of-its-kind collection for Indian languages, aiding in analyzing human preferences and developing automatic metrics for evaluating TTS systems. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.76</span></span></p>

In this paper, we propose an approach employing Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) to curate datasets of publicly-available software vulnerability patches.Our methodology leverages machine learning models that incorporate UQ to differentiate between patches based on their potential utility.We begin by evaluating a number of popular UQ techniques, including Vanilla, Monte Carlo Dropout, and Model Ensemble, as well as homoscedastic and heteroscedastic models of noise.Our findings indicate that Model Ensemble and heteroscedastic models are the best choices for vulnerability patch datasets.Based on these UQ modeling choices, we propose a heuristic that uses UQ to filter out lower quality instances and select instances with high utility value from the vulnerability dataset.Using our approach, we observe an improvement in predictive performance and significant reduction of model training time (i.e., energy consumption) for a state-of-the-art vulnerability prediction model.</p>

                  <p>Accurate and fast recognition of forgeries is an issue of great importance in the fields of artificial intelligence, image processing and object detection.Recognition of forgeries of facial imagery is the process of classifying and defining the faces in it by analyzing real-world facial images.This process is usually accomplished by extracting features from an image, using classifier algorithms, and correctly interpreting the results.Recognizing forgeries of facial imagery correctly can encounter many different challenges.For example, factors such as changing lighting conditions, viewing faces from different angles can affect recognition performance, and background complexity and perspective changes in facial images can make accurate recognition difficult.Despite these difficulties, significant progress has been made in the field of forgery detection.Deep learning algorithms, especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have significantly improved forgery detection performance.   This study focuses on image processing-based forgery detection using Fake-Vs-Real-Faces (Hard)[10] and 140k Real and Fake Faces<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>[61] data sets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.928</span></span>Both data sets consist of two classes containing real and fake facial images.In our study, two lightweight deep learning models are proposed to conduct forgery detection using these images.Additionally, 8 different pretrained CNN architectures were tested on both data sets and the results were compared with newly developed lightweight CNN models.It's shown that the proposed lightweight deep learning models have minimum number of layers.It's also shown that the proposed lightweight deep learning models detect forgeries of facial imagery accurately, and computationally efficiently.Although the data set consists only of face images, the developed models can also be used in other two-class object recognition problems.</p>

                  <p>Planning with partial observation is a central challenge in embodied AI.A majority of prior works have tackled this challenge by developing agents that physically explore their environment to update their beliefs about the world state.In contrast, humans can $\textit{imagine}$ unseen parts of the world through a mental exploration and $\textit{revise}$ their beliefs with imagined observations.Such updated beliefs can allow them to make more informed decisions, without necessitating the physical exploration of the world at all times.To achieve this human-like ability, we introduce the $\textit{Generative World Explorer (Genex)}$, an egocentric world exploration framework that allows an agent to mentally explore a large-scale 3D world (e.g., urban scenes) and acquire imagined observations to update its belief.This updated belief will then help the agent to make a more informed decision at the current step.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To train $\textit{Genex}$, we create a synthetic urban scene dataset, Genex-DB. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.716</span></span>Our experimental results demonstrate that (1) $\textit{Genex}$ can generate high-quality and consistent observations during long-horizon exploration of a large virtual physical world and (2) the beliefs updated with the generated observations can inform an existing decision-making model (e.g., an LLM agent) to make better plans.</p>

                  <p>Text-to-image diffusion model is a popular paradigm that synthesizes personalized images by providing a text prompt and a random Gaussian noise.While people observe that some noises are ``golden noises'' that can achieve better text-image alignment and higher human preference than others, we still lack a machine learning framework to obtain those golden noises.To learn golden noises for diffusion sampling, we mainly make three contributions in this paper.First, we identify a new concept termed the \textit{noise prompt}, which aims at turning a random Gaussian noise into a golden noise by adding a small desirable perturbation derived from the text prompt.Following the concept, we first formulate the \textit{noise prompt learning} framework that systematically learns ``prompted'' golden noise associated with a text prompt for diffusion models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Second, we design a noise prompt data collection pipeline and collect a large-scale \textit{noise prompt dataset}~(NPD) that contains 100k pairs of random noises and golden noises with the associated text prompts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.838</span></span>With the prepared NPD as the training dataset, we trained a small \textit{noise prompt network}~(NPNet) that can directly learn to transform a random noise into a golden noise.The learned golden noise perturbation can be considered as a kind of prompt for noise, as it is rich in semantic information and tailored to the given text prompt.Third, our extensive experiments demonstrate the impressive effectiveness and generalization of NPNet on improving the quality of synthesized images across various diffusion models, including SDXL, DreamShaper-xl-v2-turbo, and Hunyuan-DiT.Moreover, NPNet is a small and efficient controller that acts as a plug-and-play module with very limited additional inference and computational costs, as it just provides a golden noise instead of a random noise without accessing the original pipeline.</p>

                  <p>Consider the following stochastic matching problem.Given a graph $G=(V, E)$, an unknown subgraph $G_p = (V, E_p)$ is realized where $E_p$ includes every edge of $E$ independently with some probability $p \in (0, 1]$. The goal is to query a sparse subgraph $H$ of $G$, such that the realized edges in $H$ include an approximate maximum matching of $G_p$.   This problem has been studied extensively over the last decade due to its numerous applications in kidney exchange, online dating, and online labor markets.For any fixed $\epsilon > 0$, [BDH STOC'20] showed that any graph $G$ has a subgraph $H$ with $\text{quasipoly}(1/p) = (1/p)^{\text{poly}(\log(1/p))}$ maximum degree, achieving a $(1-\epsilon)$-approximation.A major open question is the best approximation achievable with $\text{poly}(1/p)$-degree subgraphs.A long line of work has progressively improved the approximation in the $\text{poly}(1/p)$-degree regime from .5[BDH+ EC'15] to .501[AKL EC'17], .656<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>[BHFR SODA'19], .666 <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.78</span></span>[AB SOSA'19], .731[BBD SODA'22] (bipartite graphs), and most recently to .68[DS '24].In this work, we show that a $\text{poly}(1/p)$-degree subgraph can obtain a $(1-\epsilon)$-approximation for any desirably small fixed $\epsilon > 0$, achieving the best of both worlds.   Beyond its quantitative improvement, a key conceptual contribution of our work is to connect local computation algorithms (LCAs) to the stochastic matching problem for the first time.While prior work on LCAs mainly focuses on their out-queries (the number of vertices probed to produce the output of a given vertex), our analysis also bounds the in-queries (the number of vertices that probe a given vertex).We prove that the outputs of LCAs with bounded in- and out-queries (in-n-out LCAs for short) have limited correlation, a property that our analysis crucially relies on and might find applications beyond stochastic matchings.</p>

                  <p>Significant advances have been made in natural language processing in recent years.However, our current deep learning approach to language modeling requires substantial resources in terms of data and computation.One of the side effects of this data-hungry paradigm is the current schism between languages, separating those considered high-resource, where most of the development happens and resources are available, and the low-resource ones, which struggle to attain the same level of performance and autonomy.This study aims to introduce a new set of resources to stimulate the future development of neural text generation in Portuguese.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we document the development of GigaVerbo, a concatenation of deduplicated Portuguese text corpora amounting to 200 billion tokens. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.726</span></span>Via this corpus, we trained a series of decoder-transformers named Tucano.Our models perform equal or superior to other Portuguese and multilingual language models of similar size in several Portuguese benchmarks.The evaluation of our models also reveals that model performance on many currently available benchmarks used by the Portuguese NLP community has little to no correlation with the scaling of token ingestion during training, highlighting the limitations of such evaluations when it comes to the assessment of Portuguese generative language models.All derivatives of our study are openly released on GitHub and Hugging Face.See https://nkluge-correa.github.io/Tucano/</p>

                  <p>When unsure about an answer, humans often respond with more words than necessary, hoping that part of the response will be correct.We observe a similar behavior in large language models (LLMs), which we term "Verbosity Compensation" (VC).VC is harmful because it confuses the user understanding, leading to low efficiency, and influences the LLM services by increasing the latency and cost of generating useless tokens.In this paper, we present the first work that defines and analyzes Verbosity Compensation, explores its causes, and proposes a simple mitigating approach.We define Verbosity Compensation as the behavior of generating responses that can be compressed without information loss when prompted to write concisely.Our experiments, conducted on five datasets of knowledge and reasoning-based QA tasks with 14 newly developed LLMs, reveal three conclusions.1) We reveal a pervasive presence of verbosity compensation across all models and all datasets.Notably, GPT-4 exhibits a VC frequency of 50.40%.2)We reveal the large performance gap between verbose and concise responses, with a notable difference of 27.61% on the Qasper dataset.We also demonstrate that this difference does not naturally diminish as LLM capability increases.Both 1) and 2) highlight the urgent need to mitigate the frequency of VC behavior and disentangle verbosity with veracity.We propose a simple yet effective cascade algorithm that replaces the verbose responses with the other model-generated responses.The results show that our approach effectively alleviates the VC of the Mistral model from 63.81% to 16.16% on the Qasper dataset.3) We also find that verbose responses exhibit higher uncertainty across all five datasets, suggesting a strong connection between verbosity and model uncertainty.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our dataset and code are available at https://github.com/psunlpgroup/VerbosityLLM. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.837</span></span></p>

                  <p>With the recent exhibited strength of generative diffusion models, an open research question is \textit{if images generated by these models can be used to learn better visual representations}.While this generative data expansion may suffice for easier visual tasks, we explore its efficacy on a more difficult discriminative task: clothes-changing person re-identification (CC-ReID).CC-ReID aims to match people appearing in non-overlapping cameras, even when they change their clothes across cameras.Not only are current CC-ReID models constrained by the limited diversity of clothing in current CC-ReID datasets, but generating additional data that retains important personal features for accurate identification is a current challenge.To address this issue we propose DLCR, a novel data expansion framework that leverages pre-trained diffusion and large language models (LLMs) to accurately generate diverse images of individuals in varied attire.We generate additional data for five benchmark CC-ReID datasets (PRCC, CCVID, LaST, VC-Clothes, and LTCC) and \textbf{increase their clothing diversity by \boldmath{$10$}x, totaling over \boldmath{$2.1$}M images generated}.DLCR employs diffusion-based text-guided inpainting, conditioned on clothing prompts constructed using LLMs, to generate synthetic data that only modifies a subject's clothes while preserving their personally identifiable features.With this massive increase in data, we introduce two novel strategies - progressive learning and test-time prediction refinement - that respectively reduce training time and further boosts CC-ReID performance.On the PRCC dataset, we obtain a large top-1 accuracy improvement of $11.3\%$ by training CAL, a previous state of the art (SOTA) method, with DLCR-generated data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We publicly release our code and generated data for each dataset here: \url{https://github.com/CroitoruAlin/dlcr}. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.907</span></span></p>

                  <p>Supporting the health and well-being of dynamic populations around the world requires governmental agencies, organizations and researchers to understand and reason over complex relationships between human behavior and local contexts in order to identify high-risk groups and strategically allocate limited resources.Traditional approaches to these classes of problems often entail developing manually curated, task-specific features and models to represent human behavior and the natural and built environment, which can be challenging to adapt to new, or even, related tasks.To address this, we introduce a Population Dynamics Foundation Model (PDFM) that aims to capture the relationships between diverse data modalities and is applicable to a broad range of geospatial tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We first construct a geo-indexed dataset for postal codes and counties across the United States, capturing rich aggregated information on human behavior from maps, busyness, and aggregated search trends, and environmental factors such as weather and air quality. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.804</span></span>We then model this data and the complex relationships between locations using a graph neural network, producing embeddings that can be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks using relatively simple models.We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach by benchmarking it on 27 downstream tasks spanning three distinct domains: health indicators, socioeconomic factors, and environmental measurements.The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on all 27 geospatial interpolation tasks, and on 25 out of the 27 extrapolation and super-resolution tasks.We combined the PDFM with a state-of-the-art forecasting foundation model, TimesFM, to predict unemployment and poverty, achieving performance that surpasses fully supervised forecasting.The full set of embeddings and sample code are publicly available for researchers.</p>

To fill in the blank, we present the first systematic investigation of MLLMs in generating interactive webpages.Specifically, we first formulate the Interaction-to-Code task and build the Interaction2Code benchmark that contains 97 unique web pages and 213 distinct interactions, spanning 15 webpage types and 30 interaction categories.We then conduct comprehensive experiments on three state-of-the-art (SOTA) MLLMs using both automatic metrics and human evaluations, thereby summarizing six findings accordingly.Our experimental results highlight the limitations of MLLMs in generating fine-grained interactive features and managing interactions with complex transformations and subtle visual modifications.We further analyze failure cases and their underlying causes, identifying 10 common failure types and assessing their severity.Additionally, our findings reveal three critical influencing factors, i.e., prompts, visual saliency, and textual descriptions, that can enhance the interaction generation performance of MLLMs.Based on these findings, we elicit implications for researchers and developers, providing a foundation for future advancements in this field.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Datasets and source code are available at https://github.com/WebPAI/Interaction2Code. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.87</span></span></p>

                  <p>In real-world NLP applications, Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising solutions due to their extensive training on vast datasets.However, the large size and high computation demands of LLMs limit their practicality in many applications, especially when further fine-tuning is required.To address these limitations, smaller models are typically preferred for deployment.However, their training is hindered by the scarcity of labeled data.In contrast, unlabeled data is often readily which can be leveraged by using LLMs to generate pseudo-labels for training smaller models.This enables the smaller models (student) to acquire knowledge from LLMs(teacher) while reducing computational costs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This process introduces challenges, such as potential noisy pseudo-labels. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.612</span></span>Selecting high-quality and informative data is therefore critical to enhance model performance while improving the efficiency of data utilization.To address this, we propose LLKD that enables Learning with Less computational resources and less data for Knowledge Distillation from LLMs.LLKD is an adaptive sample selection method that incorporates signals from both the teacher and student.Specifically, it prioritizes samples where the teacher demonstrates high confidence in its labeling, indicating reliable labels, and where the student exhibits a high information need, identifying challenging samples that require further learning.Our comprehensive experiments show that LLKD achieves superior performance across various datasets with higher data efficiency.</p>

                  <p>Characterizing the computational power of neural network architectures in terms of formal language theory remains a crucial line of research, as it describes lower and upper bounds on the reasoning capabilities of modern AI.However, when empirically testing these bounds, existing work often leaves a discrepancy between experiments and the formal claims they are meant to support.The problem is that formal language theory pertains specifically to recognizers: machines that receive a string as input and classify whether it belongs to a language.On the other hand, it is common to instead use proxy tasks that are similar in only an informal sense, such as language modeling or sequence-to-sequence transduction.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We correct this mismatch by training and evaluating neural networks directly as binary classifiers of strings, using a general method that can be applied to a wide variety of languages. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span>As part of this, we extend an algorithm recently proposed by Sn{\ae}bjarnarson et al.

                  <p>Thermomechanical stress induced by through-silicon vias (TSVs) plays an important role in the performance and reliability analysis of 2.5D/3D ICs.While the finite element method (FEM) adopted by commercial software can provide accurate simulation results, it is very time- and memory-consuming for large-scale analysis.Over the past decade, the linear superposition method has been utilized to perform fast thermal stress estimations of TSV arrays, but it suffers from a lack of accuracy.In this paper, we propose MORE-Stress, a novel strict numerical algorithm for efficient thermal stress simulation of TSV arrays based on model order reduction.Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm can realize a 153-504 times reduction in computational time and a 39-115 times reduction in memory usage compared with the commercial software ANSYS, with negligible errors less than 1%.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our algorithm is as efficient as the linear superposition method, with an order of magnitude smaller errors and fast convergence. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.673</span></span></p>

                  <p>The effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in solving tasks vastly depends on the quality of the instructions, which often require fine-tuning through extensive human effort.This highlights the need for automated instruction optimization; however, this optimization is particularly challenging when dealing with black-box LLMs, where model parameters and gradients remain inaccessible.We propose ACING, a task-specific prompt optimization approach framed as a stateless continuous-action Reinforcement Learning (RL) problem, known as the continuum bandit setting.ACING leverages an actor-critic-based method to optimize prompts, learning from non-differentiable reward signals.We validate ACING by optimizing prompts for ChatGPT on 30 instruction-based tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>ACING consistently outperforms baseline methods, achieving a median score improvement of 10 percentage points. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.667</span></span>Furthermore, ACING not only recovers but also surpasses human-crafted expert instructions, achieving up to a 39 percentage point improvement against human benchmarks.</p>

                  <p>Many software engineering maintenance tasks require linking a commit that induced a bug with the commit that later fixed that bug.Several existing SZZ algorithms provide a way to identify the potential commit that induced a bug when given a fixing commit as input.Prior work introduced the notion of a "work item", a logical grouping of commits that could be a single unit of work.Our key insight in this work is to recognize that a bug-inducing commit and the fix(es) for that bug together represent a "work item."It is not currently understood how these work items, which are logical groups of revisions addressing a single issue or feature, could impact the performance of algorithms such as SZZ.In this paper, we propose a heuristic that, given an input commit, uses information about changed methods to identify related commits that form a work item with the input commit.We hypothesize that given such a work item identifying heuristic, we can identify bug-inducing commits more accurately than existing SZZ approaches.We then build a new variant of SZZ that we call Work Item Aware SZZ (WIA-SZZ), that leverages our work item detecting heuristic to first suggest bug-inducing commits.If our heuristic fails to find any candidates, we then fall back to baseline variants of SZZ.We conduct a manual evaluation to assess the accuracy of our heuristic to identify work items.Our evaluation reveals the heuristic is 64% accurate in finding work items, but most importantly it is able to find many bug-inducing commits.We then evaluate our approach on 821 repositories that have been previously used to study the performance of SZZ, comparing our work against six SZZ variants.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>That evaluation shows an improvement in F1 scores ranging from 2% to 9%, or when looking only at the subset of cases that found work item improved 3% to 14%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.653</span></span></p>

                  <p>In recent years, the rapid growth of security vulnerabilities poses great challenges to tracing and managing them.For example, it was reported that the NVD database experienced significant delays due to the shortage of maintainers.Such delay creates challenges for third-party security personnel (e.g., administrators) to trace the information related to the CVE.To help security personnel trace a vulnerability patch, we build a retrieval system that automatically retrieves the patch in the repository.   Inspired by existing work on explainable machine learning, we ask the following research question: can explanations help security maintainers make decisions in patch tracing?First, we investigate using LIME (a widely used explainable machine learning method) to highlight the rationale tokens in the commit message and code.In addition, we propose an explanation method called TfIdf-Highlight, which leverages the Tf-Idf statistics to select the most informative words in the repository and the dataset.We evaluate the effectiveness of highlighting using two experiments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>First, we compare LIME and TfIdf-Highlight using a faithfulness score (i.e., sufficiency and comprehensiveness) defined for ranking. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.619</span></span>We find that TfIdf-Highlight significantly outperforms LIME's sufficiency scores by 15\% and slightly outperforms the comprehensiveness scores.Second, we conduct a blind human labeling experiment by asking the annotators to guess the patch under 3 settings (TfIdf-Highlight, LIME, and no highlight).We find that the helpfulness score for TfIdf-Highlight is higher than LIME while the labeling accuracies of LIME and TfIdf-Highlight are similar.Nevertheless, highlighting does not improve the accuracy over non-highlighting.</p>

                  <p>Rerankers, typically cross-encoders, are often used to re-score the documents retrieved by cheaper initial IR systems.This is because, though expensive, rerankers are assumed to be more effective.We challenge this assumption by measuring reranker performance for full retrieval, not just re-scoring first-stage retrieval.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experiments reveal a surprising trend: the best existing rerankers provide diminishing returns when scoring progressively more documents and actually degrade quality beyond a certain limit. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span>In fact, in this setting, rerankers can frequently assign high scores to documents with no lexical or semantic overlap with the query.We hope that our findings will spur future research to improve reranking.</p>

                  <p>While general-purpose computing follows Von Neumann's architecture, the data movement between memory and processor elements dictates the processor's performance.The evolving compute-in-memory (CiM) paradigm tackles this issue by facilitating simultaneous processing and storage within static random-access memory (SRAM) elements.Numerous design decisions taken at different levels of hierarchy affect the figure of merits (FoMs) of SRAM, such as power, performance, area, and yield.The absence of a rapid assessment mechanism for the impact of changes at different hierarchy levels on global FoMs poses a challenge to accurately evaluating innovative SRAM designs.This paper presents an automation tool designed to optimize the energy and latency of SRAM designs incorporating diverse implementation strategies for executing logic operations within the SRAM.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The tool structure allows easy comparison across different array topologies and various design strategies to result in energy-efficient implementations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.632</span></span>Our study involves a comprehensive comparison of over 6900+ distinct design implementation strategies for EPFL combinational benchmark circuits on the energy-recycling resonant compute-in-memory (rCiM) architecture designed using TSMC 28 nm technology.When provided with a combinational circuit, the tool aims to generate an energy-efficient implementation strategy tailored to the specified input memory and latency constraints.The tool reduces 80.9% of energy consumption on average across all benchmarks while using the six-topology implementation compared to baseline implementation of single-macro topology by considering the parallel processing capability of rCiM cache size ranging from 4KB to 192KB.</p>

                  <p>By augmenting Large Language Models (LLMs) with external tools, their capacity to solve complex problems has been significantly enhanced.However, despite ongoing advancements in the parsing capabilities of LLMs, incorporating all available tools simultaneously in the prompt remains impractical due to the vast number of external tools.Consequently, it is essential to provide LLMs with a precise set of tools tailored to the specific task, considering both quantity and quality.Current tool retrieval methods primarily focus on refining the ranking list of tools and directly packaging a fixed number of top-ranked tools as the tool set.However, these approaches often fail to equip LLMs with the optimal set of tools prior to execution, since the optimal number of tools for different tasks could be different, resulting in inefficiencies such as redundant or unsuitable tools, which impede immediate access to the most relevant tools.This paper addresses the challenge of recommending precise toolsets for LLMs.We introduce the problem of tool recommendation, define its scope, and propose a novel Precision-driven Tool Recommendation (PTR) approach.PTR captures an initial, concise set of tools by leveraging historical tool bundle usage and dynamically adjusts the tool set by performing tool matching, culminating in a multi-view-based tool addition.Additionally, we present a new dataset, RecTools, and a metric, TRACC, designed to evaluate the effectiveness of tool recommendation for LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We further validate our design choices through comprehensive experiments, demonstrating promising accuracy across two open benchmarks and our RecTools dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.639</span></span></p>

                  <p>Emerging Large Language Model (LLM) applications require long input prompts to perform complex downstream tasks like document analysis and code generation.For these long context length applications, the length of the input prompt poses a significant challenge in terms of inference efficiency since the inference costs increase linearly with sequence length.However, for many of these applications, much of the context in the prompt is fixed across different user inputs, thereby providing the opportunity to perform offline optimizations to process user inputs quickly, as they are received.In this work, we propose Squeezed Attention as a mechanism to accelerate LLM applications where a large portion of the input prompt is fixed.We first leverage K-means clustering offline to group the keys for the fixed context based on semantic similarity and represent each cluster with a single centroid value.During inference, we compare query tokens from the user input with the centroids to predict which of the keys from the fixed context are semantically relevant and need to be loaded during inference.We then compute exact attention using only these important keys from the fixed context, thereby reducing bandwidth and computational costs.We also extend our method to use a hierarchical centroid lookup to identify important keys, which can reduce the complexity of attention from linear to logarithmic with respect to the context length.We implement optimized Triton kernels for centroid comparison and sparse FlashAttention with important keys, achieving more than 4x speedups during both the prefill and generation phases for long-context inference.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we have extensively evaluated our method on various long-context benchmarks including LongBench, where it achieves a 3x reduction in KV cache budget without accuracy loss and up to an 8x reduction with <0.5 point accuracy gap for various models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.667</span></span></p>

                  <p>Machine learning models are often trained on sensitive data (e.g., medical records and race/gender) that is distributed across different "silos" (e.g., hospitals).These federated learning models may then be used to make consequential decisions, such as allocating healthcare resources.Two key challenges emerge in this setting: (i) maintaining the privacy of each person's data, even if other silos or an adversary with access to the central server tries to infer this data; (ii) ensuring that decisions are fair to different demographic groups (e.g., race/gender).In this paper, we develop a novel algorithm for private and fair federated learning (FL).Our algorithm satisfies inter-silo record-level differential privacy (ISRL-DP), a strong notion of private FL requiring that siloi's sent messages satisfy record-level differential privacy for all i.Our framework can be used to promote different fairness notions, including demographic parity and equalized odds.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We prove that our algorithm converges under mild smoothness assumptions on the loss function, whereas prior work required strong convexity for convergence. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.648</span></span>As a byproduct of our analysis, we obtain the first convergence guarantee for ISRL-DP nonconvex-strongly concave min-max FL.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art fairness-accuracy tradeoffs of our algorithm across different privacy levels. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.622</span></span></p>

                  <p>The field of AI-assisted music creation has made significant strides, yet existing systems often struggle to meet the demands of iterative and nuanced music production.These challenges include providing sufficient control over the generated content and allowing for flexible, precise edits.This thesis tackles these issues by introducing a series of advancements that progressively build upon each other, enhancing the controllability and editability of text-to-music generation models.   First, we introduce Loop Copilot, a system that tries to address the need for iterative refinement in music creation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Loop Copilot leverages a large language model (LLM) to coordinate multiple specialised AI models, enabling users to generate and refine music interactively through a conversational interface. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>Central to this system is the Global Attribute Table, which records and maintains key musical attributes throughout the iterative process, ensuring that modifications at any stage preserve the overall coherence of the music.While Loop Copilot excels in orchestrating the music creation process, it does not directly address the need for detailed edits to the generated content.   To overcome this limitation, MusicMagus is presented as a further solution for editing AI-generated music.MusicMagus introduces a zero-shot text-to-music editing approach that allows for the modification of specific musical attributes, such as genre, mood, and instrumentation, without the need for retraining.By manipulating the latent space within pre-trained diffusion models, MusicMagus ensures that these edits are stylistically coherent and that non-targeted attributes remain unchanged.This system is particularly effective in maintaining the structural integrity of the music during edits, but it encounters challenges with more complex and real-world audio scenarios.   ...</p>

                  <p>Many software engineering maintenance tasks require linking a commit that induced a bug with the commit that later fixed that bug.Several existing SZZ algorithms provide a way to identify the potential commit that induced a bug when given a fixing commit as input.Prior work introduced the notion of a "work item", a logical grouping of commits that could be a single unit of work.Our key insight in this work is to recognize that a bug-inducing commit and the fix(es) for that bug together represent a "work item."<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It is not currently understood how these work items, which are logical groups of revisions addressing a single issue or feature, could impact the performance of algorithms such as SZZ. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span>In this paper, we propose a heuristic that, given an input commit, uses information about changed methods to identify related commits that form a work item with the input commit.We hypothesize that given such a work item identifying heuristic, we can identify bug-inducing commits more accurately than existing SZZ approaches.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We then build a new variant of SZZ that we call Work Item Aware SZZ (WIA-SZZ), that leverages our work item detecting heuristic to first suggest bug-inducing commits. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.641</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>If our heuristic fails to find any candidates, we then fall back to baseline variants of SZZ. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>We conduct a manual evaluation to assess the accuracy of our heuristic to identify work items.Our evaluation reveals the heuristic is 64% accurate in finding work items, but most importantly it is able to find many bug-inducing commits.We then evaluate our approach on 821 repositories that have been previously used to study the performance of SZZ, comparing our work against six SZZ variants.That evaluation shows an improvement in F1 scores ranging from 2% to 9%, or when looking only at the subset of cases that found work item improved 3% to 14%.</p>

                  <p>The typical selective state-space model (SSM) of Mamba addresses several limitations of Transformers, such as quadratic computational complexity with sequence length and significant inference-time memory requirements due to the key-value cache.However, the growing size of Mamba models continues to pose training and deployment challenges and raises environmental concerns due to considerable energy consumption.In this work, we introduce Bi-Mamba, a scalable and powerful 1-bit Mamba architecture designed for more efficient large language models with multiple sizes across 780M, 1.3B, and 2.7B. Bi-Mamba models are trained from scratch on data volume as regular LLM pertaining using an autoregressive distillation loss.Extensive experimental results on language modeling demonstrate that Bi-Mamba achieves performance comparable to its full-precision counterparts (e.g., FP16 or BF16) and much better accuracy than post-training-binarization (PTB) Mamba baselines, while significantly reducing memory footprint and energy consumption compared to the original Mamba model.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our study pioneers a new linear computational complexity LLM framework under low-bit representation and facilitates the future design of specialized hardware tailored for efficient 1-bit Mamba-based LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.691</span></span></p>
