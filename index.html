                  <p>Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models are accelerating the development of Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents that utilize human-like vision perception capabilities to enhance productivity on digital devices.Compared to approaches predicated on GUI metadata, which are platform-dependent and vulnerable to implementation variations, vision-based approaches offer broader applicability.In this vision-based paradigm, the GUI instruction grounding, which maps user instruction to the location of corresponding element on the given screenshot, remains a critical challenge, particularly due to limited public training dataset and resource-intensive manual instruction data annotation.In this paper, we delve into unexplored challenges in this task including element-to-screen ratio, unbalanced element type, and implicit instruction.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address these challenges, we introduce a large-scale data synthesis pipeline UI-E2I-Synth for generating varying complex instruction datasets using GPT-4o instead of human annotators. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.754</span></span>Furthermore, we propose a new GUI instruction grounding benchmark UI-I2E-Bench, which is designed to address the limitations of existing benchmarks by incorporating diverse annotation aspects.Our model, trained on the synthesized data, achieves superior performance in GUI instruction grounding, demonstrating the advancements of proposed data synthesis pipeline.The proposed benchmark, accompanied by extensive analyses, provides practical insights for future research in GUI grounding.We will release corresponding artifacts at https://colmon46.github.io/i2e-bench-leaderboard/</p>

                  <p>Multimodal Foundation Models (MFMs) excel at representing diverse raw modalities (e.g., text, images, audio, videos, etc.).As recommender systems increasingly incorporate these modalities, leveraging MFMs to generate better representations has great potential.However, their application in sequential recommendation remains largely unexplored.This is primarily because mainstream adaptation methods, such as Fine-Tuning and even Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques (e.g., Adapter and LoRA), incur high computational costs, especially when integrating multiple modality encoders, thus hindering research progress.As a result, it remains unclear whether we can efficiently and effectively adapt multiple (>2) MFMs for the sequential recommendation task.   To address this, we propose a plug-and-play Cross-modal Side Adapter Network (CROSSAN).Leveraging the fully decoupled side adapter-based paradigm, CROSSAN achieves high efficiency while enabling cross-modal learning across diverse modalities.To optimize the final stage of multimodal fusion across diverse modalities, we adopt the Mixture of Modality Expert Fusion (MOMEF) mechanism.CROSSAN achieves superior performance on the public datasets for adapting four foundation models with raw modalities.Performance consistently improves as more MFMs are adapted.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We will release our code and datasets to facilitate future research. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.836</span></span></p>

                  <p>An AI system can create and maintain knowledge only to the extent that it can verify that knowledge itself.Recent work on long Chain-of-Thought reasoning has demonstrated great potential of LLMs on solving competitive problems, but their verification ability remains to be weak and not sufficiently investigated.In this paper, we propose Heimdall, the long CoT verification LLM that can accurately judge the correctness of solutions.With pure reinforcement learning, we boost the verification accuracy from 62.5% to 94.5% on competitive math problems.By scaling with repeated sampling, the accuracy further increases to 97.5%.Through human evaluation, Heimdall demonstrates impressive generalization capabilities, successfully detecting most issues in challenging math proofs, the type of which is not included during training.Furthermore, we propose Pessimistic Verification to extend the functionality of Heimdall to scaling up the problem solving.It calls Heimdall to judge the solutions from a solver model and based on the pessimistic principle, selects the most likely correct solution with the least uncertainty.Taking DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B as the solver model, Pessimistic Verification improves the solution accuracy on AIME2025 from 54.2% to 70.0% with 16x compute budget and to 83.3% with more compute budget.With the stronger solver Gemini 2.5 Pro, the score reaches 93.0%.Finally, we prototype an automatic knowledge discovery system, a ternary system where one poses questions, another provides solutions, and the third verifies the solutions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Using the data synthesis work NuminaMath for the first two components, Heimdall effectively identifies problematic records within the dataset and reveals that nearly half of the data is flawed, which interestingly aligns with the recent ablation studies from NuminaMath. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.713</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent advances in video generation have posed great challenges in the assessment of AI-generated content, particularly with the emergence of increasingly sophisticated models.The various inconsistencies and defects observed in such videos are inherently complex, making overall scoring notoriously difficult.In this paper, we emphasize the critical importance of integrating fine-grained reasoning into video evaluation, and we propose $\textbf{F}$ing$\textbf{ER}$, a novel entity-level reasoning evaluation framework that first automatically generates $\textbf{F}$ine-grained $\textbf{E}$ntity-level questions, and then answers those questions by a $\textbf{R}$easoning model with scores, which can be subsequently weighted summed to an overall score for different applications.Specifically, we leverage LLMs to derive entity-level questions across five distinct perspectives, which (i) often focus on some specific entities of the content, thereby making answering or scoring much easier by MLLMs, and (ii) are more interpretable.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Then we construct a FingER dataset, consisting of approximately 3.3k videos and corresponding 60k fine-grained QA annotations, each with detailed reasons. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.87</span></span>Based on that, we further investigate various training protocols to best incentivize the reasoning capability of MLLMs for correct answer prediction.Extensive experiments demonstrate that a reasoning model trained using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a cold-start strategy achieves the best performance.Notably, our model surpasses existing methods by a relative margin of $11.8\%$ on GenAI-Bench and $5.5\%$ on MonetBench with only 3.3k training videos, which is at most one-tenth of the training samples utilized by other methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and dataset will be released soon. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.959</span></span></p>

By leveraging structural and semantic features with pre- trained 2D image generation models and a VLM-based realism evaluation, Art3D successfully enhances the three-dimensional illusion in reference images, thus simplifying the process of generating 3D from 2D, and proves adaptable to a wide range of painting styles.To benchmark the generalization performance of existing image-to-3D models on flat-colored images without 3D feeling, we collect a new dataset, Flat-2D, with over 100 samples.Experimental results demonstrate the performance and robustness of Art3D, exhibiting superior generalizable capacity and promising practical applicability.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our source code and dataset will be publicly available on our project page: https://joy-jy11.github.io/ . <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.905</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent progress in diffusion models significantly advances various image generation tasks.However, the current mainstream approach remains focused on building task-specific models, which have limited efficiency when supporting a wide range of different needs.While universal models attempt to address this limitation, they face critical challenges, including generalizable task instruction, appropriate task distributions, and unified architectural design.To tackle these challenges, we propose VisualCloze, a universal image generation framework, which supports a wide range of in-domain tasks, generalization to unseen ones, unseen unification of multiple tasks, and reverse generation.Unlike existing methods that rely on language-based task instruction, leading to task ambiguity and weak generalization, we integrate visual in-context learning, allowing models to identify tasks from visual demonstrations.Meanwhile, the inherent sparsity of visual task distributions hampers the learning of transferable knowledge across tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To this end, we introduce Graph200K, a graph-structured dataset that establishes various interrelated tasks, enhancing task density and transferable knowledge. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.804</span></span>Furthermore, we uncover that our unified image generation formulation shared a consistent objective with image infilling, enabling us to leverage the strong generative priors of pre-trained infilling models without modifying the architectures.</p>

                  <p>Camera trajectory design plays a crucial role in video production, serving as a fundamental tool for conveying directorial intent and enhancing visual storytelling.In cinematography, Directors of Photography meticulously craft camera movements to achieve expressive and intentional framing.However, existing methods for camera trajectory generation remain limited: Traditional approaches rely on geometric optimization or handcrafted procedural systems, while recent learning-based methods often inherit structural biases or lack textual alignment, constraining creative synthesis.In this work, we introduce an auto-regressive model inspired by the expertise of Directors of Photography to generate artistic and expressive camera trajectories.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We first introduce DataDoP, a large-scale multi-modal dataset containing 29K real-world shots with free-moving camera trajectories, depth maps, and detailed captions in specific movements, interaction with the scene, and directorial intent. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.858</span></span>Thanks to the comprehensive and diverse database, we further train an auto-regressive, decoder-only Transformer for high-quality, context-aware camera movement generation based on text guidance and RGBD inputs, named GenDoP. Extensive experiments demonstrate that compared to existing methods, GenDoP offers better controllability, finer-grained trajectory adjustments, and higher motion stability.We believe our approach establishes a new standard for learning-based cinematography, paving the way for future advancements in camera control and filmmaking.Our project website: https://kszpxxzmc.github.io/GenDoP/.</p>

                  <p>Diffusion models are widely used for image editing tasks.Existing editing methods often design a representation manipulation procedure by curating an edit direction in the text embedding or score space.However, such a procedure faces a key challenge: overestimating the edit strength harms visual consistency while underestimating it fails the editing task.Notably, each source image may require a different editing strength, and it is costly to search for an appropriate strength via trial-and-error.To address this challenge, we propose Concept Lancet (CoLan), a zero-shot plug-and-play framework for principled representation manipulation in diffusion-based image editing.At inference time, we decompose the source input in the latent (text embedding or diffusion score) space as a sparse linear combination of the representations of the collected visual concepts.This allows us to accurately estimate the presence of concepts in each image, which informs the edit.Based on the editing task (replace/add/remove), we perform a customized concept transplant process to impose the corresponding editing direction.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To sufficiently model the concept space, we curate a conceptual representation dataset, CoLan-150K, which contains diverse descriptions and scenarios of visual terms and phrases for the latent dictionary. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.742</span></span>Experiments on multiple diffusion-based image editing baselines show that methods equipped with CoLan achieve state-of-the-art performance in editing effectiveness and consistency preservation.</p>

                  <p>With the release of the o1 model by OpenAI, reasoning models adopting slow thinking strategies have gradually emerged.As the responses generated by such models often include complex reasoning, intermediate steps, and self-reflection, existing evaluation methods are often inadequate.They struggle to determine whether the LLM output is truly equivalent to the reference answer, and also have difficulty identifying and extracting the final answer from long, complex responses.To address this issue, we propose xVerify, an efficient answer verifier for reasoning model evaluations.xVerify demonstrates strong capability in equivalence judgment, enabling it to effectively determine whether the answers produced by reasoning models are equivalent to reference answers across various types of objective questions.To train and evaluate xVerify, we construct the VAR dataset by collecting question-answer pairs generated by multiple LLMs across various datasets, leveraging multiple reasoning models and challenging evaluation sets designed specifically for reasoning model assessment.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A multi-round annotation process is employed to ensure label accuracy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.716</span></span>Based on the VAR dataset, we train multiple xVerify models of different scales.In evaluation experiments conducted on both the test set and generalization set, all xVerify models achieve overall F1 scores and accuracy exceeding 95\%.Notably, the smallest variant, xVerify-0.5B-I, outperforms all evaluation methods except GPT-4o, while xVerify-3B-Ib surpasses GPT-4o in overall performance.These results validate the effectiveness and generalizability of xVerify.</p>

                  <p>Micro-Action Recognition (MAR) aims to classify subtle human actions in video.However, annotating MAR datasets is particularly challenging due to the subtlety of actions.To this end, we introduce the setting of Semi-Supervised MAR (SSMAR), where only a part of samples are labeled.We first evaluate traditional Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods to SSMAR and find that these methods tend to overfit on inaccurate pseudo-labels, leading to error accumulation and degraded performance.This issue primarily arises from the common practice of directly using the predictions of classifier as pseudo-labels to train the model.To solve this issue, we propose a novel framework, called Asynchronous Pseudo Labeling and Training (APLT), which explicitly separates the pseudo-labeling process from model training.Specifically, we introduce a semi-supervised clustering method during the offline pseudo-labeling phase to generate more accurate pseudo-labels.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, a self-adaptive thresholding strategy is proposed to dynamically filter noisy labels of different classes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.657</span></span>We then build a memory-based prototype classifier based on the filtered pseudo-labels, which is fixed and used to guide the subsequent model training phase.By alternating the two pseudo-labeling and model training phases in an asynchronous manner, the model can not only be learned with more accurate pseudo-labels but also avoid the overfitting issue.Experiments on three MAR datasets show that our APLT largely outperforms state-of-the-art SSL methods.For instance, APLT improves accuracy by 14.5\% over FixMatch on the MA-12 dataset when using only 50\% labeled data.Code will be publicly available.</p>

                  <p>MATLAB/Simulink is the leading tool for simulating complex Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs).The simulation models of complex CPSs are typically compute intensive, and the execution of test cases is long.Furthermore, the execution of test cases is typically triggered several times at different ``in-the-Loop'' test levels (i.e., Model, Software and Hardware-in-the-Loop).Therefore, test optimization techniques, such as test case prioritization, are paramount when testing these systems.In this paper, we present the largest empirical study on test case prioritization techniques for Simulink models by comparing the performance of white-box and black-box test case prioritization techniques.We assess traditional test case prioritization techniques, and we also propose new approaches for use in the context of Simulink models.We empirically compared 11 test case prioritization techniques using six Simulink models of different sizes and complexities.When comparing white-box against black-box test case prioritization techniques, we found that in general, white-box techniques were slightly better than black-box ones.In the context of white-box test case prioritization, the total greedy approach performed better than the additional greedy techniques in larger models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>As for the test case prioritization time, black-box techniques were faster, although total greedy techniques were fast enough to be used in practice. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.6</span></span></p>

                  <p>Microarchitectural attacks are a significant concern, leading to many hardware-based defense proposals.However, different defenses target different classes of attacks, and their impact on each other has not been fully considered.To raise awareness of this problem, we study an interaction between two state-of-the art defenses in this paper, timing obfuscations of remote cache lines (TORC) and delaying speculative changes to remote cache lines (DSRC).TORC mitigates cache-hit based attacks and DSRC mitigates speculative coherence state change attacks.   We observe that DSRC enables coherence information to be retrieved into the processor core, where it is out of the reach of timing obfuscations to protect.This creates an unforeseen consequence that redo operations can be triggered within the core to detect the presence or absence of remote cache lines, which constitutes a security vulnerability.We demonstrate that a new covert channel attack is possible using this vulnerability.We propose two ways to mitigate the attack, whose performance varies depending on an application's cache usage.One way is to never send remote exclusive coherence state (E) information to the core even if it is created.The other way is to never create a remote E state, which is responsible for triggering redos.   We demonstrate the timing difference caused by this microarchitectural defense assumption violation using GEM5 simulations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Performance evaluation on SPECrate 2017 and PARSEC benchmarks of the two fixes show less than 32\% average overhead across both sets of benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.712</span></span>The repair which prevented the creation of remote E state had less than 2.8% average overhead.</p>

                  <p>Autonomous fabrication systems are transforming construction and manufacturing, yet they remain vulnerable to print errors.Texture classification is a key component of computer vision systems that enable real-time monitoring and adjustment during cementitious fabrication.Traditional classification methods often rely on global image features, which can bias the model toward semantic content rather than low-level textures.In this paper, we introduce a novel preprocessing technique called "patch and shuffle," which segments input images into smaller patches, shuffles them, and reconstructs a jumbled image before classification.This transformation removes semantic context, forcing the classifier to rely on local texture features.   We evaluate this approach on a dataset of extruded cement images, using a ResNet-18-based architecture.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experiments compare the patch and shuffle method to a standard pipeline, holding all other factors constant. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.623</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Results show a significant improvement in accuracy: the patch and shuffle model achieved 90.64% test accuracy versus 72.46% for the baseline. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.713</span></span>These findings suggest that disrupting global structure enhances performance in texture-based classification tasks.   This method has implications for broader vision tasks where low-level features matter more than high-level semantics.The technique may improve classification in applications ranging from fabrication monitoring to medical imaging.</p>

                  <p>Language models (LMs) are increasingly being integrated into a wide range of applications, yet the modern evaluation paradigm does not sufficiently reflect how they are actually being used.Current evaluations rely on benchmarks that often lack direct applicability to the real-world contexts in which LMs are being deployed.To address this gap, we propose Dimensional and Contextual Evaluation (DICE), an approach that evaluates LMs on granular, context-dependent dimensions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this position paper, we begin by examining the insufficiency of existing LM benchmarks, highlighting their limited applicability to real-world use cases. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span>Next, we propose a set of granular evaluation parameters that capture dimensions of LM behavior that are more meaningful to stakeholders across a variety of application domains.Specifically, we introduce the concept of context-agnostic parameters - such as robustness, coherence, and epistemic honesty - and context-specific parameters that must be tailored to the specific contextual constraints and demands of stakeholders choosing to deploy LMs into a particular setting.We then discuss potential approaches to operationalize this evaluation framework, finishing with the opportunities and challenges DICE presents to the LM evaluation landscape.Ultimately, this work serves as a practical and approachable starting point for context-specific and stakeholder-relevant evaluation of LMs.</p>

Given unique ranks, it is straightforward to select a designated leader.Thus, our protocol is a self-stabilizing leader election protocol as well.Ranking requires at least $n$ states per agent; hence, the goal is to minimize the additional number of states, called overhead states.The core of our protocol is a space-efficient but non-self-stabilizing ranking protocol that requires only $n + O(\log n)$ states.Our protocol stabilizes in $O(n^2\log n)$ interactions w.h.p.\ and in expectation, using $n + O(\log^2 n)$ states in total.Our stabilization time is asymptotically optimal (see Burman et al., PODC'21).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In comparison to the currently best known ranking protocol by Burman et al., which requires $n + \Omega(n)$ states, our result exponentially improves the number of overhead states. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span></p>

                  <p>Micro-Action Recognition (MAR) aims to classify subtle human actions in video.However, annotating MAR datasets is particularly challenging due to the subtlety of actions.To this end, we introduce the setting of Semi-Supervised MAR (SSMAR), where only a part of samples are labeled.We first evaluate traditional Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods to SSMAR and find that these methods tend to overfit on inaccurate pseudo-labels, leading to error accumulation and degraded performance.This issue primarily arises from the common practice of directly using the predictions of classifier as pseudo-labels to train the model.To solve this issue, we propose a novel framework, called Asynchronous Pseudo Labeling and Training (APLT), which explicitly separates the pseudo-labeling process from model training.Specifically, we introduce a semi-supervised clustering method during the offline pseudo-labeling phase to generate more accurate pseudo-labels.Moreover, a self-adaptive thresholding strategy is proposed to dynamically filter noisy labels of different classes.We then build a memory-based prototype classifier based on the filtered pseudo-labels, which is fixed and used to guide the subsequent model training phase.By alternating the two pseudo-labeling and model training phases in an asynchronous manner, the model can not only be learned with more accurate pseudo-labels but also avoid the overfitting issue.Experiments on three MAR datasets show that our APLT largely outperforms state-of-the-art SSL methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For instance, APLT improves accuracy by 14.5\% over FixMatch on the MA-12 dataset when using only 50\% labeled data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span>Code will be publicly available.</p>

                  <p>LLMs have demonstrated remarkable performance across diverse applications, yet they inadvertently absorb spurious correlations from training data, leading to stereotype associations between biased concepts and specific social groups.These associations perpetuate and even amplify harmful social biases, raising significant fairness concerns.To mitigate such biases, prior studies have attempted to project model embeddings into unbiased spaces during inference.However, these approaches have shown limited effectiveness due to their weak alignment with downstream social biases.Inspired by the observation that concept cognition in LLMs is primarily represented through a linear associative memory mechanism, where key-value mapping occurs in the MLP layers, we posited that biased concepts and social groups are similarly encoded as entity (key) and information (value) pairs, which can be manipulated to promote fairer associations.To this end, we propose Fairness Mediator (FairMed), a bias mitigation framework that neutralizes stereotype associations.Our framework comprises two main components: a stereotype association prober and an adversarial debiasing neutralizer.The prober captures stereotype associations encoded within MLP layer activations by employing prompts centered around biased concepts to detect the emission probabilities for social groups.Subsequently, the adversarial debiasing neutralizer intervenes in MLP activations during inference to equalize the association probabilities among different social groups.Extensive experiments across nine protected attributes show that FairMed significantly outperforms SOTA methods in effectiveness.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Compared to the most effective baseline, FairMed presents competitive efficiency by cutting mitigation overhead by hundreds of minutes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.646</span></span>FairMed also maintains the LLM's language understanding capabilities without compromising overall performance.</p>

                  <p>Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a promising paradigm for scaling large language models (LLMs) with sparse activation of task-specific experts.Despite their computational efficiency during inference, the massive overall parameter footprint of MoE models (e.g., GPT-4) introduces critical challenges for practical deployment.Current pruning approaches often fail to address two inherent characteristics of MoE systems: 1).intra-layer expert homogeneity where experts within the same MoE layer exhibit functional redundancy, and 2).inter-layer similarity patterns where deeper layers tend to contain progressively more homogeneous experts.To tackle these issues, we propose Cluster-driven Expert Pruning (C-Prune), a novel two-stage framework for adaptive task-specific compression of MoE LLMs.C-Prune operates through layer-wise expert clustering, which groups functionally similar experts within each MoE layer using parameter similarity metrics, followed by global cluster pruning, which eliminates redundant clusters across all layers through a unified importance scoring mechanism that accounts for cross-layer homogeneity.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We validate C-Prune through extensive experiments on multiple MoE models and benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.608</span></span>The results demonstrate that C-Prune effectively reduces model size while outperforming existing MoE pruning methods.</p>

                  <p>Recent advances in inference-time compute have significantly improved performance on complex tasks by generating long chains of thought (CoTs) using Large Reasoning Models (LRMs).However, this improved accuracy comes at the cost of high inference latency due to the length of generated reasoning sequences and the autoregressive nature of decoding.Our key insight in tackling these overheads is that LRM inference, and the reasoning that it embeds, is highly tolerant of approximations: complex tasks are typically broken down into simpler steps, each of which brings utility based on the semantic insight it provides for downstream steps rather than the exact tokens it generates.Accordingly, we introduce SpecReason, a system that automatically accelerates LRM inference by using a lightweight model to (speculatively) carry out simpler intermediate reasoning steps and reserving the costly base model only to assess (and potentially correct) the speculated outputs.Importantly, SpecReason's focus on exploiting the semantic flexibility of thinking tokens in preserving final-answer accuracy is complementary to prior speculation techniques, most notably speculative decoding, which demands token-level equivalence at each step.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Across a variety of reasoning benchmarks, SpecReason achieves 1.5-2.5$\times$ speedup over vanilla LRM inference while improving accuracy by 1.0-9.9\%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.648</span></span>Compared to speculative decoding without SpecReason, their combination yields an additional 19.4-44.2\% latency reduction.We open-source SpecReason at https://github.com/ruipeterpan/specreason.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in large language models have significantly improved their reasoning abilities, particularly through techniques involving search and backtracking.Backtracking naturally scales test-time compute by enabling sequential, linearized exploration via long chain-of-thought (CoT) generation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, this is not the only strategy for scaling test-time compute: parallel sampling with best-of-n selection provides an alternative that generates diverse solutions simultaneously. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.661</span></span>Despite the growing adoption of sequential search, its advantages over parallel sampling--especially under a fixed compute budget remain poorly understood.In this paper, we systematically compare these two approaches on two challenging reasoning tasks: CountDown and Sudoku.Surprisingly, we find that sequential search underperforms parallel sampling on CountDown but outperforms it on Sudoku, suggesting that backtracking is not universally beneficial.We identify two factors that can cause backtracking to degrade performance: (1) training on fixed search traces can lock models into suboptimal strategies, and (2) explicit CoT supervision can discourage "implicit" (non-verbalized) reasoning.Extending our analysis to reinforcement learning (RL), we show that models with backtracking capabilities benefit significantly from RL fine-tuning, while models without backtracking see limited, mixed gains.Together, these findings challenge the assumption that backtracking universally enhances LLM reasoning, instead revealing a complex interaction between task structure, training data, model scale, and learning paradigm.</p>

                  <p>Knowledge distillation (KD) is a promising solution to compress large language models (LLMs) by transferring their knowledge to smaller models.During this process, white-box KD methods usually minimize the distance between the output distributions of the teacher model and the student model to transfer more information.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, we reveal that the current white-box KD framework exhibits two limitations: a) bridging probability distributions from different output spaces will limit the similarity between the teacher model and the student model; b) this framework cannot be applied to LLMs with different vocabularies. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.624</span></span>One of the root causes for these limitations is that the distributions from the teacher and the student for KD are output by different prediction heads, which yield distributions in different output spaces and dimensions.Therefore, in this paper, we propose a dual-space knowledge distillation (DSKD) framework that unifies the prediction heads of the teacher and the student models for KD.Specifically, we first introduce two projectors with ideal initialization to project the teacher/student hidden states into the student/teacher representation spaces.After this, the hidden states from different models can share the same head and unify the output spaces of the distributions.Furthermore, we develop an exact token alignment (ETA) algorithm to align the same tokens in two differently-tokenized sequences.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Based on the above, our DSKD framework is a general KD framework that supports both off-policy and on-policy KD, and KD between any two LLMs regardless of their vocabularies. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.655</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on instruction-following, mathematical reasoning, and code generation benchmarks show that DSKD significantly outperforms existing methods based on the current white-box KD framework and surpasses other cross-tokenizer KD methods for LLMs with different vocabularies. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.649</span></span></p>

                  <p>Masculine defaults are widely recognized as a significant type of gender bias, but they are often unseen as they are under-researched.Masculine defaults involve three key parts: (i) the cultural context, (ii) the masculine characteristics or behaviors, and (iii) the reward for, or simply acceptance of, those masculine characteristics or behaviors.In this work, we study discourse-based masculine defaults, and propose a twofold framework for (i) the large-scale discovery and analysis of gendered discourse words in spoken content via our Gendered Discourse Correlation Framework (GDCF); and (ii) the measurement of the gender bias associated with these gendered discourse words in LLMs via our Discourse Word-Embedding Association Test (D-WEAT).We focus our study on podcasts, a popular and growing form of social media, analyzing 15,117 podcast episodes.We analyze correlations between gender and discourse words -- discovered via LDA and BERTopic -- to automatically form gendered discourse word lists.We then study the prevalence of these gendered discourse words in domain-specific contexts, and find that gendered discourse-based masculine defaults exist in the domains of business, technology/politics, and video games.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Next, we study the representation of these gendered discourse words from a state-of-the-art LLM embedding model from OpenAI, and find that the masculine discourse words have a more stable and robust representation than the feminine discourse words, which may result in better system performance on downstream tasks for men. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span>Hence, men are rewarded for their discourse patterns with better system performance by one of the state-of-the-art language models -- and this embedding disparity is a representational harm and a masculine default.</p>

                  <p>Modern code generation has made significant strides in functional correctness and execution efficiency.However, these systems often overlook a critical dimension in real-world software development: maintainability.To handle dynamic requirements with minimal rework, we propose MaintainCoder as a pioneering solution.It integrates Waterfall model, design patterns, and multi-agent collaboration to systematically enhance cohesion, reduce coupling, and improve adaptability.We also introduce MaintainBench, a benchmark comprising requirement changes and corresponding dynamic metrics on maintainance effort.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments demonstrate that existing code generation methods struggle to meet maintainability standards when requirements evolve. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.622</span></span>In contrast, MaintainCoder improves maintainability metrics by 14-30% with even higher correctness, i.e. pass@k.Our work not only provides the foundation of maintainable code generation, but also highlights the need for more holistic code quality research.Resources: https://github.com/IAAR-Shanghai/MaintainCoder.</p>
