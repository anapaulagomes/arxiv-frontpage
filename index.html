                  <p>This paper introduces DISINFOX, an open-source threat intelligence exchange platform for the structured collection, management, and dissemination of disinformation incidents and influence operations.Analysts can upload and correlate information manipulation and interference incidents, while clients can access and analyze the data through an interactive web interface or programmatically via a public API.This facilitates integration with other vendors, providing a unified view of cybersecurity and disinformation events.   The solution is fully containerized using Docker, comprising a web-based frontend for user interaction, a backend REST API for managing core functionalities, and a public API for structured data retrieval, enabling seamless integration with existing Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) workflows.In particular, DISINFOX models the incidents through DISARM Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs), a MITRE ATT&CK-like framework for disinformation, with a custom data model based on the Structured Threat Information eXpression (STIX2) standard.   As an open-source solution, DISINFOX provides a reproducible and extensible hub for researchers, analysts, and policymakers seeking to enhance the detection, investigation, and mitigation of disinformation threats.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The intelligence generated from a custom dataset has been tested and utilized by a local instance of OpenCTI, a mature CTI platform, via a custom-built connector, validating the platform with the exchange of more than 100 disinformation incidents. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.742</span></span></p>

                  <p>Nowadays, developers increasingly rely on solutions powered by Large Language Models (LLM) to assist them with their coding tasks.This makes it crucial to align these tools with human values to prevent malicious misuse.In this paper, we propose a comprehensive framework for assessing the potential harmfulness of LLMs within the software engineering domain.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We begin by developing a taxonomy of potentially harmful software engineering scenarios and subsequently, create a dataset of prompts based on this taxonomy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.762</span></span>To systematically assess the responses, we design and validate an automatic evaluator that classifies the outputs of a variety of LLMs both open-source and closed-source models, as well as general-purpose and code-specific LLMs.Furthermore, we investigate the impact of models size, architecture family, and alignment strategies on their tendency to generate harmful content.The results show significant disparities in the alignment of various LLMs for harmlessness.We find that some models and model families, such as Openhermes, are more harmful than others and that code-specific models do not perform better than their general-purpose counterparts.Notably, some fine-tuned models perform significantly worse than their base-models due to their design choices.On the other side, we find that larger models tend to be more helpful and are less likely to respond with harmful information.These results highlight the importance of targeted alignment strategies tailored to the unique challenges of software engineering tasks and provide a foundation for future work in this critical area.</p>

                  <p>Offline evaluation of recommender systems has traditionally treated the problem as a machine learning problem.In the classic case of recommending movies, where the user has provided explicit ratings of which movies they like and don't like, each user's ratings are split into test and train sets, and the evaluation task becomes to predict the held out test data using the training data.This machine learning style of evaluation makes the objective to recommend the movies that a user has watched and rated highly, which is not the same task as helping the user find movies that they would enjoy if they watched them.This mismatch in objective between evaluation and task is a compromise to avoid the cost of asking a user to evaluate recommendations by watching each movie.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>As a resource available for download, we offer an extension to the MovieLens-32M dataset that provides for new evaluation objectives. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.772</span></span>Our primary objective is to predict the movies that a user would be interested in watching, i.e. predict their watchlist.To construct this extension, we recruited MovieLens users, collected their profiles, made recommendations with a diverse set of algorithms, pooled the recommendations, and had the users assess the pools.Notably, we found that the traditional machine learning style of evaluation ranks the Popular algorithm, which recommends movies based on total number of ratings in the system, in the middle of the twenty-two recommendation runs we used to build the pools.In contrast, when we rank the runs by users' interest in watching movies, we find that recommending popular movies as a recommendation algorithm becomes one of the worst performing runs.It appears that by asking users to assess their personal recommendations, we can alleviate the popularity bias issues created by using information retrieval effectiveness measures for the evaluation of recommender systems.</p>

                  <p>Since the advent of reasoning-based large language models, many have found great success from distilling reasoning capabilities into student models.Such techniques have significantly bridged the gap between reasoning and standard LLMs on coding tasks.Despite this, much of the progress on distilling reasoning models remains locked behind proprietary datasets or lacks details on data curation, filtering and subsequent training.To address this, we construct a superior supervised fine-tuning (SFT) dataset that we use to achieve state-of-the-art coding capability results in models of various sizes.Our distilled models use only SFT to achieve 61.8% on LiveCodeBench and 24.6% on CodeContests, surpassing alternatives trained with reinforcement learning.We then perform analysis on the data sources used to construct our dataset, the impact of code execution filtering, and the importance of instruction/solution diversity.We observe that execution filtering negatively affected benchmark accuracy, leading us to prioritize instruction diversity over solution correctness.Finally, we also analyze the token efficiency and reasoning patterns utilized by these models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We will open-source these datasets and distilled models to the community. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.802</span></span></p>

                  <p>Referring expression segmentation (RES) aims at segmenting the entities' masks that match the descriptive language expression.While traditional RES methods primarily address object-level grounding, real-world scenarios demand a more versatile framework that can handle multiple levels of target granularity, such as multi-object, single object or part-level references.This introduces great challenges due to the diverse and nuanced ways users describe targets.However, existing datasets and models mainly focus on designing grounding specialists for object-level target localization, lacking the necessary data resources and unified frameworks for the more practical multi-grained RES.In this paper, we take a step further towards visual granularity unified RES task.To overcome the limitation of data scarcity, we introduce a new multi-granularity referring expression segmentation (MRES) task, alongside the RefCOCOm benchmark, which includes part-level annotations for advancing finer-grained visual understanding.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, we create MRES-32M, the largest visual grounding dataset, comprising over 32.2M masks and captions across 1M images, specifically designed for part-level vision-language grounding. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.809</span></span>To tackle the challenges of multi-granularity RES, we propose UniRES++, a unified multimodal large language model that integrates object-level and part-level RES tasks.UniRES++ incorporates targeted designs for fine-grained visual feature exploration.With the joint model architecture and parameters, UniRES++ achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, including RefCOCOm for MRES, gRefCOCO for generalized RES, and RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg for classic RES.To foster future research into multi-grained visual grounding, our RefCOCOm benchmark, MRES-32M dataset and model UniRES++ will be publicly available at https://github.com/Rubics-Xuan/MRES.</p>

                  <p>The rapid and unrestrained advancement of generative artificial intelligence (AI) presents a double-edged sword: while enabling unprecedented creativity, it also facilitates the generation of highly convincing deceptive content, undermining societal trust.As image generation techniques become increasingly sophisticated, detecting synthetic images is no longer just a binary task: it necessitates interpretable, context-aware methodologies that enhance trustworthiness and transparency.However, existing detection models primarily focus on classification, offering limited explanatory insights into image authenticity.In this work, we propose FakeScope, an expert multimodal model (LMM) tailored for AI-generated image forensics, which not only identifies AI-synthetic images with high accuracy but also provides rich, interpretable, and query-driven forensic insights.We first construct FakeChain dataset that contains linguistic authenticity reasoning based on visual trace evidence, developed through a novel human-machine collaborative framework.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Building upon it, we further present FakeInstruct, the largest multimodal instruction tuning dataset containing 2 million visual instructions tailored to enhance forensic awareness in LMMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.761</span></span>FakeScope achieves state-of-the-art performance in both closed-ended and open-ended forensic scenarios.It can distinguish synthetic images with high accuracy while offering coherent and insightful explanations, free-form discussions on fine-grained forgery attributes, and actionable enhancement strategies.Notably, despite being trained exclusively on qualitative hard labels, FakeScope demonstrates remarkable zero-shot quantitative capability on detection, enabled by our proposed token-based probability estimation strategy.Furthermore, FakeScope exhibits strong generalization and in-the-wild ability, ensuring its applicability in real-world scenarios.</p>

                  <p>In recent years, performance on existing anomaly detection benchmarks like MVTec AD and VisA has started to saturate in terms of segmentation AU-PRO, with state-of-the-art models often competing in the range of less than one percentage point.This lack of discriminatory power prevents a meaningful comparison of models and thus hinders progress of the field, especially when considering the inherent stochastic nature of machine learning results.We present MVTec AD 2, a collection of eight anomaly detection scenarios with more than 8000 high-resolution images.It comprises challenging and highly relevant industrial inspection use cases that have not been considered in previous datasets, including transparent and overlapping objects, dark-field and back light illumination, objects with high variance in the normal data, and extremely small defects.We provide comprehensive evaluations of state-of-the-art methods and show that their performance remains below 60% average AU-PRO.Additionally, our dataset provides test scenarios with lighting condition changes to assess the robustness of methods under real-world distribution shifts.We host a publicly accessible evaluation server that holds the pixel-precise ground truth of the test set (https://benchmark.mvtec.com/).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>All image data is available at https://www.mvtec.com/company/research/datasets/mvtec-ad-2. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.712</span></span></p>

                  <p>The rapid development of multimodal large language models has resulted in remarkable advancements in visual perception and understanding, consolidating several tasks into a single visual question-answering framework.However, these models are prone to hallucinations, which limit their reliability as artificial intelligence systems.While this issue is extensively researched in natural language processing and image captioning, there remains a lack of investigation of hallucinations in Low-level Visual Perception and Understanding (HLPU), especially in the context of image quality assessment tasks.We consider that these hallucinations arise from an absence of clear self-awareness within the models.To address this issue, we first introduce the HLPU instruction database, the first instruction database specifically focused on hallucinations in low-level vision tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This database contains approximately 200K question-answer pairs and comprises four subsets, each covering different types of instructions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.82</span></span>Subsequently, we propose the Self-Awareness Failure Elimination (SAFEQA) model, which utilizes image features, salient region features and quality features to improve the perception and comprehension abilities of the model in low-level vision tasks.Furthermore, we propose the Enhancing Self-Awareness Preference Optimization (ESA-PO) framework to increase the model's awareness of knowledge boundaries, thereby mitigating the incidence of hallucination.Finally, we conduct comprehensive experiments on low-level vision tasks, with the results demonstrating that our proposed method significantly enhances self-awareness of the model in these tasks and reduces hallucinations.Notably, our proposed method improves both accuracy and self-awareness of the proposed model and outperforms close-source models in terms of various evaluation metrics.</p>

                  <p>Diagrams serve as a fundamental form of visual language, representing complex concepts and their inter-relationships through structured symbols, shapes, and spatial arrangements.Unlike natural images, their inherently symbolic and abstract nature poses significant challenges for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).However, current benchmarks conflate perceptual and reasoning tasks, making it difficult to assess whether MLLMs genuinely understand mathematical diagrams beyond superficial pattern recognition.To address this gap, we introduce MATHGLANCE, a benchmark specifically designed to isolate and evaluate mathematical perception in MLLMs.MATHGLANCE comprises 1.2K images and 1.6K carefully curated questions spanning four perception tasks: shape classification, object counting, relationship identification, and object grounding, covering diverse domains including plane geometry, solid geometry, and graphical representations.Our evaluation of MLLMs reveals that their ability to understand diagrams is notably limited, particularly in fine-grained grounding tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In response, we construct GeoPeP, a perception-oriented dataset of 200K structured geometry image-text pairs explicitly annotated with geometric primitives and precise spatial relationships. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.746</span></span>Training MLLM on GeoPeP leads to significant gains in perceptual accuracy, which in turn substantially improves mathematical reasoning.Our benchmark and dataset establish critical standards for evaluating and advancing multimodal mathematical understanding, providing valuable resources and insights to foster future MLLM research.</p>

                  <p>Segmentation is a fundamental task in computer vision, with prompt-driven methods gaining prominence due to their flexibility.The recent Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated powerful point-prompt segmentation capabilities, while text-based segmentation models offer rich semantic understanding.However, existing approaches rarely explore how to effectively combine these complementary modalities for optimal segmentation performance.This paper presents BiPrompt-SAM, a novel dual-modal prompt segmentation framework that fuses the advantages of point and text prompts through an explicit selection mechanism.Specifically, we leverage SAM's inherent ability to generate multiple mask candidates, combined with a semantic guidance mask from text prompts, and explicitly select the most suitable candidate based on similarity metrics.This approach can be viewed as a simplified Mixture of Experts (MoE) system, where the point and text modules act as distinct "experts," and the similarity scoring serves as a rudimentary "gating network."<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conducted extensive evaluations on both the Endovis17 medical dataset and RefCOCO series natural image datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.822</span></span>On Endovis17, BiPrompt-SAM achieved 89.55\% mDice and 81.46\% mIoU, comparable to state-of-the-art specialized medical segmentation models.On the RefCOCO series datasets, our method attained 87.1\%, 86.5\%, and 85.8\% IoU, significantly outperforming existing approaches.Experiments demonstrate that our explicit dual-selection method effectively combines the spatial precision of point prompts with the semantic richness of text prompts, particularly excelling in scenarios involving semantically complex objects, multiple similar objects, and partial occlusions.BiPrompt-SAM not only provides a simple yet effective implementation but also offers a new perspective on multi-modal prompt fusion.</p>

                  <p>Recent studies have shown that bugs can be categorized into intrinsic and extrinsic types.Intrinsic bugs can be backtracked to specific changes in the version control system (VCS), while extrinsic bugs originate from external changes to the VCS and lack a direct bug-inducing change.Using only intrinsic bugs to train bug prediction models has been reported as beneficial to improve the performance of such models.However, there is currently no automated approach to identify intrinsic bugs.To bridge this gap, our study employs Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to automatically identify intrinsic bugs.Specifically, we utilize two embedding techniques, seBERT and TF-IDF, applied to the title and description text of bug reports.The resulting embeddings are fed into well-established machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The primary objective of this paper is to assess the performance of various NLP and machine learning techniques in identifying intrinsic bugs using the textual information extracted from bug reports. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span>The results demonstrate that both seBERT and TF-IDF can be effectively utilized for intrinsic bug identification.The highest performance scores were achieved by combining TF-IDF with the Decision Tree algorithm and utilizing the bug titles (yielding an F1 score of 78%).This was closely followed by seBERT, Support Vector Machine, and bug titles (with an F1 score of 77%).In summary, this paper introduces an innovative approach that automates the identification of intrinsic bugs using textual information derived from bug reports.</p>

                  <p>We present a multi-fidelity method for uncertainty quantification of parameter estimates in complex systems, leveraging generative models trained to sample the target conditional distribution.In the Bayesian inference setting, traditional parameter estimation methods rely on repeated simulations of potentially expensive forward models to determine the posterior distribution of the parameter values, which may result in computationally intractable workflows.Furthermore, methods such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) necessitate rerunning the entire algorithm for each new data observation, further increasing the computational burden.Hence, we propose a novel method for efficiently obtaining posterior distributions of parameter estimates for high-fidelity models given data observations of interest.The method first constructs a low-fidelity, conditional generative model capable of amortized Bayesian inference and hence rapid posterior density approximation over a wide-range of data observations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>When higher accuracy is needed for a specific data observation, the method employs adaptive refinement of the density approximation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.625</span></span>It uses outputs from the low-fidelity generative model to refine the parameter sampling space, ensuring efficient use of the computationally expensive high-fidelity solver.Subsequently, a high-fidelity, unconditional generative model is trained to achieve greater accuracy in the target posterior distribution.Both low- and high- fidelity generative models enable efficient sampling from the target posterior and do not require repeated simulation of the high-fidelity forward model.We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on several numerical examples, including cases with multi-modal densities, as well as an application in plasma physics for a runaway electron simulation model.</p>

                  <p>We consider a decentralized wireless network with several source-destination pairs sharing a limited number of orthogonal frequency bands.Sources learn to adapt their transmissions (specifically, their band selection strategy) over time, in a decentralized manner, without sharing information with each other.Sources can only observe the outcome of their own transmissions (i.e., success or collision), having no prior knowledge of the network size or of the transmission strategy of other sources.The goal of each source is to maximize their own throughput while striving for network-wide fairness.We propose a novel fully decentralized Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based solution that achieves fairness without coordination.The proposed Fair Share RL (FSRL) solution combines: (i) state augmentation with a semi-adaptive time reference; (ii) an architecture that leverages risk control and time difference likelihood; and (iii) a fairness-driven reward structure.We evaluate FSRL in more than 50 network settings with different number of agents, different amounts of available spectrum, in the presence of jammers, and in an ad-hoc setting.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Simulation results suggest that, when we compare FSRL with a common baseline RL algorithm from the literature, FSRL can be up to 89.0% fairer (as measured by Jain's fairness index) in stringent settings with several sources and a single frequency band, and 48.1% fairer on average. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span></p>

                  <p>Gestures are essential for enhancing co-speech communication, offering visual emphasis and complementing verbal interactions.While prior work has concentrated on point-level motion or fully supervised data-driven methods, we focus on co-speech gestures, advocating for weakly supervised learning and pixel-level motion deviations.We introduce a weakly supervised framework that learns latent representation deviations, tailored for co-speech gesture video generation.Our approach employs a diffusion model to integrate latent motion features, enabling more precise and nuanced gesture representation.By leveraging weakly supervised deviations in latent space, we effectively generate hand gestures and mouth movements, crucial for realistic video production.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments show our method significantly improves video quality, surpassing current state-of-the-art techniques. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.65</span></span></p>

                  <p>Accurate segmentation of cell nuclei in histopathology images is essential for numerous biomedical research and clinical applications.However, existing cell nucleus segmentation methods only consider a single dataset (i.e., primary domain), while neglecting to leverage supplementary data from diverse sources (i.e., auxiliary domains) to reduce overfitting and enhance the performance.Although incorporating multiple datasets could alleviate overfitting, it often exacerbates performance drops caused by domain shifts.In this work, we introduce Adversarial Multi-domain Alignment of Segment Anything Model (AMA-SAM) that extends the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to overcome these obstacles through two key innovations.First, we propose a Conditional Gradient Reversal Layer (CGRL), a multi-domain alignment module that harmonizes features from diverse domains to promote domain-invariant representation learning while preserving crucial discriminative features for the primary dataset.Second, we address SAM's inherent low-resolution output by designing a High-Resolution Decoder (HR-Decoder), which directly produces fine-grained segmentation maps in order to capture intricate nuclei boundaries in high-resolution histology images.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to adapt SAM for multi-dataset learning with application to histology nuclei segmentation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We validate our method on several publicly available datasets, demonstrating consistent and significant improvements over state-of-the-art approaches. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.645</span></span></p>

                  <p>Open-vocabulary querying in 3D Gaussian Splatting aims to identify semantically relevant regions within a 3D Gaussian representation based on a given text query.Prior work, such as LangSplat, addressed this task by retrieving these regions in the form of segmentation masks on 2D renderings.More recently, OpenGaussian introduced point-level querying, which directly selects a subset of 3D Gaussians.In this work, we propose a point-level querying method that builds upon LangSplat's framework.Our approach improves the framework in two key ways: (a) we leverage masklets from the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) to establish semantic consistent ground-truth for distilling the language Gaussians; (b) we introduces a novel two-step querying approach that first retrieves the distilled ground-truth and subsequently uses the ground-truth to query the individual Gaussians.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental evaluations on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.75</span></span>For instance, our method achieves an mIoU improvement of +20.42 on the 3D-OVS dataset.</p>

                  <p>Recently, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as a promising approach for robotic control.However, the deployment of DRL in real-world robots is hindered by its sensitivity to environmental perturbations.While existing whitebox adversarial attacks rely on local gradient information and apply uniform perturbations across all states to evaluate DRL robustness, they fail to account for temporal dynamics and state-specific vulnerabilities.To combat the above challenge, we first conduct a theoretical analysis of white-box attacks in DRL by establishing the adversarial victim-dynamics Markov decision process (AVD-MDP), to derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for a successful attack.Based on this, we propose a selective state-aware reinforcement adversarial attack method, named STAR, to optimize perturbation stealthiness and state visitation dispersion.STAR first employs a soft mask-based state-targeting mechanism to minimize redundant perturbations, enhancing stealthiness and attack effectiveness.Then, it incorporates an information-theoretic optimization objective to maximize mutual information between perturbations, environmental states, and victim actions, ensuring a dispersed state-visitation distribution that steers the victim agent into vulnerable states for maximum return reduction.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments demonstrate that STAR outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.665</span></span></p>

                  <p>This paper introduces a theoretical framework for a Transformer-augmented, sectional Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture that aims to enhance computational efficiency while preserving model scalability.Unlike conventional MoE models, which route entire token embeddings to selected experts, our approach portions the embedding dimension itself -- assigning segments of each token's representation to dedicated experts.To combat losses in token representation, we utilize a pre-expert transformer layer to recompute attention across tokens and reduce the sequence length dimensionality.We extend our theory by deriving optimal scaling laws that a non-linear relationship between the number of experts and factors such as model dimensionality, sequence length, and system overhead.These formulations yield closed-form and numerically-solvable expressions for identifying the optimal expert count under given architectural and hardware constraints.As a result, our framework not only provides theoretical bounds for computing efficiency with varying frameworks but also guides practical design choices for scaling large models effectively.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While empirical validation is pending, we present a comprehensive experimental road map to evaluate the framework's efficiency, scalability, and practicality in future work. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.667</span></span></p>

                  <p>3D graphics editing is crucial in applications like movie production and game design, yet it remains a time-consuming process that demands highly specialized domain expertise.Automating this process is challenging because graphical editing requires performing a variety of tasks, each requiring distinct skill sets.Recently, vision-language models (VLMs) have emerged as a powerful framework for automating the editing process, but their development and evaluation are bottlenecked by the lack of a comprehensive benchmark that requires human-level perception and presents real-world editing complexity.In this work, we present BlenderGym, the first comprehensive VLM system benchmark for 3D graphics editing.BlenderGym evaluates VLM systems through code-based 3D reconstruction tasks.We evaluate closed- and open-source VLM systems and observe that even the state-of-the-art VLM system struggles with tasks relatively easy for human Blender users.Enabled by BlenderGym, we study how inference scaling techniques impact VLM's performance on graphics editing tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Notably, our findings reveal that the verifier used to guide the scaling of generation can itself be improved through inference scaling, complementing recent insights on inference scaling of LLM generation in coding and math tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.679</span></span>We further show that inference compute is not uniformly effective and can be optimized by strategically distributing it between generation and verification.</p>

                  <p><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Maintaining and scaling software systems relies heavily on effective code refactoring, yet this process remains labor-intensive, requiring developers to carefully analyze existing codebases and prevent the introduction of new defects. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.652</span></span>Although recent advancements have leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate refactoring tasks, current solutions are constrained in scope and lack mechanisms to guarantee code compilability and successful test execution.In this work, we introduce MANTRA, a comprehensive LLM agent-based framework that automates method-level refactoring.MANTRA integrates Context-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Generation, coordinated Multi-Agent Collaboration, and Verbal Reinforcement Learning to emulate human decision-making during refactoring while preserving code correctness and readability.Our empirical study, conducted on 703 instances of "pure refactorings" (i.e., code changes exclusively involving structural improvements), drawn from 10 representative Java projects, covers the six most prevalent refactoring operations.Experimental results demonstrate that MANTRA substantially surpasses a baseline LLM model (RawGPT ), achieving an 82.8% success rate (582/703) in producing code that compiles and passes all tests, compared to just 8.7% (61/703) with RawGPT.Moreover, in comparison to IntelliJ's LLM-powered refactoring tool (EM-Assist), MANTRA exhibits a 50% improvement in generating Extract Method transformations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A usability study involving 37 professional developers further shows that refactorings performed by MANTRA are perceived to be as readable and reusable as human-written code, and in certain cases, even more favorable. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.652</span></span>These results highlight the practical advantages of MANTRA and emphasize the growing potential of LLM-based systems in advancing the automation of software refactoring tasks.</p>

                  <p>Researchers must ensure that the claims about the knowledge produced by their work are valid.However, validity is neither well-understood nor consistently established in design science, which involves the development and evaluation of artifacts (models, methods, instantiations, and theories) to solve problems.As a result, it is challenging to demonstrate and communicate the validity of knowledge claims about artifacts.This paper defines validity in design science and derives the Design Science Validity Framework and a process model for applying it.The framework comprises three high-level claim and validity types-criterion, causal, and context-as well as validity subtypes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The framework guides researchers in integrating validity considerations into projects employing design science and contributes to the growing body of research on design science methodology. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.61</span></span>It also provides a systematic way to articulate and validate the knowledge claims of design science projects.We apply the framework to examples from existing research and then use it to demonstrate the validity of knowledge claims about the framework itself.</p>

We present a systematic literature review (SLR) featuring 119 papers concerning the automation of code review tasks.We provide: (i) a categorization of the code review tasks automated in the literature; (ii) an overview of the under-the-hood techniques used for the automation, including the datasets used for training data-driven techniques; (iii) publicly available techniques and datasets used for their evaluation, with a description of the evaluation metrics usually adopted for each task.   The SLR is concluded by a discussion of the current limitations of the state-of-the-art, with insights for future research directions.</p>
