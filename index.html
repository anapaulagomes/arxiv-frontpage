                  <p>Various Earth anomalies have destroyed the stable, balanced state, resulting in fatalities and serious destruction of property.With the advantages of large-scale and precise observation, high-resolution remote sensing images have been widely used for anomaly monitoring and localization.Powered by the deep representation, the existing methods have achieved remarkable advances, primarily in classification and change detection techniques.However, labeled samples are difficult to acquire due to the low probability of anomaly occurrence, and the trained models are limited to fixed anomaly categories, which hinders the application for anomalies with few samples or unknown anomalies.In this paper, to tackle this problem, we propose the anomaly change detection (AnomalyCD) technique, which accepts time-series observations and learns to identify anomalous changes by learning from the historical normal change pattern.Compared to the existing techniques, AnomalyCD processes an unfixed number of time steps and can localize the various anomalies in a unified manner, without human supervision.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To benchmark AnomalyCD, we constructed a high-resolution dataset with time-series images dedicated to various Earth anomalies (the AnomalyCDD dataset). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.878</span></span>AnomalyCDD contains high-resolution (from 0.15 to 2.39 m/pixel), time-series (from 3 to 7 time steps), and large-scale images (1927.93 km2 in total) collected globally Furthermore, we developed a zero-shot baseline model (AnomalyCDM), which implements the AnomalyCD technique by extracting a general representation from the segment anything model (SAM) and conducting temporal comparison to distinguish the anomalous changes from normal changes.AnomalyCDM is designed as a two-stage workflow to enhance the efficiency, and has the ability to process the unseen images directly, without retraining for each scene.</p>

                  <p>Achieving 3D understanding of non-Lambertian objects is an important task with many useful applications, but most existing algorithms struggle to deal with such objects.One major obstacle towards progress in this field is the lack of holistic non-Lambertian benchmarks -- most benchmarks have low scene and object diversity, and none provide multi-layer 3D annotations for objects occluded by transparent surfaces.In this paper, we introduce LayeredFlow, a real world benchmark containing multi-layer ground truth annotation for optical flow of non-Lambertian objects.Compared to previous benchmarks, our benchmark exhibits greater scene and object diversity, with 150k high quality optical flow and stereo pairs taken over 185 indoor and outdoor scenes and 360 unique objects.Using LayeredFlow as evaluation data, we propose a new task called multi-layer optical flow.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To provide training data for this task, we introduce a large-scale densely-annotated synthetic dataset containing 60k images within 30 scenes tailored for non-Lambertian objects. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.91</span></span>Training on our synthetic dataset enables model to predict multi-layer optical flow, while fine-tuning existing optical flow methods on the dataset notably boosts their performance on non-Lambertian objects without compromising the performance on diffuse objects.Data is available at https://layeredflow.cs.princeton.edu.</p>

                  <p>Over the past decade, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved great success on machine learning tasks with relational data.However, recent studies have found that heterophily can cause significant performance degradation of GNNs, especially on node-level tasks.Numerous heterophilic benchmark datasets have been put forward to validate the efficacy of heterophily-specific GNNs and various homophily metrics have been designed to help people recognize these malignant datasets.Nevertheless, there still exist multiple pitfalls that severely hinder the proper evaluation of new models and metrics.In this paper, we point out three most serious pitfalls: 1) a lack of hyperparameter tuning; 2) insufficient model evaluation on the real challenging heterophilic datasets; 3) missing quantitative evaluation benchmark for homophily metrics on synthetic graphs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To overcome these challenges, we first train and fine-tune baseline models on $27$ most widely used benchmark datasets, categorize them into three distinct groups: malignant, benign and ambiguous heterophilic datasets, and identify the real challenging subsets of tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.71</span></span>To our best knowledge, we are the first to propose such taxonomy.Then, we re-evaluate $10$ heterophily-specific state-of-the-arts (SOTA) GNNs with fine-tuned hyperparameters on different groups of heterophilic datasets.Based on the model performance, we reassess their effectiveness on addressing heterophily challenge.At last, we evaluate $11$ popular homophily metrics on synthetic graphs with three different generation approaches.To compare the metrics strictly, we propose the first quantitative evaluation method based on Fr\'echet distance.</p>

                  <p>A robust face recognition model must be trained using datasets that include a large number of subjects and numerous samples per subject under varying conditions (such as pose, expression, age, noise, and occlusion).Due to ethical and privacy concerns, large-scale real face datasets have been discontinued, such as MS1MV3, and synthetic face generators have been proposed, utilizing GANs and Diffusion Models, such as SYNFace, SFace, DigiFace-1M, IDiff-Face, DCFace, and GANDiffFace, aiming to supply this demand.Some of these methods can produce high-fidelity realistic faces, but with low intra-class variance, while others generate high-variance faces with low identity consistency.In this paper, we propose a Triple Condition Diffusion Model (TCDiff) to improve face style transfer from real to synthetic faces through 2D and 3D facial constraints, enhancing face identity consistency while keeping the necessary high intra-class variance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Face recognition experiments using 1k, 2k, and 5k classes of our new dataset for training outperform state-of-the-art synthetic datasets in real face benchmarks such as LFW, CFP-FP, AgeDB, and BUPT. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.776</span></span>Our source code is available at: https://github.com/BOVIFOCR/tcdiff.</p>

                  <p>Over the recent years, the advancements in deep face recognition have fueled an increasing demand for large and diverse datasets.Nevertheless, the authentic data acquired to create those datasets is typically sourced from the web, which, in many cases, can lead to significant privacy issues due to the lack of explicit user consent.Furthermore, obtaining a demographically balanced, large dataset is even more difficult because of the natural imbalance in the distribution of images from different demographic groups.In this paper, we investigate the impact of demographically balanced authentic and synthetic data, both individually and in combination, on the accuracy and fairness of face recognition models.Initially, several generative methods were used to balance the demographic representations of the corresponding synthetic datasets.Then a state-of-the-art face encoder was trained and evaluated using (combinations of) synthetic and authentic images.Our findings emphasized two main points: (i) the increased effectiveness of training data generated by diffusion-based models in enhancing accuracy, whether used alone or combined with subsets of authentic data, and (ii) the minimal impact of incorporating balanced data from pre-trained generative methods on fairness (in nearly all tested scenarios using combined datasets, fairness scores remained either unchanged or worsened, even when compared to unbalanced authentic datasets).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Source code and data are available at \url{https://cutt.ly/AeQy1K5G} for reproducibility. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.74</span></span></p>

                  <p>Music streaming services often leverage sequential recommender systems to predict the best music to showcase to users based on past sequences of listening sessions.Nonetheless, most sequential recommendation methods ignore or insufficiently account for repetitive behaviors.This is a crucial limitation for music recommendation, as repeatedly listening to the same song over time is a common phenomenon that can even change the way users perceive this song.In this paper, we introduce PISA (Psychology-Informed Session embedding using ACT-R), a session-level sequential recommender system that overcomes this limitation.PISA employs a Transformer architecture learning embedding representations of listening sessions and users using attention mechanisms inspired by Anderson's ACT-R (Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational), a cognitive architecture modeling human information access and memory dynamics.This approach enables us to capture dynamic and repetitive patterns from user behaviors, allowing us to effectively predict the songs they will listen to in subsequent sessions, whether they are repeated or new ones.We demonstrate the empirical relevance of PISA using both publicly available listening data from Last.fm and proprietary data from Deezer, a global music streaming service, confirming the critical importance of repetition modeling for sequential listening session recommendation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Along with this paper, we publicly release our proprietary dataset to foster future research in this field, as well as the source code of PISA to facilitate its future use. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.742</span></span></p>

                  <p>ARINC 429 is a ubiquitous data bus for civil avionics, enabling reliable communication between devices from disparate manufacturers.However, ARINC 429 lacks any form of encryption or authentication, making it an inherently insecure communication protocol and rendering any connected avionics vulnerable to a range of attacks.We constructed a hardware-in-the-loop simulator with ARINC 429 buses, explored these vulnerabilities, and identified their potential to deny, degrade, or disrupt aircraft capabilities.We performed a denial-of-service attack against a multi-function display via a compromised ARINC 429 bus using commercially available tools, which succeeded in disabling important navigational aids.This proven attack on physical avionics illustrates the risk inherent in ARINC 429 and the need for the ability to detect these attacks.One potential mitigation is an intrusion detection system (IDS) trained on data collected from the electrical properties of the physical bus.Although previous research has demonstrated the feasibility of an IDS on an ARINC 429 bus, no IDS has been trained on data generated by avionics hardware.To facilitate this, we recorded voltage traces and message history generated by avionics and adversarial devices on the ARINC 429 bus.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first publicly available collection of hardware-generated ARINC 429 signal data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.794</span></span></p>

                  <p>Synthesizing 3D whole-bodies that realistically grasp objects is useful for animation, mixed reality, and robotics.This is challenging, because the hands and body need to look natural w.r.t.each other, the grasped object, as well as the local scene (i.e., a receptacle supporting the object).Only recent work tackles this, with a divide-and-conquer approach; it first generates a "guiding" right-hand grasp, and then searches for bodies that match this.However, the guiding-hand synthesis lacks controllability and receptacle awareness, so it likely has an implausible direction (i.e., a body can't match this without penetrating the receptacle) and needs corrections through major post-processing.Moreover, the body search needs exhaustive sampling and is expensive.These are strong limitations.We tackle these with a novel method called CWGrasp.Our key idea is that performing geometry-based reasoning "early on," instead of "too late," provides rich "control" signals for inference.To this end, CWGrasp first samples a plausible reaching-direction vector (used later for both the arm and hand) from a probabilistic model built via raycasting from the object and collision checking.Then, it generates a reaching body with a desired arm direction, as well as a "guiding" grasping hand with a desired palm direction that complies with the arm's one.Eventually, CWGrasp refines the body to match the "guiding" hand, while plausibly contacting the scene.Notably, generating already-compatible "parts" greatly simplifies the "whole."Moreover, CWGrasp uniquely tackles both right- and left-hand grasps.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate on the GRAB and ReplicaGrasp datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.72</span></span>CWGrasp outperforms baselines, at lower runtime and budget, while all components help performance.Code and models will be released.</p>

                  <p>Robust and realistic rendering for large-scale road scenes is essential in autonomous driving simulation.Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has made groundbreaking progress in neural rendering, but the general fidelity of large-scale road scene renderings is often limited by the input imagery, which usually has a narrow field of view and focuses mainly on the street-level local area.Intuitively, the data from the drone's perspective can provide a complementary viewpoint for the data from the ground vehicle's perspective, enhancing the completeness of scene reconstruction and rendering.However, training naively with aerial and ground images, which exhibit large view disparity, poses a significant convergence challenge for 3D-GS, and does not demonstrate remarkable improvements in performance on road views.In order to enhance the novel view synthesis of road views and to effectively use the aerial information, we design an uncertainty-aware training method that allows aerial images to assist in the synthesis of areas where ground images have poor learning outcomes instead of weighting all pixels equally in 3D-GS training like prior work did.We are the first to introduce the cross-view uncertainty to 3D-GS by matching the car-view ensemble-based rendering uncertainty to aerial images, weighting the contribution of each pixel to the training process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, to systematically quantify evaluation metrics, we assemble a high-quality synthesized dataset comprising both aerial and ground images for road scenes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.749</span></span></p>

                  <p>Facial wrinkle detection plays a crucial role in cosmetic dermatology.Precise manual segmentation of facial wrinkles is challenging and time-consuming, with inherent subjectivity leading to inconsistent results among graders.To address this issue, we propose two solutions.First, we build and release the first public facial wrinkle dataset, `FFHQ-Wrinkle', an extension of the NVIDIA FFHQ dataset.This dataset includes 1,000 images with human labels and 50,000 images with automatically generated weak labels.This dataset can foster the research community to develop advanced wrinkle detection algorithms.Second, we introduce a training strategy for U-Net-like encoder-decoder models to detect wrinkles across the face automatically.Our method employs a two-stage training strategy: texture map pretraining and finetuning on human-labeled data.Initially, we pretrain models on a large dataset with weak labels (N=50k) or masked texture maps generated through computer vision techniques, without human intervention.Subsequently, we finetune the models using human-labeled data (N=1k), which consists of manually labeled wrinkle masks.During finetuning, the network inputs a combination of RGB and masked texture maps, comprising four channels.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We effectively combine labels from multiple annotators to minimize subjectivity in manual labeling. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.661</span></span>Our strategies demonstrate improved segmentation performance in facial wrinkle segmentation both quantitatively and visually compared to existing pretraining methods.</p>

                  <p>Outlier detection (OD) has a vast literature as it finds numerous applications in environmental monitoring, cybersecurity, finance, and medicine to name a few.Being an inherently unsupervised task, model selection is a key bottleneck for OD (both algorithm and hyperparameter selection) without label supervision.There is a long list of techniques to choose from -- both classical algorithms and deep neural architectures -- and while several studies report their hyperparameter sensitivity, the literature is quite slim on unsupervised model selection -- limiting the effective use of OD in practice.In this paper we present FoMo-0D, for zero/0-shot OD exploring a transformative new direction that bypasses the hurdle of model selection altogether (!), thus breaking new ground.The fundamental idea behind FoMo-0D is the Prior-data Fitted Networks, recently introduced by Muller et al.(2022), which trains a Transformer model on a large body of synthetically generated data from a prior data distribution.In essence, FoMo-0D is a pretrained Foundation Model for zero/0-shot OD on tabular data, which can directly predict the (outlier/inlier) label of any test data at inference time, by merely a single forward pass -- making obsolete the need for choosing an algorithm/architecture, tuning its associated hyperparameters, and even training any model parameters when given a new OD dataset.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on 57 public benchmark datasets against 26 baseline methods show that FoMo-0D performs statistically no different from the top 2nd baseline, while significantly outperforming the majority of the baselines, with an average inference time of 7.7 ms per test sample. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.63</span></span></p>

                  <p>Open-source, multilingual medical large language models (LLMs) have the potential to serve linguistically diverse populations across different regions.Adapting generic LLMs for healthcare often requires continual pretraining, but this approach is computationally expensive and sometimes impractical.Instruction fine-tuning on a specific task may not always guarantee optimal performance due to the lack of broader domain knowledge that the model needs to understand and reason effectively in diverse scenarios.To address these challenges, we introduce two multilingual instruction fine-tuning datasets, MMed-IFT and MMed-IFT-MC, containing over 200k high-quality medical samples in six languages.We propose a two-stage training paradigm: the first stage injects general medical knowledge using MMed-IFT, while the second stage fine-tunes task-specific multiple-choice questions with MMed-IFT-MC.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our method achieves competitive results on both English and multilingual benchmarks, striking a balance between computational efficiency and performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.666</span></span>We plan to make our dataset and model weights public at \url{https://github.com/SpassMed/Med-Llama3} in the future.</p>

                  <p>Over the past decade, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved great success on machine learning tasks with relational data.However, recent studies have found that heterophily can cause significant performance degradation of GNNs, especially on node-level tasks.Numerous heterophilic benchmark datasets have been put forward to validate the efficacy of heterophily-specific GNNs and various homophily metrics have been designed to help people recognize these malignant datasets.Nevertheless, there still exist multiple pitfalls that severely hinder the proper evaluation of new models and metrics.In this paper, we point out three most serious pitfalls: 1) a lack of hyperparameter tuning; 2) insufficient model evaluation on the real challenging heterophilic datasets; 3) missing quantitative evaluation benchmark for homophily metrics on synthetic graphs.To overcome these challenges, we first train and fine-tune baseline models on $27$ most widely used benchmark datasets, categorize them into three distinct groups: malignant, benign and ambiguous heterophilic datasets, and identify the real challenging subsets of tasks.To our best knowledge, we are the first to propose such taxonomy.Then, we re-evaluate $10$ heterophily-specific state-of-the-arts (SOTA) GNNs with fine-tuned hyperparameters on different groups of heterophilic datasets.Based on the model performance, we reassess their effectiveness on addressing heterophily challenge.At last, we evaluate $11$ popular homophily metrics on synthetic graphs with three different generation approaches.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To compare the metrics strictly, we propose the first quantitative evaluation method based on Fr\'echet distance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.706</span></span></p>

                  <p>State-of-the-art techniques for 3D reconstruction are largely based on volumetric scene representations, which require sampling multiple points to compute the color arriving along a ray.Using these representations for more general inverse rendering -- reconstructing geometry, materials, and lighting from observed images -- is challenging because recursively path-tracing such volumetric representations is expensive.Recent works alleviate this issue through the use of radiance caches: data structures that store the steady-state, infinite-bounce radiance arriving at any point from any direction.However, these solutions rely on approximations that introduce bias into the renderings and, more importantly, into the gradients used for optimization.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We present a method that avoids these approximations while remaining computationally efficient. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.69</span></span>In particular, we leverage two techniques to reduce variance for unbiased estimators of the rendering equation: (1) an occlusion-aware importance sampler for incoming illumination and (2) a fast cache architecture that can be used as a control variate for the radiance from a high-quality, but more expensive, volumetric cache.We show that by removing these biases our approach improves the generality of radiance cache based inverse rendering, as well as increasing quality in the presence of challenging light transport effects such as specular reflections.</p>

                  <p>Subject-driven text-to-image generation has witnessed remarkable advancements in its ability to learn and capture characteristics of a subject using only a limited number of images.However, existing methods commonly rely on high-quality images for training and may struggle to generate reasonable images when the input images are blemished by artifacts.This is primarily attributed to the inadequate capability of current techniques in distinguishing subject-related features from disruptive artifacts.In this paper, we introduce ArtiFade to tackle this issue and successfully generate high-quality artifact-free images from blemished datasets.Specifically, ArtiFade exploits fine-tuning of a pre-trained text-to-image model, aiming to remove artifacts.The elimination of artifacts is achieved by utilizing a specialized dataset that encompasses both unblemished images and their corresponding blemished counterparts during fine-tuning.ArtiFade also ensures the preservation of the original generative capabilities inherent within the diffusion model, thereby enhancing the overall performance of subject-driven methods in generating high-quality and artifact-free images.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We further devise evaluation benchmarks tailored for this task. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.716</span></span>Through extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments, we demonstrate the generalizability of ArtiFade in effective artifact removal under both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios.</p>

                  <p>Since the advent of ChatGPT, Large Language Models (LLMs) have excelled in various tasks but remain largely as black-box systems.Consequently, their development relies heavily on data-driven approaches, limiting performance enhancement through changes in internal architecture and reasoning pathways.As a result, many researchers have begun exploring the potential internal mechanisms of LLMs, aiming to identify the essence of their reasoning bottlenecks, with most studies focusing on attention heads.Our survey aims to shed light on the internal reasoning processes of LLMs by concentrating on the interpretability and underlying mechanisms of attention heads.We first distill the human thought process into a four-stage framework: Knowledge Recalling, In-Context Identification, Latent Reasoning, and Expression Preparation.Using this framework, we systematically review existing research to identify and categorize the functions of specific attention heads.Furthermore, we summarize the experimental methodologies used to discover these special heads, dividing them into two categories: Modeling-Free methods and Modeling-Required methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Also, we outline relevant evaluation methods and benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.714</span></span>Finally, we discuss the limitations of current research and propose several potential future directions.Our reference list is open-sourced at \url{https://github.com/IAAR-Shanghai/Awesome-Attention-Heads}.</p>

                  <p>Transfer learning based on full fine-tuning (FFT) of the pre-trained encoder and task-specific decoder becomes increasingly complex as deep models grow exponentially.Parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) approaches using adapters consisting of small learnable layers have emerged as an alternative to FFT, achieving comparable performance while maintaining high training efficiency.However, the inflexibility of the adapter with respect to input instances limits its capability of learning task-specific information in diverse downstream tasks.In this paper, we propose a novel PEFT approach, input-Conditioned transFormer, termed iConFormer, that leverages a dynamic adapter conditioned on the input instances.To secure flexible learning ability on input instances in various downstream tasks, we introduce an input-Conditioned Network (iCoN) in the dynamic adapter that enables instance-level feature transformation.To be specific, iCoN generates channel-wise convolutional kernels for each feature and transform it using adaptive convolution process to effectively capture task-specific and fine-grained details tailor to downstream tasks.Experimental results demonstrate that by tuning just 1.6% to 2.8% of the Transformer backbone parameters, iConFormer achieves performance comparable to FFT in monocular depth estimation and semantic segmentation, while outperforming it in image classification and instance segmentation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Also, the proposed method consistently outperforms recent PEFT methods for all the tasks mentioned above. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.64</span></span></p>

                  <p>The predominant method for computing confidence intervals (CI) in few-shot learning (FSL) is based on sampling the tasks with replacement, i.e.\ allowing the same samples to appear in multiple tasks.This makes the CI misleading in that it takes into account the randomness of the sampler but not the data itself.To quantify the extent of this problem, we conduct a comparative analysis between CIs computed with and without replacement.These reveal a notable underestimation by the predominant method.This observation calls for a reevaluation of how we interpret confidence intervals and the resulting conclusions in FSL comparative studies.Our research demonstrates that the use of paired tests can partially address this issue.Additionally, we explore methods to further reduce the (size of the) CI by strategically sampling tasks of a specific size.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also introduce a new optimized benchmark, which can be accessed at https://github.com/RafLaf/FSL-benchmark-again <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.745</span></span></p>

                  <p>Few-shot image classifiers are designed to recognize and classify new data with minimal supervision and limited data but often show reliance on spurious correlations between classes and spurious attributes, known as spurious bias.Spurious correlations commonly hold in certain samples and few-shot classifiers can suffer from spurious bias induced from them.There is an absence of an automatic benchmarking system to assess the robustness of few-shot classifiers against spurious bias.In this paper, we propose a systematic and rigorous benchmark framework, termed FewSTAB, to fairly demonstrate and quantify varied degrees of robustness of few-shot classifiers to spurious bias.FewSTAB creates few-shot evaluation tasks with biased attributes so that using them for predictions can demonstrate poor performance.To construct these tasks, we propose attribute-based sample selection strategies based on a pre-trained vision-language model, eliminating the need for manual dataset curation.This allows FewSTAB to automatically benchmark spurious bias using any existing test data.FewSTAB offers evaluation results in a new dimension along with a new design guideline for building robust classifiers.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, it can benchmark spurious bias in varied degrees and enable designs for varied degrees of robustness. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span>Its effectiveness is demonstrated through experiments on ten few-shot learning methods across three datasets.We hope our framework can inspire new designs of robust few-shot classifiers.Our code is available at https://github.com/gtzheng/FewSTAB.</p>

                  <p>In the last years, many neural network-based approaches have been proposed to tackle combinatorial optimization problems such as routing problems.Many of these approaches are based on graph neural networks (GNNs) or related transformers, operating on the Euclidean coordinates representing the routing problems.However, GNNs are inherently not well suited to operate on dense graphs, such as in routing problems.Furthermore, models operating on Euclidean coordinates cannot be applied to non-Euclidean versions of routing problems that are often found in real-world settings.To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel GNN-related edge-based neural model called Graph Edge Attention Network (GREAT).We evaluate the performance of GREAT in the edge-classification task to predict optimal edges in the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).We can use such a trained GREAT model to produce sparse TSP graph instances, keeping only the edges GREAT finds promising.Compared to other, non-learning-based methods to sparsify TSP graphs, GREAT can produce very sparse graphs while keeping most of the optimal edges.Furthermore, we build a reinforcement learning-based GREAT framework which we apply to Euclidean and non-Euclidean asymmetric TSP.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This framework achieves state-of-the-art results. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.61</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent advances in text-to-image personalization have enabled high-quality and controllable image synthesis for user-provided concepts.However, existing methods still struggle to balance identity preservation with text alignment.Our approach is based on the fact that generating prompt-aligned images requires a precise semantic understanding of the prompt, which involves accurately processing the interactions between the new concept and its surrounding context tokens within the CLIP text encoder.To address this, we aim to embed the new concept properly into the input embedding space of the text encoder, allowing for seamless integration with existing tokens.We introduce Context Regularization (CoRe), which enhances the learning of the new concept's text embedding by regularizing its context tokens in the prompt.This is based on the insight that appropriate output vectors of the text encoder for the context tokens can only be achieved if the new concept's text embedding is correctly learned.CoRe can be applied to arbitrary prompts without requiring the generation of corresponding images, thus improving the generalization of the learned text embedding.Additionally, CoRe can serve as a test-time optimization technique to further enhance the generations for specific prompts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms several baseline methods in both identity preservation and text alignment. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.639</span></span>Code will be made publicly available.</p>

                  <p>Time series forecasting requires balancing short-term and long-term dependencies for accurate predictions.Existing methods mainly focus on long-term dependency modeling, neglecting the complexities of short-term dynamics, which may hinder performance.Transformers are superior in modeling long-term dependencies but are criticized for their quadratic computational cost.Mamba provides a near-linear alternative but is reported less effective in time series longterm forecasting due to potential information loss.Current architectures fall short in offering both high efficiency and strong performance for long-term dependency modeling.To address these challenges, we introduce Mixture of Universals (MoU), a versatile model to capture both short-term and long-term dependencies for enhancing performance in time series forecasting.MoU is composed of two novel designs: Mixture of Feature Extractors (MoF), an adaptive method designed to improve time series patch representations for short-term dependency, and Mixture of Architectures (MoA), which hierarchically integrates Mamba, FeedForward, Convolution, and Self-Attention architectures in a specialized order to model long-term dependency from a hybrid perspective.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining relatively low computational costs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.676</span></span>Extensive experiments on seven real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of MoU.

                  <p>By harnessing the delay-Doppler (DD) resource domain, orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) substantially improves the communication performance under high-mobility scenarios by maintaining quasi-time-invariant channel characteristics.However, conventional multiple access (MA) techniques fail to efficiently support OTFS in the face of diverse communication requirements.Recently, multi-dimensional MA (MDMA) has emerged as a flexible channel access technique by elastically exploiting multi-domain resources for tailored service provision.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Therefore, we conceive an elastic multi-domain resource utilization mechanism for a novel multi-user OTFS-MDMA system by leveraging user-specific channel characteristics across the DD, power, and spatial resource domains. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span>Specifically, we divide all DD resource bins into separate subregions called DD resource slots (RSs), each of which supports a fraction of users, thus reducing the multi-user interference.Then, the most suitable MA, including orthogonal, non-orthogonal, or spatial division MA (OMA/ NOMA/ SDMA), will be selected with each RS based on the interference levels in the power and spatial domains, thus enhancing the spectrum efficiency.Then, we jointly optimize the user assignment, access scheme selection, and power allocation in all DD RSs to maximize the weighted sum-rate subject to their minimum rate and various practical constraints.Since this results in a non-convex problem, we develop a dynamic programming and monotonic optimization (DPMO) method to find the globally optimal solution in the special case of disregarding rate constraints.Subsequently, we apply a low-complexity algorithm to find sub-optimal solutions in general cases.</p>

                  <p>This paper presents a novel conversational AI-enabled active ideation interface as a creative idea-generation tool to assist novice designers in mitigating the initial latency and ideation bottlenecks that are commonly observed.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It is a dynamic, interactive, and contextually responsive approach, actively involving a large language model (LLM) from the domain of natural language processing (NLP) in artificial intelligence (AI) to produce multiple statements of potential ideas for different design problems. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.668</span></span>Integrating such AI models with ideation creates what we refer to as an Active Ideation scenario, which helps foster continuous dialogue-based interaction, context-sensitive conversation, and prolific idea generation.A pilot study was conducted with thirty novice designers to generate ideas for given problems using traditional methods and the new CAI-based interface.The key parameters of fluency, novelty, and variety were used to compare the outcomes qualitatively by a panel of experts.The findings demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed tool for generating prolific, diverse and novel ideas.The interface was enhanced by incorporating a prompt-engineered structured dialogue style for each ideation stage to make it uniform and more convenient for the designers.The resulting responses of such a structured CAI interface were found to be more succinct and aligned towards the subsequent design stage, namely conceptualization.The paper thus established the rich potential of using Generative AI (Gen-AI) for the early ill-structured phase of the creative product design process.</p>

                  <p>Reliable simulations are critical for analyzing and understanding complex systems, but their accuracy depends on correct input data.Incorrect inputs such as invalid or out-of-range values, missing data, and format inconsistencies can cause simulation crashes or unnoticed result distortions, ultimately undermining the validity of the conclusions.This paper presents a methodology for verifying the validity of input data in simulations, a process we term model input verification (MIV).We implement this approach in FabGuard, a toolset that uses established data schema and validation tools for the specific needs of simulation modeling.We introduce a formalism for categorizing MIV patterns and offer a streamlined verification pipeline that integrates into existing simulation workflows.FabGuard's applicability is demonstrated across three diverse domains: conflict-driven migration, disaster evacuation, and disease spread models.We also explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for automating constraint generation and inference.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In a case study with a migration simulation, LLMs not only correctly inferred 22 out of 23 developer-defined constraints, but also identified errors in existing constraints and proposed new, valid constraints. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.675</span></span>Our evaluation demonstrates that MIV is feasible on large datasets, with FabGuard efficiently processing 12,000 input files in 140 seconds and maintaining consistent performance across varying file sizes.</p>

                  <p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is an effective approach for aligning language models to human preferences.Central to RLHF is learning a reward function for scoring human preferences.Two main approaches for learning a reward model are 1) training an EXplicit Reward Model (EXRM) as in RLHF, and 2) using an implicit reward learned from preference data through methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).Prior work has shown that the implicit reward model of DPO (denoted as DPORM) can approximate an EXRM in the limit.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>DPORM's effectiveness directly implies the optimality of the learned policy, and also has practical implication for LLM alignment methods including iterative DPO. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.624</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, it is unclear how well DPORM empirically matches the performance of EXRM. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This work studies the accuracy at distinguishing preferred and rejected answers for both DPORM and EXRM. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.641</span></span>Our findings indicate that even though DPORM fits the training dataset comparably, it generalizes less effectively than EXRM, especially when the validation datasets contain distribution shifts.Across five out-of-distribution settings, DPORM has a mean drop in accuracy of 3% and a maximum drop of 7%.These findings highlight that DPORM has limited generalization ability and substantiates the integration of an explicit reward model in iterative DPO approaches.</p>

                  <p>Control-flow leakage (CFL) attacks enable an attacker to expose control-flow decisions of a victim program via side-channel observations.Linearization (i.e., elimination) of secret-dependent control flow is the main countermeasure against these attacks, yet it comes at a non-negligible cost.Conversely, balancing secret-dependent branches often incurs a smaller overhead, but is notoriously insecure on high-end processors.Hence, linearization has been widely believed to be the only effective countermeasure against CFL attacks.In this paper, we challenge this belief and investigate an unexplored alternative: how to securely balance secret-dependent branches on higher-end processors?   We propose Libra, a generic and principled hardware-software codesign to efficiently address CFL on high-end processors.We perform a systematic classification of hardware primitives leaking control flow from the literature, and provide guidelines to handle them with our design.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Importantly, Libra enables secure control-flow balancing without the need to disable performance-critical hardware such as the instruction cache and the prefetcher. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span>We formalize the semantics of Libra and propose a code transformation algorithm for securing programs, which we prove correct and secure.Finally, we implement and evaluate Libra on an out-of-order RISC-V processor, showing performance overhead on par with insecure balanced code, and outperforming state-of-the-art linearized code by 19.3%.</p>

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to early detection of performance regressions by bridging the local performance data generated by component-level testing and the system-level architectural models.Our approach uses local performance data to identify deviations at the component level, and then propagate these deviations to the architectural model.We then use the architectural model to predict regressions in the performance of the overall system.We evaluate our approach on two open-source benchmark systems and show that it can effectively detect end-to-end system performance regressions from local performance deviations with different intensities and under various system workloads.More importantly, our approach can detect regressions as early as in the development phase, in contrast to existing approaches that require the system to be fully built and deployed.Our approach is lightweight and can complement traditional system performance testing when testing resources are scarce.</p>
