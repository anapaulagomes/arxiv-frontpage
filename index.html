                  <p>Imitation learning has emerged as a promising approach towards building generalist robots.However, scaling imitation learning for large robot foundation models remains challenging due to its reliance on high-quality expert demonstrations.Meanwhile, large amounts of video data depicting a wide range of environments and diverse behaviors are readily available.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This data provides a rich source of information about real-world dynamics and agent-environment interactions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.789</span></span>Leveraging this data directly for imitation learning, however, has proven difficult due to the lack of action annotation required for most contemporary methods.In this work, we present Unified World Models (UWM), a framework that allows for leveraging both video and action data for policy learning.Specifically, a UWM integrates an action diffusion process and a video diffusion process within a unified transformer architecture, where independent diffusion timesteps govern each modality.We show that by simply controlling each diffusion timestep, UWM can flexibly represent a policy, a forward dynamics, an inverse dynamics, and a video generator.Through simulated and real-world experiments, we show that: (1) UWM enables effective pretraining on large-scale multitask robot datasets with both dynamics and action predictions, resulting in more generalizable and robust policies than imitation learning, (2) UWM naturally facilitates learning from action-free video data through independent control of modality-specific diffusion timesteps, further improving the performance of finetuned policies.Our results suggest that UWM offers a promising step toward harnessing large, heterogeneous datasets for scalable robot learning, and provides a simple unification between the often disparate paradigms of imitation learning and world modeling.Videos and code are available at https://weirdlabuw.github.io/uwm/.</p>

                  <p>Diffusion models are widely used for image editing tasks.Existing editing methods often design a representation manipulation procedure by curating an edit direction in the text embedding or score space.However, such a procedure faces a key challenge: overestimating the edit strength harms visual consistency while underestimating it fails the editing task.Notably, each source image may require a different editing strength, and it is costly to search for an appropriate strength via trial-and-error.To address this challenge, we propose Concept Lancet (CoLan), a zero-shot plug-and-play framework for principled representation manipulation in diffusion-based image editing.At inference time, we decompose the source input in the latent (text embedding or diffusion score) space as a sparse linear combination of the representations of the collected visual concepts.This allows us to accurately estimate the presence of concepts in each image, which informs the edit.Based on the editing task (replace/add/remove), we perform a customized concept transplant process to impose the corresponding editing direction.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To sufficiently model the concept space, we curate a conceptual representation dataset, CoLan-150K, which contains diverse descriptions and scenarios of visual terms and phrases for the latent dictionary. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.742</span></span>Experiments on multiple diffusion-based image editing baselines show that methods equipped with CoLan achieve state-of-the-art performance in editing effectiveness and consistency preservation.</p>

                  <p>Nowadays, developers increasingly rely on solutions powered by Large Language Models (LLM) to assist them with their coding tasks.This makes it crucial to align these tools with human values to prevent malicious misuse.In this paper, we propose a comprehensive framework for assessing the potential harmfulness of LLMs within the software engineering domain.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We begin by developing a taxonomy of potentially harmful software engineering scenarios and subsequently, create a dataset of prompts based on this taxonomy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.762</span></span>To systematically assess the responses, we design and validate an automatic evaluator that classifies the outputs of a variety of LLMs both open-source and closed-source models, as well as general-purpose and code-specific LLMs.Furthermore, we investigate the impact of models size, architecture family, and alignment strategies on their tendency to generate harmful content.The results show significant disparities in the alignment of various LLMs for harmlessness.We find that some models and model families, such as Openhermes, are more harmful than others and that code-specific models do not perform better than their general-purpose counterparts.Notably, some fine-tuned models perform significantly worse than their base-models due to their design choices.On the other side, we find that larger models tend to be more helpful and are less likely to respond with harmful information.These results highlight the importance of targeted alignment strategies tailored to the unique challenges of software engineering tasks and provide a foundation for future work in this critical area.</p>

                  <p>Offline evaluation of recommender systems has traditionally treated the problem as a machine learning problem.In the classic case of recommending movies, where the user has provided explicit ratings of which movies they like and don't like, each user's ratings are split into test and train sets, and the evaluation task becomes to predict the held out test data using the training data.This machine learning style of evaluation makes the objective to recommend the movies that a user has watched and rated highly, which is not the same task as helping the user find movies that they would enjoy if they watched them.This mismatch in objective between evaluation and task is a compromise to avoid the cost of asking a user to evaluate recommendations by watching each movie.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>As a resource available for download, we offer an extension to the MovieLens-32M dataset that provides for new evaluation objectives. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.772</span></span>Our primary objective is to predict the movies that a user would be interested in watching, i.e. predict their watchlist.To construct this extension, we recruited MovieLens users, collected their profiles, made recommendations with a diverse set of algorithms, pooled the recommendations, and had the users assess the pools.Notably, we found that the traditional machine learning style of evaluation ranks the Popular algorithm, which recommends movies based on total number of ratings in the system, in the middle of the twenty-two recommendation runs we used to build the pools.In contrast, when we rank the runs by users' interest in watching movies, we find that recommending popular movies as a recommendation algorithm becomes one of the worst performing runs.It appears that by asking users to assess their personal recommendations, we can alleviate the popularity bias issues created by using information retrieval effectiveness measures for the evaluation of recommender systems.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in large-scale generative models have significantly improved the quality and diversity of 3D shape generation.However, most existing methods focus primarily on generating static 3D models, overlooking the potentially dynamic nature of certain shapes, such as humanoids, animals, and insects.To address this gap, we focus on rigging, a fundamental task in animation that establishes skeletal structures and skinning for 3D models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we introduce OmniRig, the first large-scale rigging dataset, comprising 79,499 meshes with detailed skeleton and skinning information. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.783</span></span>Unlike traditional benchmarks that rely on predefined standard poses (e.g., A-pose, T-pose), our dataset embraces diverse shape categories, styles, and poses.Leveraging this rich dataset, we propose ARMO, a novel rigging framework that utilizes an autoregressive model to predict both joint positions and connectivity relationships in a unified manner.By treating the skeletal structure as a complete graph and discretizing it into tokens, we encode the joints using an auto-encoder to obtain a latent embedding and an autoregressive model to predict the tokens.A mesh-conditioned latent diffusion model is used to predict the latent embedding for conditional skeleton generation.Our method addresses the limitations of regression-based approaches, which often suffer from error accumulation and suboptimal connectivity estimation.Through extensive experiments on the OmniRig dataset, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in skeleton prediction, demonstrating improved generalization across diverse object categories.The code and dataset will be made public for academic use upon acceptance.</p>

                  <p>Segmentation is a fundamental task in computer vision, with prompt-driven methods gaining prominence due to their flexibility.The recent Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated powerful point-prompt segmentation capabilities, while text-based segmentation models offer rich semantic understanding.However, existing approaches rarely explore how to effectively combine these complementary modalities for optimal segmentation performance.This paper presents BiPrompt-SAM, a novel dual-modal prompt segmentation framework that fuses the advantages of point and text prompts through an explicit selection mechanism.Specifically, we leverage SAM's inherent ability to generate multiple mask candidates, combined with a semantic guidance mask from text prompts, and explicitly select the most suitable candidate based on similarity metrics.This approach can be viewed as a simplified Mixture of Experts (MoE) system, where the point and text modules act as distinct "experts," and the similarity scoring serves as a rudimentary "gating network."<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conducted extensive evaluations on both the Endovis17 medical dataset and RefCOCO series natural image datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.822</span></span>On Endovis17, BiPrompt-SAM achieved 89.55\% mDice and 81.46\% mIoU, comparable to state-of-the-art specialized medical segmentation models.On the RefCOCO series datasets, our method attained 87.1\%, 86.5\%, and 85.8\% IoU, significantly outperforming existing approaches.Experiments demonstrate that our explicit dual-selection method effectively combines the spatial precision of point prompts with the semantic richness of text prompts, particularly excelling in scenarios involving semantically complex objects, multiple similar objects, and partial occlusions.BiPrompt-SAM not only provides a simple yet effective implementation but also offers a new perspective on multi-modal prompt fusion.</p>

                  <p>Recently, building retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems to enhance the capability of large language models (LLMs) has become a common practice.Especially in the legal domain, previous judicial decisions play a significant role under the doctrine of stare decisis which emphasizes the importance of making decisions based on (retrieved) prior documents.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, the overall performance of RAG system depends on many components: (1) retrieval corpora, (2) retrieval algorithms, (3) rerankers, (4) LLM backbones, and (5) evaluation metrics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.608</span></span>Here we propose LRAGE, an open-source tool for holistic evaluation of RAG systems focusing on the legal domain.LRAGE provides GUI and CLI interfaces to facilitate seamless experiments and investigate how changes in the aforementioned five components affect the overall accuracy.We validated LRAGE using multilingual legal benches including Korean (KBL), English (LegalBench), and Chinese (LawBench) by demonstrating how the overall accuracy changes when varying the five components mentioned above.The source code is available at https://github.com/hoorangyee/LRAGE.</p>

                  <p>Recent studies have shown that bugs can be categorized into intrinsic and extrinsic types.Intrinsic bugs can be backtracked to specific changes in the version control system (VCS), while extrinsic bugs originate from external changes to the VCS and lack a direct bug-inducing change.Using only intrinsic bugs to train bug prediction models has been reported as beneficial to improve the performance of such models.However, there is currently no automated approach to identify intrinsic bugs.To bridge this gap, our study employs Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to automatically identify intrinsic bugs.Specifically, we utilize two embedding techniques, seBERT and TF-IDF, applied to the title and description text of bug reports.The resulting embeddings are fed into well-established machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors.The primary objective of this paper is to assess the performance of various NLP and machine learning techniques in identifying intrinsic bugs using the textual information extracted from bug reports.The results demonstrate that both seBERT and TF-IDF can be effectively utilized for intrinsic bug identification.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The highest performance scores were achieved by combining TF-IDF with the Decision Tree algorithm and utilizing the bug titles (yielding an F1 score of 78%). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.645</span></span>This was closely followed by seBERT, Support Vector Machine, and bug titles (with an F1 score of 77%).In summary, this paper introduces an innovative approach that automates the identification of intrinsic bugs using textual information derived from bug reports.</p>

                  <p>While AI agents have shown remarkable performance at various tasks, they still struggle with complex multi-modal applications, structured generation and strategic planning.Improvements via standard fine-tuning is often impractical, as solving agentic tasks usually relies on black box API access without control over model parameters.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Inference-time methods such as Best-of-N (BON) sampling offer a simple yet effective alternative to improve performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.626</span></span>However, BON lacks iterative feedback integration mechanism.Hence, we propose Iterative Agent Decoding (IAD) which combines iterative refinement with dynamic candidate evaluation and selection guided by a verifier.IAD differs in how feedback is designed and integrated, specifically optimized to extract maximal signal from reward scores.We conduct a detailed comparison of baselines across key metrics on Sketch2Code, Text2SQL, and Webshop where IAD consistently outperforms baselines, achieving 3--6% absolute gains on Sketch2Code and Text2SQL (with and without LLM judges) and 8--10% gains on Webshop across multiple metrics.To better understand the source of IAD's gains, we perform controlled experiments to disentangle the effect of adaptive feedback from stochastic sampling, and find that IAD's improvements are primarily driven by verifier-guided refinement, not merely sampling diversity.We also show that both IAD and BON exhibit inference-time scaling with increased compute when guided by an optimal verifier.Our analysis highlights the critical role of verifier quality in effective inference-time optimization and examines the impact of noisy and sparse rewards on scaling behavior.Together, these findings offer key insights into the trade-offs and principles of effective inference-time optimization.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have achieved impressive results in real-time 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis.However, these methods struggle in large-scale, unconstrained environments where sparse and uneven input coverage, transient occlusions, appearance variability, and inconsistent camera settings lead to degraded quality.We propose GS-Diff, a novel 3DGS framework guided by a multi-view diffusion model to address these limitations.By generating pseudo-observations conditioned on multi-view inputs, our method transforms under-constrained 3D reconstruction problems into well-posed ones, enabling robust optimization even with sparse data.GS-Diff further integrates several enhancements, including appearance embedding, monocular depth priors, dynamic object modeling, anisotropy regularization, and advanced rasterization techniques, to tackle geometric and photometric challenges in real-world settings.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that GS-Diff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by significant margins. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.699</span></span></p>

                  <p>To reduce the human intervention in the preference measure process,this article proposes a preference collaborative measure framework based on an updated belief system,which is also capable of improving the accuracy and efficiency of preferen-ce measure algorithms.Firstly,the distance of rules and the average internal distance of rulesets are proposed for specifying the relationship between the rules.For discovering the most representative preferences that are common in all users,namely common preference,a algorithm based on average internal distance of ruleset,PRA algorithm,is proposed,which aims to finish the discoveryprocess with minimum information loss rate.Furthermore,the concept of Common belief is proposed to update the belief system,and the common preferences are the evidences of updated belief system.Then,under the belief system,the proposed belief degree and deviation degree are used to determine whether a rule confirms the belief system or not and classify the preference rules into two kinds(generalized or personalized),and eventually filters out Top-K interesting rules relying on belief degree and deviation degree.Based on above,a scalable interestingness calculation framework that can apply various formulas is proposed for accurately calculating interestingness in different conditions.At last,IMCos algorithm and IMCov algorithm are proposed as exemplars to verify the accuracy and efficiency of the framework by using weighted cosine similarity and correlation coefficients as belief degree.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In experiments,the proposed algorithms are compared to two state-of-the-art algorithms and the results show that IMCos and IMCov outperform than the other two in most aspects. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.636</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent advances in DUSt3R have enabled robust estimation of dense point clouds and camera parameters of static scenes, leveraging Transformer network architectures and direct supervision on large-scale 3D datasets.In contrast, the limited scale and diversity of available 4D datasets present a major bottleneck for training a highly generalizable 4D model.This constraint has driven conventional 4D methods to fine-tune 3D models on scalable dynamic video data with additional geometric priors such as optical flow and depths.In this work, we take an opposite path and introduce Easi3R, a simple yet efficient training-free method for 4D reconstruction.Our approach applies attention adaptation during inference, eliminating the need for from-scratch pre-training or network fine-tuning.We find that the attention layers in DUSt3R inherently encode rich information about camera and object motion.By carefully disentangling these attention maps, we achieve accurate dynamic region segmentation, camera pose estimation, and 4D dense point map reconstruction.Extensive experiments on real-world dynamic videos demonstrate that our lightweight attention adaptation significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods that are trained or finetuned on extensive dynamic datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code is publicly available for research purpose at https://easi3r.github.io/ <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span></p>

                  <p>Accurate segmentation of cell nuclei in histopathology images is essential for numerous biomedical research and clinical applications.However, existing cell nucleus segmentation methods only consider a single dataset (i.e., primary domain), while neglecting to leverage supplementary data from diverse sources (i.e., auxiliary domains) to reduce overfitting and enhance the performance.Although incorporating multiple datasets could alleviate overfitting, it often exacerbates performance drops caused by domain shifts.In this work, we introduce Adversarial Multi-domain Alignment of Segment Anything Model (AMA-SAM) that extends the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to overcome these obstacles through two key innovations.First, we propose a Conditional Gradient Reversal Layer (CGRL), a multi-domain alignment module that harmonizes features from diverse domains to promote domain-invariant representation learning while preserving crucial discriminative features for the primary dataset.Second, we address SAM's inherent low-resolution output by designing a High-Resolution Decoder (HR-Decoder), which directly produces fine-grained segmentation maps in order to capture intricate nuclei boundaries in high-resolution histology images.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to adapt SAM for multi-dataset learning with application to histology nuclei segmentation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We validate our method on several publicly available datasets, demonstrating consistent and significant improvements over state-of-the-art approaches. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.645</span></span></p>

                  <p>Evaluating text-to-image synthesis is challenging due to misalignment between established metrics and human preferences.We propose cFreD, a metric based on the notion of Conditional Fr\'echet Distance that explicitly accounts for both visual fidelity and text-prompt alignment.Existing metrics such as Inception Score (IS), Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) and CLIPScore assess either image quality or image-text alignment but not both which limits their correlation with human preferences.Scoring models explicitly trained to replicate human preferences require constant updates and may not generalize to novel generation techniques or out-of-domain inputs.Through extensive experiments across multiple recently proposed text-to-image models and diverse prompt datasets, we demonstrate that cFreD exhibits a higher correlation with human judgments compared to statistical metrics, including metrics trained with human preferences.Our findings validate cFreD as a robust, future-proof metric for the systematic evaluation of text-to-image models, standardizing benchmarking in this rapidly evolving field.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We release our evaluation toolkit and benchmark in the appendix. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span></p>

                  <p>Ensuring the reliability and effectiveness of software release decisions is critical, particularly in safety-critical domains like automotive systems.Precise analysis of release validation data, often presented in tabular form, plays a pivotal role in this process.However, traditional methods that rely on manual analysis of extensive test datasets and validation metrics are prone to delays and high costs.Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative but face challenges in analytical reasoning, contextual understanding, handling out-of-scope queries, and processing structured test data consistently; limitations that hinder their direct application in safety-critical scenarios.This paper introduces GateLens, an LLM-based tool for analyzing tabular data in the automotive domain.GateLens translates natural language queries into Relational Algebra (RA) expressions and then generates optimized Python code.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It outperforms the baseline system on benchmarking datasets, achieving higher F1 scores and handling complex and ambiguous queries with greater robustness. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span>Ablation studies confirm the critical role of the RA module, with performance dropping sharply when omitted.Industrial evaluations reveal that GateLens reduces analysis time by over 80% while maintaining high accuracy and reliability.As demonstrated by presented results, GateLens achieved high performance without relying on few-shot examples, showcasing strong generalization across various query types from diverse company roles.Insights from deploying GateLens with a partner automotive company offer practical guidance for integrating AI into critical workflows such as release validation.Results show that by automating test result analysis, GateLens enables faster, more informed, and dependable release decisions, and can thus advance software scalability and reliability in automotive systems.</p>

                  <p>This paper introduces a theoretical framework for a Transformer-augmented, sectional Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture that aims to enhance computational efficiency while preserving model scalability.Unlike conventional MoE models, which route entire token embeddings to selected experts, our approach portions the embedding dimension itself -- assigning segments of each token's representation to dedicated experts.To combat losses in token representation, we utilize a pre-expert transformer layer to recompute attention across tokens and reduce the sequence length dimensionality.We extend our theory by deriving optimal scaling laws that a non-linear relationship between the number of experts and factors such as model dimensionality, sequence length, and system overhead.These formulations yield closed-form and numerically-solvable expressions for identifying the optimal expert count under given architectural and hardware constraints.As a result, our framework not only provides theoretical bounds for computing efficiency with varying frameworks but also guides practical design choices for scaling large models effectively.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While empirical validation is pending, we present a comprehensive experimental road map to evaluate the framework's efficiency, scalability, and practicality in future work. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.667</span></span></p>

                  <p>Training deep neural networks (DNNs) is a structured optimization problem, because the parameters are naturally represented by matrices and tensors rather than simple vectors.Under this structural representation, it has been widely observed that gradients are low-rank and Hessians are approximately block-wise diagonal.These structured properties are crucial for designing efficient optimization algorithms but may not be utilized by current popular optimizers like Adam.In this paper, we present a novel optimization algorithm ASGO that capitalizes on these properties by employing a preconditioner that is adaptively updated using structured gradients.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By fine-grained theoretical analysis, ASGO is proven to achieve superior convergence rates compared to existing structured gradient methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.612</span></span>Based on the convergence theory, we further demonstrate that ASGO can benefit from the low-rank and block-wise diagonal properties.We also discuss practical modifications of ASGO and empirically verify the effectiveness of the algorithm on language model tasks.</p>

Given a target coverage parameter $\delta$, and sample access to an arbitrary distribution $D$, we want to output a confidence set $S \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ such that $S$ achieves $\delta$ coverage of $D$, i.e., $\mathbb{P}_{y \sim D} \left<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>[ y \in S \right] \ge \delta$, and the volume of $S$ is as small as possible. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.611</span></span>This is a central problem in high-dimensional statistics with applications in finding confidence sets, uncertainty quantification, and support estimation.   In the most general setting, this problem is statistically intractable, so we restrict our attention to competing with sets from a concept class $C$ with bounded VC-dimension.An algorithm is competitive with class $C$ if, given samples from an arbitrary distribution $D$, it outputs in polynomial time a set that achieves $\delta$ coverage of $D$, and whose volume is competitive with the smallest set in $C$ with the required coverage $\delta$.This problem is computationally challenging even in the basic setting when $C$ is the set of all Euclidean balls.Existing algorithms based on coresets find in polynomial time a ball whose volume is $\exp(\tilde{O}( d/ \log d))$-factor competitive with the volume of the best ball.   Our main result is an algorithm that finds a confidence set whose volume is $\exp(\tilde{O}(d^{2/3}))$ factor competitive with the optimal ball having the desired coverage.The algorithm is improper (it outputs an ellipsoid).Combined with our computational intractability result for proper learning balls within an $\exp(\tilde{O}(d^{1-o(1)}))$ approximation factor in volume, our results provide an interesting separation between proper and (improper) learning of confidence sets.</p>
