                  <p>Learning effective deep portrait matting models requires training data of both high quality and large quantity.Neither quality nor quantity can be easily met for portrait matting, however.Since the most accurate ground-truth portrait mattes are acquired in front of the green screen, it is almost impossible to harvest a large-scale portrait matting dataset in reality.This work shows that one can leverage text prompts and the recent Layer Diffusion model to generate high-quality portrait foregrounds and extract latent portrait mattes.However, the portrait mattes cannot be readily in use due to significant generation artifacts.Inspired by the connectivity priors observed in portrait images, that is, the border of portrait foregrounds always appears connected, a connectivity-aware approach is introduced to refine portrait mattes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Building on this, a large-scale portrait matting dataset is created, termed LD-Portrait-20K, with $20,051$ portrait foregrounds and high-quality alpha mattes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.926</span></span>Extensive experiments demonstrated the value of the LD-Portrait-20K dataset, with models trained on it significantly outperforming those trained on other datasets.In addition, comparisons with the chroma keying algorithm and an ablation study on dataset capacity further confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed matte creation approach.Further, the dataset also contributes to state-of-the-art video portrait matting, implemented by simple video segmentation and a trimap-based image matting model trained on this dataset.</p>

                  <p>Fixing Python dependency issues is a tedious and error-prone task for developers, who must manually identify and resolve environment dependencies and version constraints of third-party modules and Python interpreters.Researchers have attempted to automate this process by relying on large knowledge graphs and database lookup tables.However, these traditional approaches face limitations due to the variety of dependency error types, large sets of possible module versions, and conflicts among transitive dependencies.This study explores the potential of using large language models (LLMs) to automatically fix dependency issues in Python programs.We introduce PLLM (pronounced "plum"), a novel technique that employs retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to help an LLM infer Python versions and required modules for a given Python file.PLLM builds a testing environment that iteratively (1) prompts the LLM for module combinations, (2) tests the suggested changes, and (3) provides feedback (error messages) to the LLM to refine the fix.This feedback cycle leverages natural language processing (NLP) to intelligently parse and interpret build error messages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We benchmark PLLM on the Gistable HG2.9K dataset, a collection of challenging single-file Python gists. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.781</span></span>We compare PLLM against two state-of-the-art automatic dependency inference approaches, namely PyEGo and ReadPyE, w.r.t.the ability to resolve dependency issues.Our results indicate that PLLM can fix more dependency issues than the two baselines, with +218 (+15.97%) more fixes over ReadPyE and +281 (+21.58%) over PyEGo.Our deeper analyses suggest that PLLM is particularly beneficial for projects with many dependencies and for specific third-party numerical and machine-learning modules.Our findings demonstrate the potential of LLM-based approaches to iteratively resolve Python dependency issues.</p>

                  <p>The research in AI-based formal mathematical reasoning has shown an unstoppable growth trend.These studies have excelled in mathematical competitions like IMO, showing significant progress.However, these studies intertwined multiple skills simultaneously, i.e., problem-solving, reasoning, and writing formal specifications, making it hard to precisely identify the LLMs' strengths and weaknesses in each task.This paper focuses on formal verification, an immediate application scenario of formal reasoning, and decomposes it into six sub-tasks.We constructed 18k high-quality instruction-response pairs across five mainstream formal specification languages (Coq, Lean4, Dafny, ACSL, and TLA+) in six formal-verification-related tasks by distilling GPT-4o.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>They are split into a 14k+ fine-tuning dataset FM-alpaca and a 4k benchmark FM-Bench. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.761</span></span>We found that LLMs are good at writing proof segments when given either the code, or the detailed description of proof steps.Also, the fine-tuning brought about a nearly threefold improvement at most.Interestingly, we observed that fine-tuning with formal data also enhances mathematics, reasoning, and coding abilities.We hope our findings inspire further research.Fine-tuned models are released to facilitate subsequent studies</p>

                  <p>Most social media users come from non-English speaking countries in the Global South.Despite the widespread prevalence of harmful content in these regions, current moderation systems repeatedly struggle in low-resource languages spoken there.In this work, we examine the challenges AI researchers and practitioners face when building moderation tools for low-resource languages.We conducted semi-structured interviews with 22 AI researchers and practitioners specializing in automatic detection of harmful content in four diverse low-resource languages from the Global South.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These are: Tamil from South Asia, Swahili from East Africa, Maghrebi Arabic from North Africa, and Quechua from South America. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.782</span></span>Our findings reveal that social media companies' restrictions on researchers' access to data exacerbate the historical marginalization of these languages, which have long lacked datasets for studying online harms.Moreover, common preprocessing techniques and language models, predominantly designed for data-rich English, fail to account for the linguistic complexity of low-resource languages.This leads to critical errors when moderating content in Tamil, Swahili, Arabic, and Quechua, which are morphologically richer than English.Based on our findings, we establish that the precarities in current moderation pipelines are rooted in deep systemic inequities and continue to reinforce historical power imbalances.We conclude by discussing multi-stakeholder approaches to improve moderation for low-resource languages.</p>

                  <p>Lower-Limb Fractures (LLF) are a major health concern for older adults, often leading to reduced mobility and prolonged recovery, potentially impairing daily activities and independence.During recovery, older adults frequently face social isolation and functional decline, complicating rehabilitation and adversely affecting physical and mental health.Multi-modal sensor platforms that continuously collect data and analyze it using machine-learning algorithms can remotely monitor this population and infer health outcomes.They can also alert clinicians to individuals at risk of isolation and decline.This paper presents a new publicly available multi-modal sensor dataset, MAISON-LLF, collected from older adults recovering from LLF in community settings.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset includes data from smartphone and smartwatch sensors, motion detectors, sleep-tracking mattresses, and clinical questionnaires on isolation and decline. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.907</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset was collected from ten older adults living alone at home for eight weeks each, totaling 560 days of 24-hour sensor data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.748</span></span>For technical validation, supervised machine-learning and deep-learning models were developed using the sensor and clinical questionnaire data, providing a foundational comparison for the research community.</p>

                  <p>Recent advances in large multimodal models (LMMs) have recognized fine-grained grounding as an imperative factor of visual understanding and dialogue.However, the benefits of such representation in LMMs are limited to the natural image domain, and these models perform poorly for remote sensing (RS).The distinct overhead viewpoint, scale variation, and presence of small objects in high-resolution RS imagery present a unique challenge in region-level comprehension.Moreover, the development of the grounding conversation capability of LMMs within RS is hindered by the lack of granular, RS domain-specific grounded data.Addressing these limitations, we propose GeoPixel - the first end-to-end high resolution RS-LMM that supports pixel-level grounding.This capability allows fine-grained visual perception by generating interleaved masks in conversation.GeoPixel supports up to 4K HD resolution in any aspect ratio, ideal for high-precision RS image analysis.To support the grounded conversation generation (GCG) in RS imagery, we curate a visually grounded dataset GeoPixelD through a semi-automated pipeline that utilizes set-of-marks prompting and spatial priors tailored for RS data to methodically control the data generation process.GeoPixel demonstrates superior performance in pixel-level comprehension, surpassing existing LMMs in both single-target and multi-target segmentation tasks.Our methodological ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each component in the overall architecture.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and data will be publicly released. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.826</span></span></p>

                  <p>Identifying anatomical landmarks in 3D dental models is crucial for orthodontic treatment.Manually placing these key points is complex, time-consuming, and requires expert knowledge.While some machine learning methods have been proposed for automatic tooth landmark detection in 3D Intraoral Scans (IOS), research remains limited, with no fully end-to-end approaches that avoid teeth segmentation.   We propose CHaRNet (Conditioned Heatmap Regression Network), the first end-to-end deep learning method for tooth landmark detection in 3D IOS.Unlike traditional two-stage methods that segment teeth before detecting landmarks, CHaRNet directly detects landmarks on the input point cloud.It consists of four key modules: (1) a point cloud encoder, (2) a point cloud decoder with a heatmap regression head, (3) a teeth presence classification head, and (4) the innovative Conditioned Heatmap Regression (CHaR) module.The CHaR module refines landmark regression by leveraging teeth presence classification, enabling dynamic adaptation to cases with missing teeth and improving accuracy in complex dental models.   We evaluate CHaRNet using five point cloud learning algorithms to validate the effectiveness of the CHaR module and test it on a clinical dataset of $1,214$ annotated 3D dental models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Both the dataset and code will be publicly released to address the lack of open datasets in orthodontics, promote benchmarking, and inspire new research.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.712</span></span>CHaRNet achieves a Mean Euclidean Distance Error (MEDE) of 1.28 mm and a Mean Success Ratio (MSR) of 82.40\%, demonstrating robust performance.Notably, it excels in handling irregular dental geometries, such as models with missing teeth.This end-to-end approach streamlines orthodontic workflows, improves 3D IOS analysis precision, and facilitates efficient computer-assisted treatment planning.</p>

                  <p>In this paper, we propose VideoLLaMA3, a more advanced multimodal foundation model for image and video understanding.The core design philosophy of VideoLLaMA3 is vision-centric.The meaning of "vision-centric" is two-fold: the vision-centric training paradigm and vision-centric framework design.The key insight of our vision-centric training paradigm is that high-quality image-text data is crucial for both image and video understanding.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Instead of preparing massive video-text datasets, we focus on constructing large-scale and high-quality image-text datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.768</span></span>VideoLLaMA3 has four training stages: 1) vision-centric alignment stage, which warms up the vision encoder and projector; 2) vision-language pretraining stage, which jointly tunes the vision encoder, projector, and LLM with large-scale image-text data covering multiple types (including scene images, documents, charts) as well as text-only data.3) multi-task fine-tuning stage, which incorporates image-text SFT data for downstream tasks and video-text data to establish a foundation for video understanding.4) video-centric fine-tuning, which further improves the model's capability in video understanding.As for the framework design, to better capture fine-grained details in images, the pretrained vision encoder is adapted to encode images of varying sizes into vision tokens with corresponding numbers, rather than a fixed number of tokens.For video inputs, we reduce the number of vision tokens according to their similarity so that the representation of videos will be more precise and compact.Benefit from vision-centric designs, VideoLLaMA3 achieves compelling performances in both image and video understanding benchmarks.</p>

                  <p>Purpose: Surgical workflow analysis is crucial for improving surgical efficiency and safety.However, previous studies rely heavily on large-scale annotated datasets, posing challenges in cost, scalability, and reliance on expert annotations.To address this, we propose Surg-FTDA (Few-shot Text-driven Adaptation), designed to handle various surgical workflow analysis tasks with minimal paired image-label data.   Methods: Our approach has two key components.First, Few-shot selection-based modality alignment selects a small subset of images and aligns their embeddings with text embeddings from the downstream task, bridging the modality gap.Second, Text-driven adaptation leverages only text data to train a decoder, eliminating the need for paired image-text data.This decoder is then applied to aligned image embeddings, enabling image-related tasks without explicit image-text pairs.   Results: We evaluate our approach to generative tasks (image captioning) and discriminative tasks (triplet recognition and phase recognition).Results show that Surg-FTDA outperforms baselines and generalizes well across downstream tasks.   Conclusion: We propose a text-driven adaptation approach that mitigates the modality gap and handles multiple downstream tasks in surgical workflow analysis, with minimal reliance on large annotated datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code and dataset will be released in https://github.com/TingxuanSix/Surg-FTDA. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.85</span></span></p>

                  <p>Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals have emerged as a promising modality for biometric identification.While previous studies have explored the use of imagined speech with semantically meaningful words for subject identification, most have relied on additional visual or auditory cues.In this study, we introduce a cueless EEG-based imagined speech paradigm, where subjects imagine the pronunciation of semantically meaningful words without any external cues.This innovative approach addresses the limitations of prior methods by requiring subjects to select and imagine words from a predefined list naturally.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset comprises over 4,350 trials from 11 subjects across five sessions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.775</span></span>We assess a variety of classification methods, including traditional machine learning techniques such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and XGBoost, as well as time-series foundation models and deep learning architectures specifically designed for EEG classification, such as EEG Conformer and Shallow ConvNet.A session-based hold-out validation strategy was employed to ensure reliable evaluation and prevent data leakage.Our results demonstrate outstanding classification accuracy, reaching 97.93%.These findings highlight the potential of cueless EEG paradigms for secure and reliable subject identification in real-world applications, such as brain-computer interfaces (BCIs).</p>

                  <p>Our work addresses the problem of stochastic long-term dense anticipation.The goal of this task is to predict actions and their durations several minutes into the future based on provided video observations.Anticipation over extended horizons introduces high uncertainty, as a single observation can lead to multiple plausible future outcomes.To address this uncertainty, stochastic models are designed to predict several potential future action sequences.Recent work has further proposed to incorporate uncertainty modelling for observed frames by simultaneously predicting per-frame past and future actions in a unified manner.While such joint modelling of actions is beneficial, it requires long-range temporal capabilities to connect events across distant past and future time points.However, the previous work struggles to achieve such a long-range understanding due to its limited and/or sparse receptive field.To alleviate this issue, we propose a novel MANTA (MAmba for ANTicipation) network.Our model enables effective long-term temporal modelling even for very long sequences while maintaining linear complexity in sequence length.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on three datasets - Breakfast, 50Salads, and Assembly101 - while also significantly improving computational and memory efficiency. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.847</span></span></p>

                  <p>The $r$-neighbourhood complexity of a graph $G$ is the function counting, for a given integer $k$, the largest possible number, over all vertex-subsets $A$ of size $k$, of subsets of $A$ realized as the intersection between the $r$-neighbourhood of some vertex and $A$.A refinement of this notion is the $r$-profile complexity, that counts the maximum number of distinct distance-vectors from any vertex to the vertices of $A$, ignoring distances larger than $r$. Typically, in structured graph classes such as graphs of bounded VC-dimension or chordal graphs, these functions are bounded, leading to insights into their structural properties and efficient algorithms.   We improve existing bounds on the $r$-profile complexity (and thus on the $r$-neighbourhood complexity) for graphs in several structured graph classes.We show that the $r$-profile complexity of graphs excluding $K_h$ as a minor is in $O_h(r^{3h-3}k)$. For graphs of treewidth at most $t$ we give a bound in $O_t(r^{t+1}k)$, which is tight up to a function of $t$ as a factor.These bounds improve results and answer a question of Joret and Rambaud<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>[Combinatorica, 2024].    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.702</span></span>For outerplanar graphs, we can improve our treewidth bound by a factor of $r$ and conjecture that a similar improvement holds for graphs with bounded simple treewidth.For graphs of treelength at most $\ell$, we give the upper bound in $O(k(r^2(\ell+1)^k))$.   Our bounds also imply relations between the order, diameter and metric dimension of graphs in these classes, improving results from [Beaudou et al., SIDMA 2017].</p>

                  <p>Localizing text descriptions in large-scale 3D scenes is inherently an ambiguous task.This nonetheless arises while describing general concepts, e.g. all traffic lights in a city.   To facilitate reasoning based on such concepts, text localization in the form of distribution is required.In this paper, we generate the distribution of the camera poses conditioned upon the textual description.   To facilitate such generation, we propose a diffusion-based architecture that conditionally diffuses the noisy 6DoF camera poses to their plausible locations.   The conditional signals are derived from the text descriptions, using the pre-trained text encoders.The connection between text descriptions and pose distribution is established through pretrained Vision-Language-Model, i.e. CLIP.Furthermore, we demonstrate that the candidate poses for the distribution can be further refined by rendering potential poses using 3D Gaussian splatting, guiding incorrectly posed samples towards locations that better align with the textual description, through visual reasoning.   We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by comparing it with both standard retrieval methods and learning-based approaches.Our proposed method consistently outperforms these baselines across all five large-scale datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our source code and dataset will be made publicly available. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.927</span></span></p>

                  <p>3D scene generation has garnered growing attention in recent years and has made significant progress.Generating 4D cities is more challenging than 3D scenes due to the presence of structurally complex, visually diverse objects like buildings and vehicles, and heightened human sensitivity to distortions in urban environments.To tackle these issues, we propose CityDreamer4D, a compositional generative model specifically tailored for generating unbounded 4D cities.Our main insights are 1) 4D city generation should separate dynamic objects (e.g., vehicles) from static scenes (e.g., buildings and roads), and 2) all objects in the 4D scene should be composed of different types of neural fields for buildings, vehicles, and background stuff.Specifically, we propose Traffic Scenario Generator and Unbounded Layout Generator to produce dynamic traffic scenarios and static city layouts using a highly compact BEV representation.Objects in 4D cities are generated by combining stuff-oriented and instance-oriented neural fields for background stuff, buildings, and vehicles.To suit the distinct characteristics of background stuff and instances, the neural fields employ customized generative hash grids and periodic positional embeddings as scene parameterizations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we offer a comprehensive suite of datasets for city generation, including OSM, GoogleEarth, and CityTopia. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.866</span></span>The OSM dataset provides a variety of real-world city layouts, while the Google Earth and CityTopia datasets deliver large-scale, high-quality city imagery complete with 3D instance annotations.Leveraging its compositional design, CityDreamer4D supports a range of downstream applications, such as instance editing, city stylization, and urban simulation, while delivering state-of-the-art performance in generating realistic 4D cities.</p>

                  <p>Source camera identification has emerged as a vital solution to unlock incidents involving critical cases like terrorism, violence, and other criminal activities.The ability to trace the origin of an image/video can aid law enforcement agencies in gathering evidence and constructing the timeline of events.Moreover, identifying the owner of a certain device narrows down the area of search in a criminal investigation where smartphone devices are involved.This paper proposes a new pixel-based method for source camera identification, integrating Pixel Difference Convolution (PDC) with a Vision Transformer network (ViT), and named PDC-ViT.While the PDC acts as the backbone for feature extraction by exploiting Angular PDC (APDC) and Radial PDC (RPDC).These techniques enhance the capability to capture subtle variations in pixel information, which are crucial for distinguishing between different source cameras.The second part of the methodology focuses on classification, which is based on a Vision Transformer network.Unlike traditional methods that utilize image patches directly for training the classification network, the proposed approach uniquely inputs PDC features into the Vision Transformer network.To demonstrate the effectiveness of the PDC-ViT approach, it has been assessed on five different datasets, which include various image contents and video scenes.The method has also been compared with state-of-the-art source camera identification methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed system in terms of accuracy and robustness when compared to its competitors. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.675</span></span>For example, our proposed PDC-ViT has achieved an accuracy of 94.30%, 84%, 94.22% and 92.29% using the Vision dataset, Daxing dataset, Socrates dataset and QUFVD dataset, respectively.</p>

We fill this gap in the literature by conducting a formal runtime analysis of the cGA on LeadingOnes.For the cGA's single parameter -- called the hypothetical population size -- at least polylogarithmically larger than the problem size, we prove that the cGA samples the optimum of LeadingOnes with high probability within a number of function evaluations quasi-linear in the problem size and linear in the hypothetical population size.For the best hypothetical population size, our result matches, up to polylogarithmic factors, the typical quadratic runtime that many randomized search heuristics exhibit on LeadingOnes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our analysis exhibits some noteworthy differences in the working principles of the two algorithms which were not visible in previous works. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.691</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) provide powerful foundations to perform fine-grained text re-ranking.However, they are often prohibitive in reality due to constraints on computation bandwidth.In this work, we propose a \textbf{flexible} architecture called \textbf{Matroyshka Re-Ranker}, which is designed to facilitate \textbf{runtime customization} of model layers and sequence lengths at each layer based on users' configurations.Consequently, the LLM-based re-rankers can be made applicable across various real-world situations.The increased flexibility may come at the cost of precision loss.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this problem, we introduce a suite of techniques to optimize the performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.665</span></span>First, we propose \textbf{cascaded self-distillation}, where each sub-architecture learns to preserve a precise re-ranking performance from its super components, whose predictions can be exploited as smooth and informative teacher signals.Second, we design a \textbf{factorized compensation mechanism}, where two collaborative Low-Rank Adaptation modules, vertical and horizontal, are jointly employed to compensate for the precision loss resulted from arbitrary combinations of layer and sequence compression.We perform comprehensive experiments based on the passage and document retrieval datasets from MSMARCO, along with all public datasets from BEIR benchmark.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In our experiments, Matryoshka Re-Ranker substantially outperforms the existing methods, while effectively preserving its superior performance across various forms of compression and different application scenarios. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.66</span></span></p>

                  <p>Graph computational tasks are inherently challenging and often demand the development of advanced algorithms for effective solutions.With the emergence of large language models (LLMs), researchers have begun investigating their potential to address these tasks.However, existing approaches are constrained by LLMs' limited capability to comprehend complex graph structures and their high inference costs, rendering them impractical for handling large-scale graphs.Inspired by human approaches to graph problems, we introduce a novel framework, PIE (Pseudocode-Injection-Enhanced LLM Reasoning for Graph Computational Tasks), which consists of three key steps: problem understanding, prompt design, and code generation.In this framework, LLMs are tasked with understanding the problem and extracting relevant information to generate correct code.The responsibility for analyzing the graph structure and executing the code is delegated to the interpreter.We inject task-related pseudocodes into the prompts to further assist the LLMs in generating efficient code.We also employ cost-effective trial-and-error techniques to ensure that the LLM-generated code executes correctly.Unlike other methods that require invoking LLMs for each individual test case, PIE only calls the LLM during the code generation phase, allowing the generated code to be reused and significantly reducing inference costs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments demonstrate that PIE outperforms existing baselines in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.649</span></span></p>

                  <p>Although large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong text generation capabilities, they struggle in scenarios requiring access to structured knowledge bases or specific documents, limiting their effectiveness in knowledge-intensive tasks.To address this limitation, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) models have been developed, enabling generative models to incorporate relevant document fragments into their inputs.In this paper, we design and evaluate a RAG-based virtual assistant specifically tailored for the University of S\~ao Paulo.Our system architecture comprises two key modules: a retriever and a generative model.We experiment with different types of models for both components, adjusting hyperparameters such as chunk size and the number of retrieved documents.Our optimal retriever model achieves a Top-5 accuracy of 30%, while our most effective generative model scores 22.04\% against ground truth answers.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Notably, when the correct document chunks are supplied to the LLMs, accuracy significantly improves to 54.02%, an increase of over 30 percentage points. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.611</span></span>Conversely, without contextual input, performance declines to 13.68%.These findings highlight the critical role of database access in enhancing LLM performance.They also reveal the limitations of current semantic search methods in accurately identifying relevant documents and underscore the ongoing challenges LLMs face in generating precise responses.</p>

                  <p>Multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) are pivotal in revolutionizing customer support and operations by integrating multiple modalities such as text, images, and audio.Federated Prompt Learning (FPL) is a recently proposed approach that combines pre-trained multimodal LLMs such as vision-language models with federated learning to create personalized, privacy-preserving AI systems.However, balancing the competing goals of personalization, generalization, and privacy remains a significant challenge.Over-personalization can lead to overfitting, reducing generalizability, while stringent privacy measures, such as differential privacy, can hinder both personalization and generalization.In this paper, we propose a Differentially Private Federated Prompt Learning (DP-FPL) approach to tackle this challenge by leveraging a low-rank adaptation scheme to capture generalization while maintaining a residual term that preserves expressiveness for personalization.To ensure privacy, we introduce a novel method where we apply local differential privacy to the two low-rank components of the local prompt, and global differential privacy to the global prompt.Our approach mitigates the impact of privacy noise on the model performance while balancing the tradeoff between personalization and generalization.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach over other benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.808</span></span></p>

That is, strong polarization continues to hold under the min-sum approximation.Conversely, for code rates exceeding $R_{\mathrm{U}}$, the error probability approaches $1$ as the code-length increases, irrespective of which bits are frozen.We show that $0 < R_{\mathrm{L}} \leq R_{\mathrm{U}} \leq C$, where $C$ is the channel capacity.The last inequality is often strict, in which case the ramification of using the min-sum approximation is that we can no longer achieve capacity.</p>

                  <p>Time series forecasting plays a pivotal role in a wide range of applications, including weather prediction, healthcare, structural health monitoring, predictive maintenance, energy systems, and financial markets.While models such as LSTM, GRU, Transformers, and State-Space Models (SSMs) have become standard tools in this domain, selecting the optimal architecture remains a challenge.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Performance comparisons often depend on evaluation metrics and the datasets under analysis, making the choice of a universally optimal model controversial. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.692</span></span>In this work, we introduce a flexible automated framework for time series forecasting that systematically designs and evaluates diverse network architectures by integrating LSTM, GRU, multi-head Attention, and SSM blocks.Using a multi-objective optimization approach, our framework determines the number, sequence, and combination of blocks to align with specific requirements and evaluation objectives.From the resulting Pareto-optimal architectures, the best model for a given context is selected via a user-defined preference function.We validate our framework across four distinct real-world applications.Results show that a single-layer GRU or LSTM is usually optimal when minimizing training time alone.However, when maximizing accuracy or balancing multiple objectives, the best architectures are often composite designs incorporating multiple block types in specific configurations.By employing a weighted preference function, users can resolve trade-offs between objectives, revealing novel, context-specific optimal architectures.Our findings underscore that no single neural architecture is universally optimal for time series forecasting.Instead, the best-performing model emerges as a data-driven composite architecture tailored to user-defined criteria and evaluation objectives.</p>

                  <p>Low-light image enhancement (LLE) aims to improve the visual quality of images captured in poorly lit conditions, which often suffer from low brightness, low contrast, noise, and color distortions.These issues hinder the performance of computer vision tasks such as object detection, facial recognition, and autonomous driving.Traditional enhancement techniques, such as multi-scale fusion and histogram equalization, fail to preserve fine details and often struggle with maintaining the natural appearance of enhanced images under complex lighting conditions.Although the Retinex theory provides a foundation for image decomposition, it often amplifies noise, leading to suboptimal image quality.In this paper, we propose the Dual Light Enhance Network (DLEN), a novel architecture that incorporates two distinct attention mechanisms, considering both spatial and frequency domains.Our model introduces a learnable wavelet transform module in the illumination estimation phase, preserving high- and low-frequency components to enhance edge and texture details.Additionally, we design a dual-branch structure that leverages the power of the Transformer architecture to enhance both the illumination and structural components of the image.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through extensive experiments, our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on standard benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.783</span></span>Code is available here: https://github.com/LaLaLoXX/DLEN</p>

                  <p>Renewable energy is crucial for addressing the growing energy demands of modern society while mitigating the adverse effects of climate change.Unlike fossil fuels, renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, and biomass are abundant, sustainable, and environmentally friendly.This study focuses on addressing a critical challenge in renewable energy decision-making by developing a novel framework for optimal solar panel selection, a key component of sustainable energy solutions.Solar panel selection involves evaluating multiple interdependent criteria, such as efficiency, cost, durability, and environmental impact.Traditional multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods often fail to account for the interdependencies among these criteria, leading to suboptimal outcomes.To overcome this limitation, the study introduces the Choquet Aggregated Sum Product Assessment (CASPAS) method, a Choquet integral-based MCDM approach that incorporates fuzzy measures to model interactions among criteria.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>CASPAS generalizes the Weighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment (WASPAS) method, thereby enhancing decision-making accuracy and reliability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.607</span></span>This study also introduces the concept of disc intuitionistic fuzzy set (D-IFS), a generalization of the concept of circular intuitionistic fuzzy set, which employ a radius function capable of assigning varying values to individual elements instead of relying on a fixed radius.Recognizing that traditional weighted aggregation operators neglect the interaction among criteria, this study proposes disc intuitionistic fuzzy Choquet integral operators by incorporating the concept of fuzzy measures, which are effective in modeling such interactions.The proposed method is applied to a renewable energy problem on selecting optimal solar panels.</p>

                  <p>We introduce MMVU, a comprehensive expert-level, multi-discipline benchmark for evaluating foundation models in video understanding.MMVU includes 3,000 expert-annotated questions spanning 27 subjects across four core disciplines: Science, Healthcare, Humanities & Social Sciences, and Engineering.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Compared to prior benchmarks, MMVU features three key advancements. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span>First, it challenges models to apply domain-specific knowledge and perform expert-level reasoning to analyze specialized-domain videos, moving beyond the basic visual perception typically assessed in current video benchmarks.Second, each example is annotated by human experts from scratch.We implement strict data quality controls to ensure the high quality of the dataset.Finally, each example is enriched with expert-annotated reasoning rationals and relevant domain knowledge, facilitating in-depth analysis.We conduct an extensive evaluation of 32 frontier multimodal foundation models on MMVU.The latest System-2-capable models, o1 and Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking, achieve the highest performance among the tested models.However, they still fall short of matching human expertise.Through in-depth error analyses and case studies, we offer actionable insights for future advancements in expert-level, knowledge-intensive video understanding for specialized domains.</p>

                  <p>Query scheduling is a critical task that directly impacts query performance in database management systems (DBMS).Deeply integrated schedulers, which require changes to DBMS internals, are usually customized for a specific engine and can take months to implement.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In contrast, non-intrusive schedulers make coarse-grained decisions, such as controlling query admission and re-ordering query execution, without requiring modifications to DBMS internals. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>They require much less engineering effort and can be applied across a wide range of DBMS engines, offering immediate benefits to end users. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span>However, most existing non-intrusive scheduling systems rely on simplified cost models and heuristics that cannot accurately model query interactions under concurrency and different system states, possibly leading to suboptimal scheduling decisions.   This work introduces IconqSched, a new, principled non-intrusive scheduler that optimizes the execution order and timing of queries to enhance total end-to-end runtime as experienced by the user query queuing time plus system runtime.Unlike previous approaches, IconqSched features a novel fine-grained predictor, Iconq, which treats the DBMS as a black box and accurately estimates the system runtime of concurrently executed queries under different system states.Using these predictions, IconqSched is able to capture system runtime variations across different query mixes and system loads.It then employs a greedy scheduling algorithm to effectively determine which queries to submit and when to submit them.We compare IconqSched to other schedulers in terms of end-to-end runtime using real workload traces.On Postgres, IconqSched reduces end-to-end runtime by 16.2%-28.2% on average and 33.6%-38.9% in the tail.Similarly, on Redshift, it reduces end-to-end runtime by 10.3%-14.1% on average and 14.9%-22.2% in the tail.</p>

                  <p>Software verification is a complex problem, and verification tools need significant tuning to achieve high performance.Due to this, many verifiers choose to specialize on reachability properties, or invest the time to implement known transformations from the given specification to reachability on their internal representations.To improve this situation, we provide transformations as stand-alone components, modifying the input program instead of the internal representation, enabling their usage as a preprocessing step by other verifiers.This way, we separate two concerns: improving the performance of reachability analyses and implementing efficient transformations of arbitrary specifications to reachability.We implement the transformations in a framework that is based on instrumentation automata, inspired by the BLAST query language.In our initial study, we support three important concrete specifications for C programs: termination, no-overflow, and memory cleanup.Moreover, we discuss the broader expressiveness of our framework and show how general liveness properties can be transformed to reachability.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our transformations by comparing verifiers that support the specifications natively with verifiers for reachability applied on the transformed programs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span>The results are very promising: Our transformations can extend existing verifiers to be effective on specifications that they do not support natively, and that the efficiency is often similar to verifiers that natively support the considered specifications.</p>
