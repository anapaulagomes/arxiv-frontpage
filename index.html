                  <p>Multimodal foundation models serve numerous applications at the intersection of vision and language.Still, despite being pretrained on extensive data, they become outdated over time.To keep models updated, research into continual pretraining mainly explores scenarios with either (1) infrequent, indiscriminate updates on large-scale new data, or (2) frequent, sample-level updates.However, practical model deployment often operates in the gap between these two limit cases, as real-world applications often demand adaptation to specific subdomains, tasks or concepts -- spread over the entire, varying life cycle of a model.In this work, we complement current perspectives on continual pretraining through a research test bed as well as provide comprehensive guidance for effective continual model updates in such scenarios.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We first introduce FoMo-in-Flux, a continual multimodal pretraining benchmark with realistic compute constraints and practical deployment requirements, constructed over 63 datasets with diverse visual and semantic coverage. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.775</span></span>Using FoMo-in-Flux, we explore the complex landscape of practical continual pretraining through multiple perspectives: (1) A data-centric investigation of data mixtures and stream orderings that emulate real-world deployment situations, (2) a method-centric investigation ranging from simple fine-tuning and traditional continual learning strategies to parameter-efficient updates and model merging, (3) meta learning rate schedules and mechanistic design choices, and (4) the influence of model and compute scaling.Together, our insights provide a practitioner's guide to continual multimodal pretraining for real-world deployment.Our benchmark and code is here: https://github.com/ExplainableML/fomo_in_flux.</p>

                  <p>The human brain has an inherent ability to fill in gaps to perceive figures as complete wholes, even when parts are missing or fragmented.This phenomenon is known as Closure in psychology, one of the Gestalt laws of perceptual organization, explaining how the human brain interprets visual stimuli.Given the importance of Closure for human object recognition, we investigate whether neural networks rely on a similar mechanism.Exploring this crucial human visual skill in neural networks has the potential to highlight their comparability to humans.Recent studies have examined the Closure effect in neural networks.However, they typically focus on a limited selection of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and have not reached a consensus on their capability to perform Closure.To address these gaps, we present a systematic framework for investigating the Closure principle in neural networks.We introduce well-curated datasets designed to test for Closure effects, including both modal and amodal completion.We then conduct experiments on various CNNs employing different measurements.Our comprehensive analysis reveals that VGG16 and DenseNet-121 exhibit the Closure effect, while other CNNs show variable results.We interpret these findings by blending insights from psychology and neural network research, offering a unique perspective that enhances transparency in understanding neural networks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and dataset will be made available on GitHub. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.913</span></span></p>

                  <p>In this work, we introduce Scribbles for All, a label and training data generation algorithm for semantic segmentation trained on scribble labels.Training or fine-tuning semantic segmentation models with weak supervision has become an important topic recently and was subject to significant advances in model quality.In this setting, scribbles are a promising label type to achieve high quality segmentation results while requiring a much lower annotation effort than usual pixel-wise dense semantic segmentation annotations.The main limitation of scribbles as source for weak supervision is the lack of challenging datasets for scribble segmentation, which hinders the development of novel methods and conclusive evaluations.To overcome this limitation, Scribbles for All provides scribble labels for several popular segmentation datasets and provides an algorithm to automatically generate scribble labels for any dataset with dense annotations, paving the way for new insights and model advancements in the field of weakly supervised segmentation.In addition to providing datasets and algorithm, we evaluate state-of-the-art segmentation models on our datasets and show that models trained with our synthetic labels perform competitively with respect to models trained on manual labels.Thus, our datasets enable state-of-the-art research into methods for scribble-labeled semantic segmentation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The datasets, scribble generation algorithm, and baselines are publicly available at https://github.com/wbkit/Scribbles4All <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.725</span></span></p>

                  <p>Anomaly detection is critical in surveillance systems and patrol robots by identifying anomalous regions in images for early warning.Depending on whether reference data are utilized, anomaly detection can be categorized into anomaly detection with reference and anomaly detection without reference.Currently, anomaly detection without reference, which is closely related to out-of-distribution (OoD) object detection, struggles with learning anomalous patterns due to the difficulty of collecting sufficiently large and diverse anomaly datasets with the inherent rarity and novelty of anomalies.Alternatively, anomaly detection with reference employs the scheme of change detection to identify anomalies by comparing semantic changes between a reference image and a query one.However, there are very few ADr works due to the scarcity of public datasets in this domain.In this paper, we aim to address this gap by introducing the UMAD Benchmark Dataset.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To our best knowledge, this is the first benchmark dataset designed specifically for anomaly detection with reference in robotic patrolling scenarios, e.g., where an autonomous robot is employed to detect anomalous objects by comparing a reference and a query video sequences. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.788</span></span>The reference sequences can be taken by the robot along a specified route when there are no anomalous objects in the scene.The query sequences are captured online by the robot when it is patrolling in the same scene following the same route.Our benchmark dataset is elaborated such that each query image can find a corresponding reference based on accurate robot localization along the same route in the prebuilt 3D map, with which the reference and query images can be geometrically aligned using adaptive warping.Besides the proposed benchmark dataset, we evaluate the baseline models of ADr on this dataset.</p>

                  <p>The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized role-playing, enabling the development of general role-playing models.However, current role-playing training has two significant issues: (I) Using a predefined role profile to prompt dialogue training for specific scenarios usually leads to inconsistencies and even conflicts between the dialogue and the profile, resulting in training biases.(II)The model learns to imitate the role based solely on the profile, neglecting profile-dialogue alignment at the sentence level.In this work, we propose a simple yet effective framework called BEYOND DIALOGUE, designed to overcome these hurdles.This framework innovatively introduces "beyond dialogue" tasks to align dialogue with profile traits based on each specific scenario, thereby eliminating biases during training.Furthermore, by adopting an innovative prompting mechanism that generates reasoning outcomes for training, the framework allows the model to achieve fine-grained alignment between profile and dialogue at the sentence level.The aforementioned methods are fully automated and low-cost.Additionally, the integration of automated dialogue and objective evaluation methods forms a comprehensive framework, paving the way for general role-playing.Experimental results demonstrate that our model excels in adhering to and reflecting various dimensions of role profiles, outperforming most proprietary general and specialized role-playing baselines.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>All code and datasets are available at https://github.com/yuyouyu32/BeyondDialogue. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.796</span></span></p>

                  <p>Facial wrinkle detection plays a crucial role in cosmetic dermatology.Precise manual segmentation of facial wrinkles is challenging and time-consuming, with inherent subjectivity leading to inconsistent results among graders.To address this issue, we propose two solutions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>First, we build and release the first public facial wrinkle dataset, `FFHQ-Wrinkle', an extension of the NVIDIA FFHQ dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.879</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This dataset includes 1,000 images with human labels and 50,000 images with automatically generated weak labels. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.922</span></span>This dataset can foster the research community to develop advanced wrinkle detection algorithms.Second, we introduce a training strategy for U-Net-like encoder-decoder models to detect wrinkles across the face automatically.Our method employs a two-stage training strategy: texture map pretraining and finetuning on human-labeled data.Initially, we pretrain models on a large dataset with weak labels (N=50k) or masked texture maps generated through computer vision techniques, without human intervention.Subsequently, we finetune the models using human-labeled data (N=1k), which consists of manually labeled wrinkle masks.During finetuning, the network inputs a combination of RGB and masked texture maps, comprising four channels.We effectively combine labels from multiple annotators to minimize subjectivity in manual labeling.Our strategies demonstrate improved segmentation performance in facial wrinkle segmentation both quantitatively and visually compared to existing pretraining methods.</p>

                  <p>Stereo matching, a critical step of 3D reconstruction, has fully shifted towards deep learning due to its strong feature representation of remote sensing images.However, ground truth for stereo matching task relies on expensive airborne LiDAR data, thus making it difficult to obtain enough samples for supervised learning.To improve the generalization ability of stereo matching networks on cross-domain data from different sensors and scenarios, in this paper, we dedicate to study key training factors from three perspectives.(1) For the selection of training dataset, it is important to select data with similar regional target distribution as the test set instead of utilizing data from the same sensor.(2) For model structure, cascaded structure that flexibly adapts to different sizes of features is preferred.(3) For training manner, unsupervised methods generalize better than supervised methods, and we design an unsupervised early-stop strategy to help retain the best model with pre-trained weights as the basis.Extensive experiments are conducted to support the previous findings, on the basis of which we present an unsupervised stereo matching network with good generalization performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We release the source code and the datasets at https://github.com/Elenairene/RKF_RSSM to reproduce the results and encourage future work. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.724</span></span></p>

                  <p>Current long context large language models (LLMs) can process inputs up to 100,000 tokens, yet struggle to generate outputs exceeding even a modest length of 2,000 words.Through controlled experiments, we find that the model's effective generation length is inherently bounded by the sample it has seen during supervised fine-tuning (SFT).In other words, their output limitation is due to the scarcity of long-output examples in existing SFT datasets.To address this, we introduce AgentWrite, an agent-based pipeline that decomposes ultra-long generation tasks into subtasks, enabling off-the-shelf LLMs to generate coherent outputs exceeding 20,000 words.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Leveraging AgentWrite, we construct LongWriter-6k, a dataset containing 6,000 SFT data with output lengths ranging from 2k to 32k words. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.84</span></span>By incorporating this dataset into model training, we successfully scale the output length of existing models to over 10,000 words while maintaining output quality.We also develop LongBench-Write, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating ultra-long generation capabilities.Our 9B parameter model, further improved through DPO, achieves state-of-the-art performance on this benchmark, surpassing even much larger proprietary models.In general, our work demonstrates that existing long context LLM already possesses the potential for a larger output window--all you need is data with extended output during model alignment to unlock this capability.Our code & models are at: https://github.com/THUDM/LongWriter.</p>

                  <p>Facial wrinkle detection plays a crucial role in cosmetic dermatology.Precise manual segmentation of facial wrinkles is challenging and time-consuming, with inherent subjectivity leading to inconsistent results among graders.To address this issue, we propose two solutions.First, we build and release the first public facial wrinkle dataset, `FFHQ-Wrinkle', an extension of the NVIDIA FFHQ dataset.This dataset includes 1,000 images with human labels and 50,000 images with automatically generated weak labels.This dataset can foster the research community to develop advanced wrinkle detection algorithms.Second, we introduce a training strategy for U-Net-like encoder-decoder models to detect wrinkles across the face automatically.Our method employs a two-stage training strategy: texture map pretraining and finetuning on human-labeled data.Initially, we pretrain models on a large dataset with weak labels (N=50k) or masked texture maps generated through computer vision techniques, without human intervention.Subsequently, we finetune the models using human-labeled data (N=1k), which consists of manually labeled wrinkle masks.During finetuning, the network inputs a combination of RGB and masked texture maps, comprising four channels.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We effectively combine labels from multiple annotators to minimize subjectivity in manual labeling. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.661</span></span>Our strategies demonstrate improved segmentation performance in facial wrinkle segmentation both quantitatively and visually compared to existing pretraining methods.</p>

                  <p>Recent research on knowledge distillation has increasingly focused on logit distillation because of its simplicity, effectiveness, and versatility in model compression.In this paper, we introduce Refined Logit Distillation (RLD) to address the limitations of current logit distillation methods.Our approach is motivated by the observation that even high-performing teacher models can make incorrect predictions, creating a conflict between the standard distillation loss and the cross-entropy loss.This conflict can undermine the consistency of the student model's learning objectives.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Previous attempts to use labels to empirically correct teacher predictions may undermine the class correlation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span>In contrast, our RLD employs labeling information to dynamically refine teacher logits.In this way, our method can effectively eliminate misleading information from the teacher while preserving crucial class correlations, thus enhancing the value and efficiency of distilled knowledge.Experimental results on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet demonstrate its superiority over existing methods.The code is provided at \text{https://github.com/zju-SWJ/RLD}.</p>

                  <p>Clinical machine learning research and AI driven clinical decision support models rely on clinically accurate labels.Manually extracting these labels with the help of clinical specialists is often time-consuming and expensive.This study tests the feasibility of automatic span- and document-level diagnosis extraction from unstructured Dutch echocardiogram reports.

                  <p>The Polytope Scheduling Problem (PSP) was introduced by Im, Kulkarni, and Munagala (JACM 2018) as a very general abstraction of resource allocation over time and captures many well-studied problems including classical unrelated machine scheduling, multidimensional scheduling, and broadcast scheduling.In PSP, jobs with different arrival times receive processing rates that are subject to arbitrary packing constraints.An elegant and well-known algorithm for instantaneous rate allocation with good fairness and efficiency properties is the Proportional Fairness algorithm (PF), which was analyzed for PSP by Im et al.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We drastically improve the analysis of the PF algorithm for both the general PSP and several of its important special cases subject to the objective of minimizing the sum of weighted completion times. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span>We reduce the upper bound on the competitive ratio from 128 to 27 for general PSP and to 4 for the prominent class of monotone PSP.For certain heterogeneous machine environments we even close the substantial gap to the lower bound of 2 for non-clairvoyant scheduling.Our analysis also gives the first polynomial-time improvements over the nearly 30-year-old bounds on the competitive ratio of the doubling framework by Hall, Shmoys, and Wein (SODA 1996) for clairvoyant online preemptive scheduling on unrelated machines.Somewhat surprisingly, we achieve this improvement by a non-clairvoyant algorithm, thereby demonstrating that non-clairvoyance is not a (significant) hurdle.   Our improvements are based on exploiting monotonicity properties of PSP, providing tight dual fitting arguments on structured instances, and showing new additivity properties on the optimal objective value for scheduling on unrelated machines.Finally, we establish new connections of PF to matching markets, and thereby provide new insights on equilibria and their computational complexity.</p>

                  <p>Data augmentation is widely used for training a neural network given little labeled data.A common practice of augmentation training is applying a composition of multiple transformations sequentially to the data.Existing augmentation methods such as RandAugment randomly sample from a list of pre-selected transformations, while methods such as AutoAugment apply advanced search to optimize over an augmentation set of size $k^d$, which is the number of transformation sequences of length $d$, given a list of $k$ transformations.   In this paper, we design efficient algorithms whose running time complexity is much faster than the worst-case complexity of $O(k^d)$, provably.We propose a new algorithm to search for a binary tree-structured composition of $k$ transformations, where each tree node corresponds to one transformation.The binary tree generalizes sequential augmentations, such as the SimCLR augmentation scheme for contrastive learning.Using a top-down, recursive search procedure, our algorithm achieves a runtime complexity of $O(2^d k)$, which is much faster than $O(k^d)$ as $k$ increases above $2$. We apply our algorithm to tackle data distributions with heterogeneous subpopulations by searching for one tree in each subpopulation and then learning a weighted combination, resulting in a forest of trees.   We validate our proposed algorithms on numerous graph and image datasets, including a multi-label graph classification dataset we collected.The dataset exhibits significant variations in the sizes of graphs and their average degrees, making it ideal for studying data augmentation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We show that our approach can reduce the computation cost by 43% over existing search methods while improving performance by 4.3%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span>The tree structures can be used to interpret the relative importance of each transformation, such as identifying the important transformations on small vs. large graphs.</p>

                  <p>The facial sketch synthesis (FSS) model, capable of generating sketch portraits from given facial photographs, holds profound implications across multiple domains, encompassing cross-modal face recognition, entertainment, art, media, among others.However, the production of high-quality sketches remains a formidable task, primarily due to the challenges and flaws associated with three key factors: (1) the scarcity of artist-drawn data, (2) the constraints imposed by limited style types, and (3) the deficiencies of processing input information in existing models.To address these difficulties, we propose a lightweight end-to-end synthesis model that efficiently converts images to corresponding multi-stylized sketches, obviating the necessity for any supplementary inputs (\eg, 3D geometry).In this study, we overcome the issue of data insufficiency by incorporating semi-supervised learning into the training process.Additionally, we employ a feature extraction module and style embeddings to proficiently steer the generative transformer during the iterative prediction of masked image tokens, thus achieving a continuous stylized output that retains facial features accurately in sketches.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms previous algorithms across multiple benchmarks, exhibiting a discernible disparity. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.778</span></span></p>

                  <p>Forecasting the behaviour of complex dynamical systems such as interconnected sensor networks characterized by high-dimensional multivariate time series(MTS) is of paramount importance for making informed decisions and planning for the future in a broad spectrum of applications.Graph forecasting networks(GFNs) are well-suited for forecasting MTS data that exhibit spatio-temporal dependencies.However, most prior works of GFN-based methods on MTS forecasting rely on domain-expertise to model the nonlinear dynamics of the system, but neglect the potential to leverage the inherent relational-structural dependencies among time series variables underlying MTS data.On the other hand, contemporary works attempt to infer the relational structure of the complex dependencies between the variables and simultaneously learn the nonlinear dynamics of the interconnected system but neglect the possibility of incorporating domain-specific prior knowledge to improve forecast accuracy.To this end, we propose a hybrid architecture that combines explicit prior knowledge with implicit knowledge of the relational structure within the MTS data.It jointly learns intra-series temporal dependencies and inter-series spatial dependencies by encoding time-conditioned structural spatio-temporal inductive biases to provide more accurate and reliable forecasts.It also models the time-varying uncertainty of the multi-horizon forecasts to support decision-making by providing estimates of prediction uncertainty.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The proposed architecture has shown promising results on multiple benchmark datasets and outperforms state-of-the-art forecasting methods by a significant margin. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.623</span></span>We report and discuss the ablation studies to validate our forecasting architecture.</p>

                  <p>Anomaly detection is critical in surveillance systems and patrol robots by identifying anomalous regions in images for early warning.Depending on whether reference data are utilized, anomaly detection can be categorized into anomaly detection with reference and anomaly detection without reference.Currently, anomaly detection without reference, which is closely related to out-of-distribution (OoD) object detection, struggles with learning anomalous patterns due to the difficulty of collecting sufficiently large and diverse anomaly datasets with the inherent rarity and novelty of anomalies.Alternatively, anomaly detection with reference employs the scheme of change detection to identify anomalies by comparing semantic changes between a reference image and a query one.However, there are very few ADr works due to the scarcity of public datasets in this domain.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we aim to address this gap by introducing the UMAD Benchmark Dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>To our best knowledge, this is the first benchmark dataset designed specifically for anomaly detection with reference in robotic patrolling scenarios, e.g., where an autonomous robot is employed to detect anomalous objects by comparing a reference and a query video sequences.The reference sequences can be taken by the robot along a specified route when there are no anomalous objects in the scene.The query sequences are captured online by the robot when it is patrolling in the same scene following the same route.Our benchmark dataset is elaborated such that each query image can find a corresponding reference based on accurate robot localization along the same route in the prebuilt 3D map, with which the reference and query images can be geometrically aligned using adaptive warping.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Besides the proposed benchmark dataset, we evaluate the baseline models of ADr on this dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.63</span></span></p>

                  <p>Background: Data quality is vital in software analytics, particularly for machine learning (ML) applications like software defect prediction (SDP).Despite the widespread use of ML in software engineering, the effect of data quality antipatterns on these models remains underexplored.   Objective: This study develops a taxonomy of ML-specific data quality antipatterns and assesses their impact on software analytics models' performance and interpretation.   Methods: We identified eight types and 14 sub-types of ML-specific data quality antipatterns through a literature review.We conducted experiments to determine the prevalence of these antipatterns in SDP data (RQ1), assess how cleaning order affects model performance (RQ2), evaluate the impact of antipattern removal on performance (RQ3), and examine the consistency of interpretation from models built with different antipatterns (RQ4).   Results:In our SDP case study, we identified nine antipatterns.Over 90% of these overlapped at both row and column levels, complicating cleaning prioritization and risking excessive data removal.The order of cleaning significantly impacts ML model performance, with neural networks being more resilient to cleaning order changes than simpler models like logistic regression.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Antipatterns such as Tailed Distributions and Class Overlap show a statistically significant correlation with performance metrics when other antipatterns are cleaned. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span>Models built with different antipatterns showed moderate consistency in interpretation results.   Conclusion: The cleaning order of different antipatterns impacts ML model performance.Five antipatterns have a statistically significant correlation with model performance when others are cleaned.Additionally, model interpretation is moderately affected by different data quality antipatterns.</p>

                  <p>Neural implicit reconstruction via volume rendering has demonstrated its effectiveness in recovering dense 3D surfaces.However, it is non-trivial to simultaneously recover meticulous geometry and preserve smoothness across regions with differing characteristics.To address this issue, previous methods typically employ geometric priors, which are often constrained by the performance of the prior models.In this paper, we propose ND-SDF, which learns a Normal Ddeflection field to represent the angular deviation between the scene normal and the prior normal.Unlike previous methods that uniformly apply geometric priors on all samples, introducing significant bias in accuracy, our proposed normal deflection field dynamically learns and adapts the utilization of samples based on their specific characteristics, thereby improving both the accuracy and effectiveness of the model.Our method not only obtains smooth weakly textured regions such as walls and floors but also preserves the geometric details of complex structures.In addition, we introduce a novel ray sampling strategy based on the deflection angle to facilitate the unbiased rendering process, which significantly improves the quality and accuracy of intricate surfaces, especially on thin structures.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Consistent improvements on various challenging datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.649</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large vision-language models (VLMs) have shown significant performance boost in various application domains.However, adopting them to deal with several sequentially encountered tasks has been challenging because finetuning a VLM on a task normally leads to reducing its generalization power and the capacity of learning new tasks as well as causing catastrophic forgetting on previously learned tasks.Enabling using VLMs in multimodal continual learning (CL) settings can help to address such scenarios.To improve generalization capacity and prevent catastrophic forgetting, we propose a novel prompt-based CL method for VLMs, namely $\textbf{Clu}$ster-based $\textbf{Mo}$dality Fusion Prompt (\textbf{CluMo}).We design a novel \textbf{Key-Key-Prompt} pair, where each prompt is associated with a visual prompt key and a textual prompt key.We adopt a two-stage training strategy.During the first stage, the single-modal keys are trained via $K$-means clustering algorithm to help select the best semantically matched prompt.During the second stage, the prompt keys are frozen, the selected prompt is attached to the input for training the VLM in the CL scenario.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves SOTA performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span></p>

                  <p>The ICP registration algorithm has been a preferred method for LiDAR-based robot localization for nearly a decade.However, even in modern SLAM solutions, ICP can degrade and become unreliable in geometrically ill-conditioned environments.Current solutions primarily focus on utilizing additional sources of information, such as external odometry, to either replace the degenerate directions of the optimization solution or add additional constraints in a sensor-fusion setup afterward.In response, this work investigates and compares new and existing degeneracy mitigation methods for robust LiDAR-based localization and analyzes the efficacy of these approaches in degenerate environments for the first time in the literature at this scale.Specifically, this work proposes and investigates i) the incorporation of different types of constraints into the ICP algorithm, ii) the effect of using active or passive degeneracy mitigation techniques, and iii) the choice of utilizing global point cloud registration methods on the ill-conditioned ICP problem in LiDAR degenerate environments.The study results are validated through multiple real-world field and simulated experiments.The analysis shows that active optimization degeneracy mitigation is necessary and advantageous in the absence of reliable external estimate assistance for LiDAR-SLAM.Furthermore, introducing degeneracy-aware hard constraints in the optimization before or during the optimization is shown to perform better in the wild than by including the constraints after.Moreover, with heuristic fine-tuned parameters, soft constraints can provide equal or better results in complex ill-conditioned scenarios.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The implementations used in the analysis of this work are made publicly available to the community. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span></p>

                  <p>As machine-learning models grow in size, their implementation requirements cannot be met by a single computer system.This observation motivates distributed settings, in which intermediate computations are performed across a network of processing units, while the central node only aggregates their outputs.However, distributing inference tasks across low-precision or faulty edge devices, operating over a network of noisy communication channels, gives rise to serious reliability challenges.We study the problem of an ensemble of devices, implementing regression algorithms, that communicate through additive noisy channels in order to collaboratively perform a joint regression task.We define the problem formally, and develop methods for optimizing the aggregation coefficients for the parameters of the noise in the channels, which can potentially be correlated.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results apply to the leading state-of-the-art ensemble regression methods: bagging and gradient boosting. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms on both synthetic and real-world datasets.</p>

                  <p>Recent studies show that well-devised perturbations on graph structures or node features can mislead trained Graph Neural Network (GNN) models.However, these methods often overlook practical assumptions, over-rely on heuristics, or separate vital attack components.In response, we present GAIM, an integrated adversarial attack method conducted on a node feature basis while considering the strict black-box setting.Specifically, we define an adversarial influence function to theoretically assess the adversarial impact of node perturbations, thereby reframing the GNN attack problem into the adversarial influence maximization problem.In our approach, we unify the selection of the target node and the construction of feature perturbations into a single optimization problem, ensuring a unique and consistent feature perturbation for each target node.We leverage a surrogate model to transform this problem into a solvable linear programming task, streamlining the optimization process.Moreover, we extend our method to accommodate label-oriented attacks, broadening its applicability.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Thorough evaluations on five benchmark datasets across three popular models underscore the effectiveness of our method in both untargeted and label-oriented targeted attacks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.629</span></span>Through comprehensive analysis and ablation studies, we demonstrate the practical value and efficacy inherent to our design choices.</p>

                  <p>Network energy saving has received great attention from operators and vendors to reduce energy consumption and CO2 emissions to the environment as well as significantly reduce costs for mobile network operators.However, the design of energy-saving networks also needs to ensure the mobile users' (MUs) QoS requirements such as throughput requirements (TR).This work considers a mobile cellular network including many ground base stations (GBSs), and some GBSs are intentionally turned off due to network energy saving (NES) or crash, so the MUs located in these outage GBSs are not served in time.Based on this observation, we propose the problem of maximizing the total achievable throughput in the network by optimizing the GBSs' antenna tilt and adaptive transmission power with a given number of served MUs satisfied.Notice that, the MU is considered successfully served if its Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) and throughput requirement are satisfied.The formulated optimization problem becomes difficult to solve with multiple binary variables and non-convex constraints along with random throughput requirements and random placement of MUs.We propose a Deep Q-learning-based algorithm to help the network learn the uncertainty and dynamics of the transmission environment.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive simulation results show that our proposed algorithm achieves much better performance than the benchmark schemes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.781</span></span></p>

                  <p>Industry 4.0 has revolutionized manufacturing by driving digitalization and shifting the paradigm toward additive manufacturing (AM).Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), a key AM technology, enables the creation of highly customized, cost-effective products with minimal material waste through layer-by-layer extrusion, posing a significant challenge to traditional subtractive methods.However, the susceptibility of material extrusion techniques to errors often requires expert intervention to detect and mitigate defects that can severely compromise product quality.While automated error detection and machine learning models exist, their generalizability across diverse 3D printer setups, firmware, and sensors is limited, and deep learning methods require extensive labeled datasets, hindering scalability and adaptability.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address these challenges, we present a process monitoring and control framework that leverages pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) alongside 3D printers to detect and address printing defects. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.634</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The LLM evaluates print quality by analyzing images captured after each layer or print segment, identifying failure modes and querying the printer for relevant parameters. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.694</span></span>It then generates and executes a corrective action plan.We validated the effectiveness of the proposed framework in identifying defects by comparing it against a control group of engineers with diverse AM expertise.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our evaluation demonstrated that LLM-based agents not only accurately identify common 3D printing errors, such as inconsistent extrusion, stringing, warping, and layer adhesion, but also effectively determine the parameters causing these failures and autonomously correct them without any need for human intervention. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.673</span></span></p>

                  <p>Automated unit test generators, particularly search-based software testing tools like EvoSuite, are capable of generating tests with high coverage.Although these generators alleviate the burden of writing unit tests, they often pose challenges for software engineers in terms of understanding the generated tests.To address this, we introduce UTGen, which combines search-based software testing and large language models to enhance the understandability of automatically generated test cases.We achieve this enhancement through contextualizing test data, improving identifier naming, and adding descriptive comments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through a controlled experiment with 32 participants from both academia and industry, we investigate how the understandability of unit tests affects a software engineer's ability to perform bug-fixing tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.644</span></span>We selected bug-fixing to simulate a real-world scenario that emphasizes the importance of understandable test cases.We observe that participants working on assignments with UTGen test cases fix up to 33% more bugs and use up to 20% less time when compared to baseline test cases.From the post-test questionnaire, we gathered that participants found that enhanced test names, test data, and variable names improved their bug-fixing process.</p>

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to early detection of performance regressions by bridging the local performance data generated by component-level testing and the system-level architectural models.Our approach uses local performance data to identify deviations at the component level, and then propagate these deviations to the architectural model.We then use the architectural model to predict regressions in the performance of the overall system.We evaluate our approach on two open-source benchmark systems and show that it can effectively detect end-to-end system performance regressions from local performance deviations with different intensities and under various system workloads.More importantly, our approach can detect regressions as early as in the development phase, in contrast to existing approaches that require the system to be fully built and deployed.Our approach is lightweight and can complement traditional system performance testing when testing resources are scarce.</p>

                  <p>The Rust programming language has garnered significant attention due to its robust safety features and memory management capabilities.Despite its guaranteed memory safety, Rust programs still suffer from runtime errors that are unmanageable, i.e., panic errors.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Notably, over half of the bugs in rustc, Rust's own compiler, are attributable to crash stemming from panic errors. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>However, understanding root causes and resolving these panics often requires substantial effort due to the limited information provided, and the stack backtrace could be intricate, often omitting the actual fault locations.Although numerous automated program repair techniques exist, we observe that the prevailing fix patterns do not readily apply to Rust programs due to natural differences in language mechanisms.To tackle the above challenges, this paper introduces a systematic study aimed at fixing Rust panic bugs.We commence by assembling a dataset, namely Panic4R, which includes 102 real panic bugs and their fixes from the top 500 most downloaded open-source crates.By analyzing Rust's implementation, we identify Rust-specific patterns for fixing panic bugs, which can aid in understanding and providing guidance for generating patches.Finally, we design and implement the first automated fixing tool, PanicKiller, for Rust panic bugs, which effectively generates correct patches on the real-world large-scale dataset, and has already assisted in the resolution of 28 panic bugs in open-source projects.Each resolved issue has been validated by the developers and merged into the respective codebases.</p>
