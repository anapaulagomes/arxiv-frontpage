                  <p>Formal verification using proof assistants, such as Coq, enables the creation of high-quality software.However, the verification process requires significant expertise and manual effort to write proofs.Recent work has explored automating proof synthesis using machine learning and large language models (LLMs).This work has shown that identifying relevant premises, such as lemmas and definitions, can aid synthesis.We present Rango, a fully automated proof synthesis tool for Coq that automatically identifies relevant premises and also similar proofs from the current project and uses them during synthesis.Rango uses retrieval augmentation at every step of the proof to automatically determine which proofs and premises to include in the context of its fine-tuned LLM.In this way, Rango adapts to the project and to the evolving state of the proof.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We create a new dataset, CoqStoq, of 2,226 open-source Coq projects and 196,929 theorems from GitHub, which includes both training data and a curated evaluation benchmark of well-maintained projects. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.86</span></span>On this benchmark, Rango synthesizes proofs for 32.0% of the theorems, which is 29% more theorems than the prior state-of-the-art tool Tactician.Our evaluation also shows that Rango adding relevant proofs to its context leads to a 47% increase in the number of theorems proven.</p>

                  <p>Keyword extraction involves identifying the most descriptive words in a document, allowing automatic categorisation and summarisation of large quantities of diverse textual data.Relying on the insight that real-world keyword detection often requires handling of diverse content, we propose a novel supervised keyword extraction approach based on the mixture of experts (MoE) technique.MoE uses a learnable routing sub-network to direct information to specialised experts, allowing them to specialize in distinct regions of the input space.SEKE, a mixture of Specialised Experts for supervised Keyword Extraction, uses DeBERTa as the backbone model and builds on the MoE framework, where experts attend to each token, by integrating it with a recurrent neural network (RNN), to allow successful extraction even on smaller corpora, where specialisation is harder due to lack of training data.The MoE framework also provides an insight into inner workings of individual experts, enhancing the explainability of the approach.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We benchmark SEKE on multiple English datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to strong supervised and unsupervised baselines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.711</span></span>Our analysis reveals that depending on data size and type, experts specialize in distinct syntactic and semantic components, such as punctuation, stopwords, parts-of-speech, or named entities.Code is available at: https://github.com/matejMartinc/SEKE_keyword_extraction</p>

                  <p>Ultrasound imaging of the medial elbow is crucial for the early identification of Ulnar Collateral Ligament (UCL) injuries.Specifically, measuring the elbow joint space in ultrasound images is used to assess the valgus instability of elbow.To automate this measurement, a precisely annotated dataset is necessary; however, no publicly available dataset has been proposed thus far.This study introduces a novel ultrasound medial elbow dataset for measuring joint space to diagnose Ulnar Collateral Ligament (UCL) injuries.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset comprises 4,201 medial elbow ultrasound images from 22 subjects, with landmark annotations on the humerus and ulna. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.847</span></span>The annotations are made precisely by the authors under the supervision of three orthopedic surgeons.We evaluated joint space measurement methods using our proposed dataset with several landmark detection approaches, including ViTPose, HRNet, PCT, YOLOv8, and U-Net.In addition, we propose using Shape Subspace (SS) for landmark refinement in heatmap-based landmark detection.The results show that the mean Euclidean distance error of joint space is 0.116 mm when using HRNet.Furthermore, the SS landmark refinement improves the mean absolute error of landmark positions by 0.010 mm with HRNet and by 0.103 mm with ViTPose on average.These highlight the potential for high-precision, real-time diagnosis of UCL injuries and associated risks, which could be leveraged in large-scale screening.Lastly, we demonstrate point-based segmentation of the humerus and ulna using the detected landmarks as input.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset will be made publicly available upon acceptance of this paper at: https://github.com/Akahori000/Ultrasound-Medial-Elbow-Dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.801</span></span></p>

                  <p>Generating realistic human videos remains a challenging task, with the most effective methods currently relying on a human motion sequence as a control signal.Existing approaches often use existing motion extracted from other videos, which restricts applications to specific motion types and global scene matching.We propose Move-in-2D, a novel approach to generate human motion sequences conditioned on a scene image, allowing for diverse motion that adapts to different scenes.Our approach utilizes a diffusion model that accepts both a scene image and text prompt as inputs, producing a motion sequence tailored to the scene.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To train this model, we collect a large-scale video dataset featuring single-human activities, annotating each video with the corresponding human motion as the target output. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.708</span></span>Experiments demonstrate that our method effectively predicts human motion that aligns with the scene image after projection.Furthermore, we show that the generated motion sequence improves human motion quality in video synthesis tasks.</p>

                  <p>Most existing video understanding benchmarks for multimodal large language models (MLLMs) focus only on short videos.The limited number of benchmarks for long video understanding often rely solely on multiple-choice questions (MCQs).However, because of the inherent limitation of MCQ-based evaluation and the increasing reasoning ability of MLLMs, models can give the current answer purely by combining short video understanding with elimination, without genuinely understanding the video content.To address this gap, we introduce CG-Bench, a novel benchmark designed for clue-grounded question answering in long videos.CG-Bench emphasizes the model's ability to retrieve relevant clues for questions, enhancing evaluation credibility.It features 1,219 manually curated videos categorized by a granular system with 14 primary categories, 171 secondary categories, and 638 tertiary categories, making it the largest benchmark for long video analysis.The benchmark includes 12,129 QA pairs in three major question types: perception, reasoning, and hallucination.Compensating the drawbacks of pure MCQ-based evaluation, we design two novel clue-based evaluation methods: clue-grounded white box and black box evaluations, to assess whether the model generates answers based on the correct understanding of the video.We evaluate multiple closed-source and open-source MLLMs on CG-Bench.Results indicate that current models significantly underperform in understanding long videos compared to short ones, and a significant gap exists between open-source and commercial models.We hope CG-Bench can advance the development of more trustworthy and capable MLLMs for long video understanding.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>All annotations and video data are released at https://cg-bench.github.io/leaderboard/. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.772</span></span></p>

                  <p>Identifying affordance regions on 3D objects from semantic cues is essential for robotics and human-machine interaction.However, existing 3D affordance learning methods struggle with generalization and robustness due to limited annotated data and a reliance on 3D backbones focused on geometric encoding, which often lack resilience to real-world noise and data corruption.We propose GEAL, a novel framework designed to enhance the generalization and robustness of 3D affordance learning by leveraging large-scale pre-trained 2D models.We employ a dual-branch architecture with Gaussian splatting to establish consistent mappings between 3D point clouds and 2D representations, enabling realistic 2D renderings from sparse point clouds.A granularity-adaptive fusion module and a 2D-3D consistency alignment module further strengthen cross-modal alignment and knowledge transfer, allowing the 3D branch to benefit from the rich semantics and generalization capacity of 2D models.To holistically assess the robustness, we introduce two new corruption-based benchmarks: PIAD-C and LASO-C. Extensive experiments on public datasets and our benchmarks show that GEAL consistently outperforms existing methods across seen and novel object categories, as well as corrupted data, demonstrating robust and adaptable affordance prediction under diverse conditions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code and corruption datasets have been made publicly available. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.891</span></span></p>

                  <p>This paper describes a semi-automatic pipeline to generate challenging question-answer-decoy sets for understanding long videos.Many existing video datasets and models are focused on short clips (10s-30s).While some long video datasets do exist, they can often be solved by powerful image models applied per frame (and often to very few frames) in a video, and are usually manually annotated at high cost.In order to mitigate both these problems, we propose a scalable dataset creation pipeline which leverages large models (VLMs and LLMs), to automatically generate dense, time-aligned video captions, as well as tough question answer decoy sets for video segments (up to 15 minutes in length).Our dataset Neptune covers a broad range of long video reasoning abilities and consists of a subset that emphasizes multimodal reasoning.Since existing metrics for open-ended question answering are either rule-based or may rely on proprietary models, we provide a new open source model-based metric GEM to score open-ended responses on Neptune.Benchmark evaluations reveal that most current open-source long video models perform poorly on Neptune, particularly on questions testing temporal ordering, counting and state changes.Through Neptune, we aim to spur the development of more advanced models capable of understanding long videos.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset is available at https://github.com/google-deepmind/neptune <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.823</span></span></p>

                  <p>Model inversion attacks pose a significant privacy threat to machine learning models by reconstructing sensitive data from their outputs.While various defenses have been proposed to counteract these attacks, they often come at the cost of the classifier's utility, thus creating a challenging trade-off between privacy protection and model utility.Moreover, most existing defenses require retraining the classifier for enhanced robustness, which is impractical for large-scale, well-established models.This paper introduces a novel defense mechanism to better balance privacy and utility, particularly against adversaries who employ a machine learning model (i.e., inversion model) to reconstruct private data.Drawing inspiration from data poisoning attacks, which can compromise the performance of machine learning models, we propose a strategy that leverages data poisoning to contaminate the training data of inversion models, thereby preventing model inversion attacks.   Two defense methods are presented.The first, termed label-preserving poisoning attacks for all output vectors (LPA), involves subtle perturbations to all output vectors while preserving their labels.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings demonstrate that these minor perturbations, introduced through a data poisoning approach, significantly increase the difficulty of data reconstruction without compromising the utility of the classifier. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>Subsequently, we introduce a second method, label-flipping poisoning for partial output vectors (LFP), which selectively perturbs a small subset of output vectors and alters their labels during the process.Empirical results indicate that LPA is notably effective, outperforming the current state-of-the-art defenses.Our data poisoning-based defense provides a new retraining-free defense paradigm that preserves the victim classifier's utility.</p>

                  <p>Multimodal recommendation systems can learn users' preferences from existing user-item interactions as well as the semantics of multimodal data associated with items.Many existing methods model this through a multimodal user-item graph, approaching multimodal recommendation as a graph learning task.Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promising performance in this domain.Prior research has capitalized on GNNs' capability to capture neighborhood information within certain receptive fields (typically denoted by the number of hops, $K$) to enrich user and item semantics.We observe that the optimal receptive fields for GNNs can vary across different modalities.In this paper, we propose GNNs with Modality-Independent Receptive Fields, which employ separate GNNs with independent receptive fields for different modalities to enhance performance.Our results indicate that the optimal $K$ for certain modalities on specific datasets can be as low as 1 or 2, which may restrict the GNNs' capacity to capture global information.To address this, we introduce a Sampling-based Global Transformer, which utilizes uniform global sampling to effectively integrate global information for GNNs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct comprehensive experiments that demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span>Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/CrawlScript/MIG-GT.</p>

                  <p>Causal discovery is essential for understanding complex systems, yet traditional methods often depend on strong, untestable assumptions, making the process challenging.Large Language Models (LLMs) present a promising alternative for extracting causal insights from text-based metadata, which consolidates domain expertise.However, LLMs are prone to unreliability and hallucinations, necessitating strategies that account for their limitations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>One such strategy involves leveraging a consistency measure to evaluate reliability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.6</span></span>Additionally, most text metadata does not clearly distinguish direct causal relationships from indirect ones, further complicating the inference of causal graphs.As a result, focusing on causal orderings, rather than causal graphs, emerges as a more practical and robust approach.We propose a novel method to derive a distribution of acyclic tournaments (representing plausible causal orders) that maximizes a consistency score.Our approach begins by computing pairwise consistency scores between variables, yielding a cyclic tournament that aggregates these scores.From this structure, we identify optimal acyclic tournaments compatible with the original tournament, prioritizing those that maximize consistency across all configurations.We tested our method on both classical and well-established bechmarks, as well as real-world datasets from epidemiology and public health.Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in recovering distributions causal orders with minimal error.</p>

                  <p>CNNs have become one of the most commonly used computational tool in the past two decades.One of the primary downsides of CNNs is that they work as a ``black box", where the user cannot necessarily know how the image data are analyzed, and therefore needs to rely on empirical evaluation to test the efficacy of a trained CNN.This can lead to hidden biases that affect the performance evaluation of neural networks, but are difficult to identify.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Here we discuss examples of such hidden biases in common and widely used benchmark datasets, and propose techniques for identifying dataset biases that can affect the standard performance evaluation metrics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.667</span></span>One effective approach to identify dataset bias is to perform image classification by using merely blank background parts of the original images.However, in some situations a blank background in the images is not available, making it more difficult to separate foreground or contextual information from the bias.To overcome this, we propose a method to identify dataset bias without the need to crop background information from the images.That method is based on applying several image transforms to the original images, including Fourier transform, wavelet transforms, median filter, and their combinations.These transforms were applied to recover background bias information that CNNs use to classify images.This transformations affect the contextual visual information in a different manner than it affects the systemic background bias.Therefore, the method can distinguish between contextual information and the bias, and alert on the presence of background bias even without the need to separate sub-images parts from the blank background of the original images.Code used in the experiments is publicly available.</p>

                  <p>In many data-driven decision-making problems, performance guarantees often depend heavily on the correctness of model assumptions, which may frequently fail in practice.We address this issue in the context of a feature-based newsvendor problem, where demand is influenced by observed features such as demographics and seasonality.To mitigate the impact of model misspecification, we propose a model-free and distribution-free framework inspired by conformal prediction.Our approach consists of two phases: a training phase, which can utilize any type of prediction method, and a calibration phase that conformalizes the model bias.To enhance predictive performance, we explore the balance between data quality and quantity, recognizing the inherent trade-off: more selective training data improves quality but reduces quantity.Importantly, we provide statistical guarantees for the conformalized critical quantile, independent of the correctness of the underlying model.Moreover, we quantify the confidence interval of the critical quantile, with its width decreasing as data quality and quantity improve.We validate our framework using both simulated data and a real-world dataset from the Capital Bikeshare program in Washington, D.C.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Across these experiments, our proposed method consistently outperforms benchmark algorithms, reducing newsvendor loss by up to 40% on the simulated data and 25% on the real-world dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.657</span></span></p>

                  <p>Given the ubiquity of multi-task in practical systems, Multi-Task Learning (MTL) has found widespread application across diverse domains.In real-world scenarios, these tasks often have different priorities.For instance, In web search, relevance is often prioritized over other metrics, such as click-through rates or user engagement.Existing frameworks pay insufficient attention to the prioritization among different tasks, which typically adjust task-specific loss function weights to differentiate task priorities.However, this approach encounters challenges as the number of tasks grows, leading to exponential increases in hyper-parameter tuning complexity.Furthermore, the simultaneous optimization of multiple objectives can negatively impact the performance of high-priority tasks due to interference from lower-priority tasks.   In this paper, we introduce a novel multi-task learning framework employing Lagrangian Differential Multiplier Methods for step-wise multi-task optimization.It is designed to boost the performance of high-priority tasks without interference from other tasks.Its primary advantage lies in its ability to automatically optimize multiple objectives without requiring balancing hyper-parameters for different tasks, thereby eliminating the need for manual tuning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, we provide theoretical analysis demonstrating that our method ensures optimization guarantees, enhancing the reliability of the process. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span>We demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments on multiple public datasets and its application in Taobao search, a large-scale industrial search ranking system, resulting in significant improvements across various business metrics.</p>

                  <p>Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) requires models to continually acquire knowledge of new classes without forgetting old ones.Despite Pre-trained Models (PTMs) have shown excellent performance in CIL, catastrophic forgetting still occurs as the model learns new concepts.Existing work seeks to utilize lightweight components to adjust the PTM, while the forgetting phenomenon still comes from {\em parameter and retrieval} levels.Specifically, iterative updates of the model result in parameter drift, while mistakenly retrieving irrelevant modules leads to the mismatch during inference.To this end, we propose MOdel Surgery (MOS) to rescue the model from forgetting previous knowledge.By training task-specific adapters, we continually adjust the PTM to downstream tasks.To mitigate parameter-level forgetting, we present an adapter merging approach to learn task-specific adapters, which aims to bridge the gap between different components while reserve task-specific information.Besides, to address retrieval-level forgetting, we introduce a training-free self-refined adapter retrieval mechanism during inference, which leverages the model's inherent ability for better adapter retrieval.By jointly rectifying the model with those steps, MOS can robustly resist catastrophic forgetting in the learning process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets validate MOS's state-of-the-art performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.693</span></span>Code is available at: https://github.com/sun-hailong/AAAI25-MOS</p>

                  <p>This paper proposes dialogue as a method for evaluating generative AI tools for culturally-situated creative practice, that recognizes the socially situated nature of art.Drawing on sociologist Howard Becker's concept of Art Worlds, this method expands the scope of traditional AI and creativity evaluations beyond benchmarks, user studies with crowd-workers, or focus groups conducted with artists.Our method involves two mutually informed dialogues: 1) 'dialogues with art worlds' placing artists in conversation with experts such as art historians, curators, and archivists, and 2)'dialogues with the machine,' facilitated through structured artist- and critic-led experimentation with state-of-the-art generative AI tools.We demonstrate the value of this method through a case study with artists and experts steeped in non-western art worlds, specifically the Persian Gulf.We trace how these dialogues help create culturally rich and situated forms of evaluation for representational possibilities of generative AI that mimic the reception of generative artwork in the broader art ecosystem.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Putting artists in conversation with commentators also allow artists to shift their use of the tools to respond to their cultural and creative context. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span>Our study can provide generative AI researchers an understanding of the complex dynamics of technology, human creativity and the socio-politics of art worlds, to build more inclusive machines for diverse art worlds.</p>

                  <p>OpenAI o1 represents a significant milestone in Artificial Inteiligence, which achieves expert-level performances on many challanging tasks that require strong reasoning ability.OpenAI has claimed that the main techinique behinds o1 is the reinforcement learining.Recent works use alternative approaches like knowledge distillation to imitate o1's reasoning style, but their effectiveness is limited by the capability ceiling of the teacher model.Therefore, this paper analyzes the roadmap to achieving o1 from the perspective of reinforcement learning, focusing on four key components: policy initialization, reward design, search, and learning.Policy initialization enables models to develop human-like reasoning behaviors, equipping them with the ability to effectively explore solution spaces for complex problems.Reward design provides dense and effective signals via reward shaping or reward modeling, which is the guidance for both search and learning.Search plays a crucial role in generating high-quality solutions during both training and testing phases, which can produce better solutions with more computation.Learning utilizes the data generated by search for improving policy, which can achieve the better performance with more parameters and more searched data.Existing open-source projects that attempt to reproduce o1 can be seem as a part or a variant of our roadmap.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Collectively, these components underscore how learning and search drive o1's advancement, making meaningful contributions to the development of LLM. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.673</span></span></p>
