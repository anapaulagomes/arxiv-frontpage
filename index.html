                  <p>Multimodal Foundation Models (MFMs) excel at representing diverse raw modalities (e.g., text, images, audio, videos, etc.).As recommender systems increasingly incorporate these modalities, leveraging MFMs to generate better representations has great potential.However, their application in sequential recommendation remains largely unexplored.This is primarily because mainstream adaptation methods, such as Fine-Tuning and even Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques (e.g., Adapter and LoRA), incur high computational costs, especially when integrating multiple modality encoders, thus hindering research progress.As a result, it remains unclear whether we can efficiently and effectively adapt multiple (>2) MFMs for the sequential recommendation task.   To address this, we propose a plug-and-play Cross-modal Side Adapter Network (CROSSAN).Leveraging the fully decoupled side adapter-based paradigm, CROSSAN achieves high efficiency while enabling cross-modal learning across diverse modalities.To optimize the final stage of multimodal fusion across diverse modalities, we adopt the Mixture of Modality Expert Fusion (MOMEF) mechanism.CROSSAN achieves superior performance on the public datasets for adapting four foundation models with raw modalities.Performance consistently improves as more MFMs are adapted.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We will release our code and datasets to facilitate future research. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.836</span></span></p>

                  <p>An AI system can create and maintain knowledge only to the extent that it can verify that knowledge itself.Recent work on long Chain-of-Thought reasoning has demonstrated great potential of LLMs on solving competitive problems, but their verification ability remains to be weak and not sufficiently investigated.In this paper, we propose Heimdall, the long CoT verification LLM that can accurately judge the correctness of solutions.With pure reinforcement learning, we boost the verification accuracy from 62.5% to 94.5% on competitive math problems.By scaling with repeated sampling, the accuracy further increases to 97.5%.Through human evaluation, Heimdall demonstrates impressive generalization capabilities, successfully detecting most issues in challenging math proofs, the type of which is not included during training.Furthermore, we propose Pessimistic Verification to extend the functionality of Heimdall to scaling up the problem solving.It calls Heimdall to judge the solutions from a solver model and based on the pessimistic principle, selects the most likely correct solution with the least uncertainty.Taking DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B as the solver model, Pessimistic Verification improves the solution accuracy on AIME2025 from 54.2% to 70.0% with 16x compute budget and to 83.3% with more compute budget.With the stronger solver Gemini 2.5 Pro, the score reaches 93.0%.Finally, we prototype an automatic knowledge discovery system, a ternary system where one poses questions, another provides solutions, and the third verifies the solutions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Using the data synthesis work NuminaMath for the first two components, Heimdall effectively identifies problematic records within the dataset and reveals that nearly half of the data is flawed, which interestingly aligns with the recent ablation studies from NuminaMath. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.713</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large-scale pre-trained image-to-3D generative models have exhibited remarkable capabilities in diverse shape generations.However, most of them struggle to synthesize plausible 3D assets when the reference image is flat-colored like hand drawings due to the lack of 3D illusion, which are often the most user-friendly input modalities in art content creation.To this end, we propose Art3D, a training-free method that can lift flat-colored 2D designs into 3D. By leveraging structural and semantic features with pre- trained 2D image generation models and a VLM-based realism evaluation, Art3D successfully enhances the three-dimensional illusion in reference images, thus simplifying the process of generating 3D from 2D, and proves adaptable to a wide range of painting styles.To benchmark the generalization performance of existing image-to-3D models on flat-colored images without 3D feeling, we collect a new dataset, Flat-2D, with over 100 samples.Experimental results demonstrate the performance and robustness of Art3D, exhibiting superior generalizable capacity and promising practical applicability.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our source code and dataset will be publicly available on our project page: https://joy-jy11.github.io/ . <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.905</span></span></p>

                  <p>Controllable scene generation could reduce the cost of diverse data collection substantially for autonomous driving.Prior works formulate the traffic layout generation as predictive progress, either by denoising entire sequences at once or by iteratively predicting the next frame.However, full sequence denoising hinders online reaction, while the latter's short-sighted next-frame prediction lacks precise goal-state guidance.Further, the learned model struggles to generate complex or challenging scenarios due to a large number of safe and ordinal driving behaviors from open datasets.To overcome these, we introduce Nexus, a decoupled scene generation framework that improves reactivity and goal conditioning by simulating both ordinal and challenging scenarios from fine-grained tokens with independent noise states.At the core of the decoupled pipeline is the integration of a partial noise-masking training strategy and a noise-aware schedule that ensures timely environmental updates throughout the denoising process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To complement challenging scenario generation, we collect a dataset consisting of complex corner cases. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.803</span></span>It covers 540 hours of simulated data, including high-risk interactions such as cut-in, sudden braking, and collision.Nexus achieves superior generation realism while preserving reactivity and goal orientation, with a 40% reduction in displacement error.We further demonstrate that Nexus improves closed-loop planning by 20% through data augmentation and showcase its capability in safety-critical data generation.</p>

                  <p>Self-supervised learning (SSL) has enabled the development of vision foundation models for Earth Observation (EO), demonstrating strong transferability across diverse remote sensing tasks.While prior work has focused on network architectures and training strategies, the role of dataset curation, especially in balancing and diversifying pre-training datasets, remains underexplored.In EO, this challenge is amplified by the redundancy and heavy-tailed distributions common in satellite imagery, which can lead to biased representations and inefficient training.   In this work, we propose a dynamic dataset pruning strategy designed to improve SSL pre-training by maximizing dataset diversity and balance.Our method iteratively refines the training set without requiring a pre-existing feature extractor, making it well-suited for domains where curated datasets are limited or unavailable.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We demonstrate our approach on the Sentinel-1 Wave Mode (WV) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) archive, a challenging dataset dominated by ocean observations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.76</span></span>We train models from scratch on the entire Sentinel-1 WV archive spanning 10 years.Across three downstream tasks, our results show that dynamic pruning improves both computational efficiency and representation quality, leading to stronger transferability.

                  <p>While many EDA tasks already involve graph-based data, existing LLMs in EDA primarily either represent graphs as sequential text, or simply ignore graph-structured data that might be beneficial like dataflow graphs of RTL code.Recent studies have found that LLM performance suffers when graphs are represented as sequential text, and using additional graph information significantly boosts performance.To address these challenges, we introduce BRIDGES, a framework designed to incorporate graph modality into LLMs for EDA tasks.BRIDGES integrates an automated data generation workflow, a solution that combines graph modality with LLM, and a comprehensive evaluation suite.First, we establish an LLM-driven workflow to generate RTL and netlist-level data, converting them into dataflow and netlist graphs with function descriptions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This workflow yields a large-scale dataset comprising over 500,000 graph instances and more than 1.5 billion tokens. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.75</span></span>Second, we propose a lightweight cross-modal projector that encodes graph representations into text-compatible prompts, enabling LLMs to effectively utilize graph data without architectural modifications.Experimental results demonstrate 2x to 10x improvements across multiple tasks compared to text-only baselines, including accuracy in design retrieval, type prediction and perplexity in function description, with negligible computational overhead (<1% model weights increase and <30% additional runtime overhead).Even without additional LLM finetuning, our results outperform text-only by a large margin.We plan to release BRIDGES, including the dataset, models, and training flow.</p>

                  <p>Diffusion models are widely used for image editing tasks.Existing editing methods often design a representation manipulation procedure by curating an edit direction in the text embedding or score space.However, such a procedure faces a key challenge: overestimating the edit strength harms visual consistency while underestimating it fails the editing task.Notably, each source image may require a different editing strength, and it is costly to search for an appropriate strength via trial-and-error.To address this challenge, we propose Concept Lancet (CoLan), a zero-shot plug-and-play framework for principled representation manipulation in diffusion-based image editing.At inference time, we decompose the source input in the latent (text embedding or diffusion score) space as a sparse linear combination of the representations of the collected visual concepts.This allows us to accurately estimate the presence of concepts in each image, which informs the edit.Based on the editing task (replace/add/remove), we perform a customized concept transplant process to impose the corresponding editing direction.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To sufficiently model the concept space, we curate a conceptual representation dataset, CoLan-150K, which contains diverse descriptions and scenarios of visual terms and phrases for the latent dictionary. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.742</span></span>Experiments on multiple diffusion-based image editing baselines show that methods equipped with CoLan achieve state-of-the-art performance in editing effectiveness and consistency preservation.</p>

                  <p>Nowadays, developers increasingly rely on solutions powered by Large Language Models (LLM) to assist them with their coding tasks.This makes it crucial to align these tools with human values to prevent malicious misuse.In this paper, we propose a comprehensive framework for assessing the potential harmfulness of LLMs within the software engineering domain.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We begin by developing a taxonomy of potentially harmful software engineering scenarios and subsequently, create a dataset of prompts based on this taxonomy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.762</span></span>To systematically assess the responses, we design and validate an automatic evaluator that classifies the outputs of a variety of LLMs both open-source and closed-source models, as well as general-purpose and code-specific LLMs.Furthermore, we investigate the impact of models size, architecture family, and alignment strategies on their tendency to generate harmful content.The results show significant disparities in the alignment of various LLMs for harmlessness.We find that some models and model families, such as Openhermes, are more harmful than others and that code-specific models do not perform better than their general-purpose counterparts.Notably, some fine-tuned models perform significantly worse than their base-models due to their design choices.On the other side, we find that larger models tend to be more helpful and are less likely to respond with harmful information.These results highlight the importance of targeted alignment strategies tailored to the unique challenges of software engineering tasks and provide a foundation for future work in this critical area.</p>

                  <p>Offline evaluation of recommender systems has traditionally treated the problem as a machine learning problem.In the classic case of recommending movies, where the user has provided explicit ratings of which movies they like and don't like, each user's ratings are split into test and train sets, and the evaluation task becomes to predict the held out test data using the training data.This machine learning style of evaluation makes the objective to recommend the movies that a user has watched and rated highly, which is not the same task as helping the user find movies that they would enjoy if they watched them.This mismatch in objective between evaluation and task is a compromise to avoid the cost of asking a user to evaluate recommendations by watching each movie.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>As a resource available for download, we offer an extension to the MovieLens-32M dataset that provides for new evaluation objectives. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.772</span></span>Our primary objective is to predict the movies that a user would be interested in watching, i.e. predict their watchlist.To construct this extension, we recruited MovieLens users, collected their profiles, made recommendations with a diverse set of algorithms, pooled the recommendations, and had the users assess the pools.Notably, we found that the traditional machine learning style of evaluation ranks the Popular algorithm, which recommends movies based on total number of ratings in the system, in the middle of the twenty-two recommendation runs we used to build the pools.In contrast, when we rank the runs by users' interest in watching movies, we find that recommending popular movies as a recommendation algorithm becomes one of the worst performing runs.It appears that by asking users to assess their personal recommendations, we can alleviate the popularity bias issues created by using information retrieval effectiveness measures for the evaluation of recommender systems.</p>

                  <p>Referring expression segmentation (RES) aims at segmenting the entities' masks that match the descriptive language expression.While traditional RES methods primarily address object-level grounding, real-world scenarios demand a more versatile framework that can handle multiple levels of target granularity, such as multi-object, single object or part-level references.This introduces great challenges due to the diverse and nuanced ways users describe targets.However, existing datasets and models mainly focus on designing grounding specialists for object-level target localization, lacking the necessary data resources and unified frameworks for the more practical multi-grained RES.In this paper, we take a step further towards visual granularity unified RES task.To overcome the limitation of data scarcity, we introduce a new multi-granularity referring expression segmentation (MRES) task, alongside the RefCOCOm benchmark, which includes part-level annotations for advancing finer-grained visual understanding.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, we create MRES-32M, the largest visual grounding dataset, comprising over 32.2M masks and captions across 1M images, specifically designed for part-level vision-language grounding. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.809</span></span>To tackle the challenges of multi-granularity RES, we propose UniRES++, a unified multimodal large language model that integrates object-level and part-level RES tasks.UniRES++ incorporates targeted designs for fine-grained visual feature exploration.With the joint model architecture and parameters, UniRES++ achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, including RefCOCOm for MRES, gRefCOCO for generalized RES, and RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg for classic RES.To foster future research into multi-grained visual grounding, our RefCOCOm benchmark, MRES-32M dataset and model UniRES++ will be publicly available at https://github.com/Rubics-Xuan/MRES.</p>

                  <p>With the release of the o1 model by OpenAI, reasoning models adopting slow thinking strategies have gradually emerged.As the responses generated by such models often include complex reasoning, intermediate steps, and self-reflection, existing evaluation methods are often inadequate.They struggle to determine whether the LLM output is truly equivalent to the reference answer, and also have difficulty identifying and extracting the final answer from long, complex responses.To address this issue, we propose xVerify, an efficient answer verifier for reasoning model evaluations.xVerify demonstrates strong capability in equivalence judgment, enabling it to effectively determine whether the answers produced by reasoning models are equivalent to reference answers across various types of objective questions.To train and evaluate xVerify, we construct the VAR dataset by collecting question-answer pairs generated by multiple LLMs across various datasets, leveraging multiple reasoning models and challenging evaluation sets designed specifically for reasoning model assessment.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A multi-round annotation process is employed to ensure label accuracy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.716</span></span>Based on the VAR dataset, we train multiple xVerify models of different scales.In evaluation experiments conducted on both the test set and generalization set, all xVerify models achieve overall F1 scores and accuracy exceeding 95\%.Notably, the smallest variant, xVerify-0.5B-I, outperforms all evaluation methods except GPT-4o, while xVerify-3B-Ib surpasses GPT-4o in overall performance.These results validate the effectiveness and generalizability of xVerify.</p>

                  <p>Micro-Action Recognition (MAR) aims to classify subtle human actions in video.However, annotating MAR datasets is particularly challenging due to the subtlety of actions.To this end, we introduce the setting of Semi-Supervised MAR (SSMAR), where only a part of samples are labeled.We first evaluate traditional Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods to SSMAR and find that these methods tend to overfit on inaccurate pseudo-labels, leading to error accumulation and degraded performance.This issue primarily arises from the common practice of directly using the predictions of classifier as pseudo-labels to train the model.To solve this issue, we propose a novel framework, called Asynchronous Pseudo Labeling and Training (APLT), which explicitly separates the pseudo-labeling process from model training.Specifically, we introduce a semi-supervised clustering method during the offline pseudo-labeling phase to generate more accurate pseudo-labels.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, a self-adaptive thresholding strategy is proposed to dynamically filter noisy labels of different classes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.657</span></span>We then build a memory-based prototype classifier based on the filtered pseudo-labels, which is fixed and used to guide the subsequent model training phase.By alternating the two pseudo-labeling and model training phases in an asynchronous manner, the model can not only be learned with more accurate pseudo-labels but also avoid the overfitting issue.Experiments on three MAR datasets show that our APLT largely outperforms state-of-the-art SSL methods.For instance, APLT improves accuracy by 14.5\% over FixMatch on the MA-12 dataset when using only 50\% labeled data.Code will be publicly available.</p>

                  <p>Microarchitectural attacks are a significant concern, leading to many hardware-based defense proposals.However, different defenses target different classes of attacks, and their impact on each other has not been fully considered.To raise awareness of this problem, we study an interaction between two state-of-the art defenses in this paper, timing obfuscations of remote cache lines (TORC) and delaying speculative changes to remote cache lines (DSRC).TORC mitigates cache-hit based attacks and DSRC mitigates speculative coherence state change attacks.   We observe that DSRC enables coherence information to be retrieved into the processor core, where it is out of the reach of timing obfuscations to protect.This creates an unforeseen consequence that redo operations can be triggered within the core to detect the presence or absence of remote cache lines, which constitutes a security vulnerability.We demonstrate that a new covert channel attack is possible using this vulnerability.We propose two ways to mitigate the attack, whose performance varies depending on an application's cache usage.One way is to never send remote exclusive coherence state (E) information to the core even if it is created.The other way is to never create a remote E state, which is responsible for triggering redos.   We demonstrate the timing difference caused by this microarchitectural defense assumption violation using GEM5 simulations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Performance evaluation on SPECrate 2017 and PARSEC benchmarks of the two fixes show less than 32\% average overhead across both sets of benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.712</span></span>The repair which prevented the creation of remote E state had less than 2.8% average overhead.</p>

                  <p>Reinforcement Learning from Human/AI Feedback (RLHF/RLAIF) has been extensively utilized for preference alignment of text-to-image models.Existing methods face certain limitations in terms of both data and algorithm.For training data, most approaches rely on manual annotated preference data, either by directly fine-tuning the generators or by training reward models to provide training signals.However, the high annotation cost makes them difficult to scale up, the reward model consumes extra computation and cannot guarantee accuracy.From an algorithmic perspective, most methods neglect the value of text and only take the image feedback as a comparative signal, which is inefficient and sparse.To alleviate these drawbacks, we propose the InstructEngine framework.Regarding annotation cost, we first construct a taxonomy for text-to-image generation, then develop an automated data construction pipeline based on it.Leveraging advanced large multimodal models and human-defined rules, we generate 25K text-image preference pairs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we introduce cross-validation alignment method, which refines data efficiency by organizing semantically analogous samples into mutually comparable pairs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span>Evaluations on DrawBench demonstrate that InstructEngine improves SD v1.5 and SDXL's performance by 10.53% and 5.30%, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines, with ablation study confirming the benefits of InstructEngine's all components.A win rate of over 50% in human reviews also proves that InstructEngine better aligns with human preferences.</p>

                  <p>Autonomous fabrication systems are transforming construction and manufacturing, yet they remain vulnerable to print errors.Texture classification is a key component of computer vision systems that enable real-time monitoring and adjustment during cementitious fabrication.Traditional classification methods often rely on global image features, which can bias the model toward semantic content rather than low-level textures.In this paper, we introduce a novel preprocessing technique called "patch and shuffle," which segments input images into smaller patches, shuffles them, and reconstructs a jumbled image before classification.This transformation removes semantic context, forcing the classifier to rely on local texture features.   We evaluate this approach on a dataset of extruded cement images, using a ResNet-18-based architecture.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experiments compare the patch and shuffle method to a standard pipeline, holding all other factors constant. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.623</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Results show a significant improvement in accuracy: the patch and shuffle model achieved 90.64% test accuracy versus 72.46% for the baseline. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.713</span></span>These findings suggest that disrupting global structure enhances performance in texture-based classification tasks.

                  <p>We present a silent, self-stabilizing ranking protocol for the population protocol model of distributed computing, where agents interact in randomly chosen pairs to solve a common task.We are given $n$ anonymous agents, and the goal is to assign each agent a unique rank in $\{1, \dots, n\}$. Given unique ranks, it is straightforward to select a designated leader.Thus, our protocol is a self-stabilizing leader election protocol as well.Ranking requires at least $n$ states per agent; hence, the goal is to minimize the additional number of states, called overhead states.The core of our protocol is a space-efficient but non-self-stabilizing ranking protocol that requires only $n + O(\log n)$ states.Our protocol stabilizes in $O(n^2\log n)$ interactions w.h.p.\ and in expectation, using $n + O(\log^2 n)$ states in total.Our stabilization time is asymptotically optimal (see Burman et al., PODC'21).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In comparison to the currently best known ranking protocol by Burman et al., which requires $n + \Omega(n)$ states, our result exponentially improves the number of overhead states. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span></p>

                  <p>The age of incorrect information (AoII) process which keeps track of the time since the source and monitor processes are in sync, has been extensively used in remote estimation problems.In this paper, we consider a push-based remote estimation system with a discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC) information source transmitting status update packets towards the monitor once the AoII process exceeds a certain estimation-based threshold.In this paper, the time average of an arbitrary function of AoII is taken as the AoII cost, as opposed to using the average AoII as the mismatch metric, whereas this function is also allowed to depend on the estimation value.In this very general setting, our goal is to minimize a weighted sum of AoII and transmission costs.For this purpose, we formulate a discrete-time semi-Markov decision process (SMDP) regarding the multi-threshold status update policy.We propose a novel tool in discrete-time called 'dual-regime absorbing Markov chain' (DR-AMC) and its corresponding absorption time distribution named as 'dual-regime phase-type' (DR-PH) distribution, to obtain the characterizing parameters of the SMDP, which allows us to obtain the distribution of the AoII process for a given policy, and hence the average of any function of AoII.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The proposed method is validated with numerical results by which we compare our proposed method against other policies obtained by exhaustive-search, and also various benchmark policies. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.729</span></span></p>

                  <p>Micro-Action Recognition (MAR) aims to classify subtle human actions in video.However, annotating MAR datasets is particularly challenging due to the subtlety of actions.To this end, we introduce the setting of Semi-Supervised MAR (SSMAR), where only a part of samples are labeled.We first evaluate traditional Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods to SSMAR and find that these methods tend to overfit on inaccurate pseudo-labels, leading to error accumulation and degraded performance.This issue primarily arises from the common practice of directly using the predictions of classifier as pseudo-labels to train the model.To solve this issue, we propose a novel framework, called Asynchronous Pseudo Labeling and Training (APLT), which explicitly separates the pseudo-labeling process from model training.Specifically, we introduce a semi-supervised clustering method during the offline pseudo-labeling phase to generate more accurate pseudo-labels.Moreover, a self-adaptive thresholding strategy is proposed to dynamically filter noisy labels of different classes.We then build a memory-based prototype classifier based on the filtered pseudo-labels, which is fixed and used to guide the subsequent model training phase.By alternating the two pseudo-labeling and model training phases in an asynchronous manner, the model can not only be learned with more accurate pseudo-labels but also avoid the overfitting issue.Experiments on three MAR datasets show that our APLT largely outperforms state-of-the-art SSL methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For instance, APLT improves accuracy by 14.5\% over FixMatch on the MA-12 dataset when using only 50\% labeled data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span>Code will be publicly available.</p>

                  <p>Images captured under low-light conditions present significant limitations in many applications, as poor lighting can obscure details, reduce contrast, and hide noise.Removing the illumination effects and enhancing the quality of such images is crucial for many tasks, such as image segmentation and object detection.In this paper, we propose a variational method for low-light image enhancement based on the Retinex decomposition into illumination, reflectance, and noise components.A color correction pre-processing step is applied to the low-light image, which is then used as the observed input in the decomposition.Moreover, our model integrates a novel nonlocal gradient-type fidelity term designed to preserve structural details.Additionally, we propose an automatic gamma correction module.Building on the proposed variational approach, we extend the model by introducing its deep unfolding counterpart, in which the proximal operators are replaced with learnable networks.We propose cross-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies in both the nonlocal prior of the reflectance and the nonlocal gradient-based constraint.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results demonstrate that both methods compare favorably with several recent and state-of-the-art techniques across different datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.708</span></span>In particular, despite not relying on learning strategies, the variational model outperforms most deep learning approaches both visually and in terms of quality metrics.</p>

                  <p>Common-sense reasoning is a key language model capability because it encapsulates not just specific factual knowledge but rather general language and world understanding.Measuring common-sense reasoning, therefore, is crucial for language models of different sizes and applications.One of the most widely used benchmarks for evaluating such capabilities is HellaSwag; however, in this paper, we show that it has severe construct validity issues.These issues range from basic ungrammaticality and numerous typos to misleading prompts or equally correct options.Furthermore, we show that if models are evaluated only on answer texts, or with "Lorem ipsum dolor..." instead of the question, more than 65% of model predictions remain the same, and this cannot be attributed merely to contamination.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Since benchmark scores are an essential part of model selection in both research and commercial applications, these validity issues can have severe consequences. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.684</span></span>In particular, knowing that taking benchmark scores at face value is ubiquitous, inadequate evaluation leads to ill-informed decisions about models.In this paper, we thoroughly investigate critical validity issues posed by HellaSwag and illustrate them with various evaluations using generative language models of different sizes.We argue that this benchmark does not accurately measure common-sense reasoning and, therefore, should not be used for evaluation in its current state.Based on the results of our study, we propose requirements that should be met by future common-sense reasoning benchmarks.In addition, we release GoldenSwag, a corrected subset of HellaSwag, which, to our belief, facilitates acceptable common-sense reasoning evaluation.</p>

                  <p>Light field microscopy (LFM) has gained significant attention due to its ability to capture snapshot-based, large-scale 3D fluorescence images.However, existing LFM reconstruction algorithms are highly sensitive to sensor noise or require hard-to-get ground-truth annotated data for training.To address these challenges, this paper introduces V2V3D, an unsupervised view2view-based framework that establishes a new paradigm for joint optimization of image denoising and 3D reconstruction in a unified architecture.We assume that the LF images are derived from a consistent 3D signal, with the noise in each view being independent.This enables V2V3D to incorporate the principle of noise2noise for effective denoising.To enhance the recovery of high-frequency details, we propose a novel wave-optics-based feature alignment technique, which transforms the point spread function, used for forward propagation in wave optics, into convolution kernels specifically designed for feature alignment.Moreover, we introduce an LFM dataset containing LF images and their corresponding 3D intensity volumes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves high computational efficiency and outperforms the other state-of-the-art methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.708</span></span>These advancements position V2V3D as a promising solution for 3D imaging under challenging conditions.</p>

                  <p>Recent advances in inference-time compute have significantly improved performance on complex tasks by generating long chains of thought (CoTs) using Large Reasoning Models (LRMs).However, this improved accuracy comes at the cost of high inference latency due to the length of generated reasoning sequences and the autoregressive nature of decoding.Our key insight in tackling these overheads is that LRM inference, and the reasoning that it embeds, is highly tolerant of approximations: complex tasks are typically broken down into simpler steps, each of which brings utility based on the semantic insight it provides for downstream steps rather than the exact tokens it generates.Accordingly, we introduce SpecReason, a system that automatically accelerates LRM inference by using a lightweight model to (speculatively) carry out simpler intermediate reasoning steps and reserving the costly base model only to assess (and potentially correct) the speculated outputs.Importantly, SpecReason's focus on exploiting the semantic flexibility of thinking tokens in preserving final-answer accuracy is complementary to prior speculation techniques, most notably speculative decoding, which demands token-level equivalence at each step.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Across a variety of reasoning benchmarks, SpecReason achieves 1.5-2.5$\times$ speedup over vanilla LRM inference while improving accuracy by 1.0-9.9\%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.648</span></span>Compared to speculative decoding without SpecReason, their combination yields an additional 19.4-44.2\% latency reduction.We open-source SpecReason at https://github.com/ruipeterpan/specreason.</p>

                  <p>Tree-based models are often robust to uninformative features and can accurately capture non-smooth, complex decision boundaries.Consequently, they often outperform neural network-based models on tabular datasets at a significantly lower computational cost.Nevertheless, the capability of traditional tree-based ensembles to express complex relationships efficiently is limited by using a single feature to make splits.To improve the efficiency and expressiveness of tree-based methods, we propose Random Oblique Fast Interpretable Greedy-Tree Sums (RO-FIGS).RO-FIGS builds on Fast Interpretable Greedy-Tree Sums, and extends it by learning trees with oblique or multivariate splits, where each split consists of a linear combination learnt from random subsets of features.This helps uncover interactions between features and improves performance.The proposed method is suitable for tabular datasets with both numerical and categorical features.We evaluate RO-FIGS on 22 real-world tabular datasets, demonstrating superior performance and much smaller models over other tree- and neural network-based methods.Additionally, we analyse their splits to reveal valuable insights into feature interactions, enriching the information learnt from SHAP summary plots, and thereby demonstrating the enhanced interpretability of RO-FIGS models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The proposed method is well-suited for applications, where balance between accuracy and interpretability is essential. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.617</span></span></p>

                  <p>Performance gap across classes remains a persistent challenge in machine learning, often attributed to variations in class hardness.One way to quantify class hardness is through sample complexity - the minimum number of samples required to effectively learn a given class.Sample complexity theory suggests that class hardness is driven by differences in the amount of data required for generalization.That is, harder classes need substantially more samples to achieve generalization.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Therefore, hardness-based resampling is a promising approach to mitigate these performance disparities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span>While resampling has been studied extensively in data-imbalanced settings, its impact on balanced datasets remains unexplored.   This raises the fundamental question whether resampling is effective because it addresses data imbalance or hardness imbalance.We begin addressing this question by introducing class imbalance into balanced datasets and evaluate its effect on performance disparities.We oversample hard classes and undersample easy classes to bring hard classes closer to their sample complexity requirements while maintaining a constant dataset size for fairness.We estimate class-level hardness using the Area Under the Margin (AUM) hardness estimator and leverage it to compute resampling ratios.Using these ratios, we perform hardness-based resampling on the well-known CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets.   Contrary to theoretical expectations, our results show that hardness-based resampling does not meaningfully affect class-wise performance disparities.To explain this discrepancy, we conduct detailed analyses to identify key challenges unique to hardness-based imbalance, distinguishing it from traditional data-based imbalance.Our insights help explain why theoretical sample complexity expectations fail to translate into practical performance gains and we provide guidelines for future research.</p>

                  <p>Reasoning has emerged as the next major frontier for language models (LMs), with rapid advances from both academic and industrial labs.However, this progress often outpaces methodological rigor, with many evaluations relying on benchmarking practices that lack transparency, robustness, or statistical grounding.In this work, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study and find that current mathematical reasoning benchmarks are highly sensitive to subtle implementation choices - including decoding parameters, random seeds, prompt formatting, and even hardware and software-framework configurations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Performance gains reported in recent studies frequently hinge on unclear comparisons or unreported sources of variance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.619</span></span>To address these issues, we propose a standardized evaluation framework with clearly defined best practices and reporting standards.Using this framework, we reassess recent methods and find that reinforcement learning (RL) approaches yield only modest improvements - far below prior claims - and are prone to overfitting, especially on small-scale benchmarks like AIME24.In contrast, supervised finetuning (SFT) methods show consistently stronger generalization.To foster reproducibility, we release all code, prompts, and model outputs, for reasoning benchmarks, establishing more rigorous foundations for future work.</p>

                  <p>Recent advances in video generation have posed great challenges in the assessment of AI-generated content, particularly with the emergence of increasingly sophisticated models.The various inconsistencies and defects observed in such videos are inherently complex, making overall scoring notoriously difficult.In this paper, we emphasize the critical importance of integrating fine-grained reasoning into video evaluation, and we propose $\textbf{F}$ing$\textbf{ER}$, a novel entity-level reasoning evaluation framework that first automatically generates $\textbf{F}$ine-grained $\textbf{E}$ntity-level questions, and then answers those questions by a $\textbf{R}$easoning model with scores, which can be subsequently weighted summed to an overall score for different applications.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, we leverage LLMs to derive entity-level questions across five distinct perspectives, which (i) often focus on some specific entities of the content, thereby making answering or scoring much easier by MLLMs, and (ii) are more interpretable. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.674</span></span>Then we construct a FingER dataset, consisting of approximately 3.3k videos and corresponding 60k fine-grained QA annotations, each with detailed reasons.Based on that, we further investigate various training protocols to best incentivize the reasoning capability of MLLMs for correct answer prediction.Extensive experiments demonstrate that a reasoning model trained using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a cold-start strategy achieves the best performance.Notably, our model surpasses existing methods by a relative margin of $11.8\%$ on GenAI-Bench and $5.5\%$ on MonetBench with only 3.3k training videos, which is at most one-tenth of the training samples utilized by other methods.Our code and dataset will be released soon.</p>

                  <p>Scientific equation discovery is a fundamental task in the history of scientific progress, enabling the derivation of laws governing natural phenomena.Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained interest for this task due to their potential to leverage embedded scientific knowledge for hypothesis generation.However, evaluating the true discovery capabilities of these methods remains challenging, as existing benchmarks often rely on common equations that are susceptible to memorization by LLMs, leading to inflated performance metrics that do not reflect discovery.In this paper, we introduce LLM-SRBench, a comprehensive benchmark with 239 challenging problems across four scientific domains specifically designed to evaluate LLM-based scientific equation discovery methods while preventing trivial memorization.Our benchmark comprises two main categories: LSR-Transform, which transforms common physical models into less common mathematical representations to test reasoning beyond memorized forms, and LSR-Synth, which introduces synthetic, discovery-driven problems requiring data-driven reasoning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through extensive evaluation of several state-of-the-art methods, using both open and closed LLMs, we find that the best-performing system so far achieves only 31.5% symbolic accuracy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.638</span></span>These findings highlight the challenges of scientific equation discovery, positioning LLM-SRBench as a valuable resource for future research.</p>

                  <p>Modern code generation has made significant strides in functional correctness and execution efficiency.However, these systems often overlook a critical dimension in real-world software development: maintainability.To handle dynamic requirements with minimal rework, we propose MaintainCoder as a pioneering solution.It integrates Waterfall model, design patterns, and multi-agent collaboration to systematically enhance cohesion, reduce coupling, and improve adaptability.We also introduce MaintainBench, a benchmark comprising requirement changes and corresponding dynamic metrics on maintainance effort.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments demonstrate that existing code generation methods struggle to meet maintainability standards when requirements evolve. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.622</span></span>In contrast, MaintainCoder improves maintainability metrics by 14-30% with even higher correctness, i.e. pass@k.Our work not only provides the foundation of maintainable code generation, but also highlights the need for more holistic code quality research.Resources: https://github.com/IAAR-Shanghai/MaintainCoder.</p>
