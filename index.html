                  <p>Transformer-based models have revolutionized the field of natural language processing.To understand why they perform so well and to assess their reliability, several studies have focused on questions such as: Which linguistic properties are encoded by these models, and to what extent?How robust are these models in encoding linguistic properties when faced with perturbations in the input text?However, these studies have mainly focused on BERT and the English language.In this paper, we investigate similar questions regarding encoding capability and robustness for 8 linguistic properties across 13 different perturbations in 6 Indic languages, using 9 multilingual Transformer models (7 universal and 2 Indic-specific).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To conduct this study, we introduce a novel multilingual benchmark dataset, IndicSentEval, containing approximately $\sim$47K sentences. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.837</span></span>Surprisingly, our probing analysis of surface, syntactic, and semantic properties reveals that while almost all multilingual models demonstrate consistent encoding performance for English, they show mixed results for Indic languages.As expected, Indic-specific multilingual models capture linguistic properties in Indic languages better than universal models.Intriguingly, universal models broadly exhibit better robustness compared to Indic-specific models, particularly under perturbations such as dropping both nouns and verbs, dropping only verbs, or keeping only nouns.Overall, this study provides valuable insights into probing and perturbation-specific strengths and weaknesses of popular multilingual Transformer-based models for different Indic languages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We make our code and dataset publicly available [https://tinyurl.com/IndicSentEval}]. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.845</span></span></p>

                  <p>To make large language models (LLMs) more helpful across diverse cultures, it is essential to have effective cultural knowledge benchmarks to measure and track our progress.Effective benchmarks need to be robust, diverse, and challenging.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We introduce CulturalBench: a set of 1,227 human-written and human-verified questions for effectively assessing LLMs' cultural knowledge, covering 45 global regions including the underrepresented ones like Bangladesh, Zimbabwe, and Peru. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.757</span></span>Questions - each verified by five independent annotators - span 17 diverse topics ranging from food preferences to greeting etiquettes.We evaluate models on two setups: CulturalBench-Easy and CulturalBench-Hard which share the same questions but asked differently.We find that LLMs are sensitive to such difference in setups (e.g., GPT-4o with 27.3% difference).Compared to human performance (92.6% accuracy), CulturalBench-Hard is more challenging for frontier LLMs with the best performing model (GPT-4o) at only 61.5% and the worst (Llama3-8b) at 21.4%.Moreover, we find that LLMs often struggle with tricky questions that have multiple correct answers (e.g., What utensils do the Chinese usually use?), revealing a tendency to converge to a single answer.Our results also indicate that OpenAI GPT-4o substantially outperform other proprietary and open source models in questions related to all but one region (Oceania).Nonetheless, all models consistently underperform on questions related to South America and the Middle East.</p>

                  <p>There has been growing sentiment recently that modern large multimodal models (LMMs) have addressed most of the key challenges related to short video comprehension.As a result, both academia and industry are gradually shifting their attention towards the more complex challenges posed by understanding long-form videos.However, is this really the case?Our studies indicate that LMMs still lack many fundamental reasoning capabilities even when dealing with short videos.We introduce Vinoground, a temporal counterfactual LMM evaluation benchmark encompassing 1000 short and natural video-caption pairs.We demonstrate that existing LMMs severely struggle to distinguish temporal differences between different actions and object transformations.For example, the best model GPT-4o only obtains ~50% on our text and video scores, showing a large gap compared to the human baseline of ~90%.All open-source multimodal models and CLIP-based models perform much worse, producing mostly random chance performance.Through this work, we shed light onto the fact that temporal reasoning in short videos is a problem yet to be fully solved.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset and evaluation code are available at https://vinoground.github.io. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.794</span></span></p>

                  <p>The stark contrast in the design philosophy of an event camera makes it particularly ideal for operating under high-speed, high dynamic range and low-light conditions, where standard cameras underperform.Nonetheless, event cameras still suffer from some amount of motion blur, especially under these challenging conditions, in contrary to what most think.This is attributed to the limited bandwidth of the event sensor pixel, which is mostly proportional to the light intensity.Thus, to ensure that event cameras can truly excel in such conditions where it has an edge over standard cameras, it is crucial to account for event motion blur in downstream applications, especially reconstruction.However, none of the recent works on reconstructing Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) from events, nor event simulators, have considered the full effects of event motion blur.To this end, we propose, Deblur e-NeRF, a novel method to directly and effectively reconstruct blur-minimal NeRFs from motion-blurred events generated under high-speed motion or low-light conditions.The core component of this work is a physically-accurate pixel bandwidth model proposed to account for event motion blur under arbitrary speed and lighting conditions.We also introduce a novel threshold-normalized total variation loss to improve the regularization of large textureless patches.Experiments on real and novel realistically simulated sequences verify our effectiveness.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code, event simulator and synthetic event dataset will be open-sourced. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.843</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent advances in Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have demonstrated their great potential in general-purpose video understanding.To verify the significance of these models, a number of benchmarks have been proposed to diagnose their capabilities in different scenarios.However, existing benchmarks merely evaluate models through video-level question-answering, lacking fine-grained event-level assessment and task diversity.To fill this gap, we introduce E.T. Bench (Event-Level & Time-Sensitive Video Understanding Benchmark), a large-scale and high-quality benchmark for open-ended event-level video understanding.Categorized within a 3-level task taxonomy, E.T. Bench encompasses 7.3K samples under 12 tasks with 7K videos (251.4h total length) under 8 domains, providing comprehensive evaluations.We extensively evaluated 8 Image-LLMs and 12 Video-LLMs on our benchmark, and the results reveal that state-of-the-art models for coarse-level (video-level) understanding struggle to solve our fine-grained tasks, e.g., grounding event-of-interests within videos, largely due to the short video context length, improper time representations, and lack of multi-event training data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Focusing on these issues, we further propose a strong baseline model, E.T.

                  <p>Event cameras are bio-inspired sensors that capture the intensity changes asynchronously and output event streams with distinct advantages, such as high temporal resolution.To exploit event cameras for object/action recognition, existing methods predominantly sample and aggregate events in a second-level duration at every fixed temporal interval (or frequency).However, they often face difficulties in capturing the spatiotemporal relationships for longer, e.g., minute-level, events and generalizing across varying temporal frequencies.To fill the gap, we present a novel framework, dubbed PAST-SSM, exhibiting superior capacity in recognizing events with arbitrary duration (e.g., 0.1s to 4.5s) and generalizing to varying inference frequencies.Our key insight is to learn the spatiotemporal relationships from the encoded event features via the state space model (SSM) -- whose linear complexity makes it ideal for modeling high temporal resolution events with longer sequences.To achieve this goal, we first propose a Path-Adaptive Event Aggregation and Scan (PEAS) module to encode events of varying duration into features with fixed dimensions by adaptively scanning and selecting aggregated event frames.On top of PEAS, we introduce a novel Multi-faceted Selection Guiding (MSG) loss to minimize the randomness and redundancy of the encoded features.This subtly enhances the model generalization across different inference frequencies.Lastly, the SSM is employed to better learn the spatiotemporal properties from the encoded features.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, we build a minute-level event-based recognition dataset, named ArDVS100, with arbitrary duration for the benefit of the community. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.778</span></span>Extensive experiments prove that our method outperforms prior arts by +3.45%, +0.38% and +8.31% on the DVS Action, SeAct and HARDVS datasets, respectively.</p>

                  <p>Large language model pre-training has traditionally relied on human experts to craft heuristics for improving the corpora quality, resulting in numerous rules developed to date.However, these rules lack the flexibility to address the unique characteristics of individual example effectively.Meanwhile, applying tailored rules to every example is impractical for human experts.In this paper, we demonstrate that even small language models, with as few as 0.3B parameters, can exhibit substantial data refining capabilities comparable to those of human experts.We introduce Programming Every Example (ProX), a novel framework that treats data refinement as a programming task, enabling models to refine corpora by generating and executing fine-grained operations, such as string normalization, for each individual example at scale.Experimental results show that models pre-trained on ProX-curated data outperform either original data or data filtered by other selection methods by more than 2% across various downstream benchmarks.Its effectiveness spans various model sizes and pre-training corpora, including C4, RedPajama-V2, and FineWeb.Furthermore, ProX exhibits significant potential in domain-specific continual pre-training: without domain specific design, models trained on OpenWebMath refined by ProX outperform human-crafted rule-based methods, improving average accuracy by 7.6% over Mistral-7B, with 14.6% for Llama-2-7B and 20.3% for CodeLlama-7B, all within 10B tokens to be comparable to models like Llemma-7B trained on 200B tokens.Further analysis highlights that ProX significantly saves training FLOPs, offering a promising path for efficient LLM pre-training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We are open-sourcing ProX with >100B corpus, models, and sharing all training and implementation details for reproducible research and future innovation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.76</span></span>Code: https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/ProX</p>

                  <p>The various limitations of Generative AI, such as hallucinations and model failures, have made it crucial to understand the role of different modalities in Visual Language Model (VLM) predictions.Our work investigates how the integration of information from image and text modalities influences the performance and behavior of VLMs in visual question answering (VQA) and reasoning tasks.We measure this effect through answer accuracy, reasoning quality, model uncertainty, and modality relevance.We study the interplay between text and image modalities in different configurations where visual content is essential for solving the VQA task.Our contributions include (1) the Semantic Interventions (SI)-VQA dataset, (2) a benchmark study of various VLM architectures under different modality configurations, and (3) the Interactive Semantic Interventions (ISI) tool.The SI-VQA dataset serves as the foundation for the benchmark, while the ISI tool provides an interface to test and apply semantic interventions in image and text inputs, enabling more fine-grained analysis.Our results show that complementary information between modalities improves answer and reasoning quality, while contradictory information harms model performance and confidence.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Image text annotations have minimal impact on accuracy and uncertainty, slightly increasing image relevance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span>Attention analysis confirms the dominant role of image inputs over text in VQA tasks.In this study, we evaluate state-of-the-art VLMs that allow us to extract attention coefficients for each modality.A key finding is PaliGemma's harmful overconfidence, which poses a higher risk of silent failures compared to the LLaVA models.This work sets the foundation for rigorous analysis of modality integration, supported by datasets specifically designed for this purpose.</p>

                  <p>Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) struggles with sample inefficiency and poor generalization[1].These challenges are partially due to a lack of structure or inductive bias in the neural networks typically used in learning the policy.One such form of structure that is commonly observed in multi-agent scenarios is symmetry.The field of Geometric Deep Learning has developed Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (EGNN) that are equivariant (or symmetric) to rotations, translations, and reflections of nodes.Incorporating equivariance has been shown to improve learning efficiency and decrease error [ 2 ].In this paper, we demonstrate that EGNNs improve the sample efficiency and generalization in MARL.However, we also show that a naive application of EGNNs to MARL results in poor early exploration due to a bias in the EGNN structure.To mitigate this bias, we present Exploration-enhanced Equivariant Graph Neural Networks or E2GN2.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We compare E2GN2 to other common function approximators using common MARL benchmarks MPE and SMACv2. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.704</span></span>E2GN2 demonstrates a significant improvement in sample efficiency, greater final reward convergence, and a 2x-5x gain in over standard GNNs in our generalization tests.These results pave the way for more reliable and effective solutions in complex multi-agent systems.</p>

                  <p>Cellular automata have become a cornerstone for investigating emergence and self-organization across diverse scientific disciplines, spanning neuroscience, artificial life, and theoretical physics.However, the absence of a hardware-accelerated cellular automata library limits the exploration of new research directions, hinders collaboration, and impedes reproducibility.In this work, we introduce CAX (Cellular Automata Accelerated in JAX), a high-performance and flexible open-source library designed to accelerate cellular automata research.CAX offers cutting-edge performance and a modular design through a user-friendly interface, and can support both discrete and continuous cellular automata with any number of dimensions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We demonstrate CAX's performance and flexibility through a wide range of benchmarks and applications. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span>From classic models like elementary cellular automata and Conway's Game of Life to advanced applications such as growing neural cellular automata and self-classifying MNIST digits, CAX speeds up simulations up to 2,000 times faster.Furthermore, we demonstrate CAX's potential to accelerate research by presenting a collection of three novel cellular automata experiments, each implemented in just a few lines of code thanks to the library's modular architecture.Notably, we show that a simple one-dimensional cellular automaton can outperform GPT-4 on the 1D-ARC challenge.</p>

                  <p>There have been many benchmarks for evaluating long-context language models (LCLMs), but developers often rely on synthetic tasks like needle-in-a-haystack (NIAH) or arbitrary subsets of tasks.It remains unclear whether they translate to the diverse downstream applications of LCLMs, and the inconsistency further complicates model comparison.We investigate the underlying reasons behind current practices and find that existing benchmarks often provide noisy signals due to low coverage of applications, insufficient lengths, unreliable metrics, and incompatibility with base models.In this work, we present HELMET (How to Evaluate Long-context Models Effectively and Thoroughly), a comprehensive benchmark encompassing seven diverse, application-centric categories.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also address many issues in previous benchmarks by adding controllable lengths up to 128k tokens, model-based evaluation for reliable metrics, and few-shot prompting for robustly evaluating base models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span>Consequently, we demonstrate that HELMET offers more reliable and consistent rankings of frontier LCLMs.Through a comprehensive study of 51 LCLMs, we find that (1) synthetic tasks like NIAH are not good predictors of downstream performance; (2) the diverse categories in HELMET exhibit distinct trends and low correlation with each other; and (3) while most LCLMs achieve perfect NIAH scores, open-source models significantly lag behind closed ones when the task requires full-context reasoning or following complex instructions -- the gap widens with increased lengths.Finally, we recommend using our RAG tasks for fast model development, as they are easy to run and more predictive of other downstream performance; ultimately, we advocate for a holistic evaluation across diverse tasks.</p>

                  <p>Software engineers mainly write code by editing existing programs.In contrast, large language models (LLMs) autoregressively synthesize programs in a single pass.One explanation for this is the scarcity of open-sourced edit data.While high-quality instruction data for code synthesis is already scarce, high-quality edit data is even scarcer.To fill this gap, we develop a synthetic data generation algorithm called LintSeq.This algorithm refactors existing code into a sequence of code edits by using a linter to procedurally sample across the error-free insertions that can be used to sequentially write programs.It outputs edit sequences as text strings consisting of consecutive program diffs.To test LintSeq, we use it to refactor a dataset of instruction + program pairs into instruction + program-diff-sequence tuples.Then, we instruction finetune a series of smaller LLMs ranging from 2.6B to 14B parameters on both the re-factored and original versions of this dataset, comparing zero-shot performance on code synthesis benchmarks.We show that during repeated sampling, edit sequence finetuned models produce more diverse programs than baselines.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This results in better inference-time scaling for benchmark coverage as a function of samples, i.e. the fraction of problems "pass@k" solved by any attempt given "k" tries. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.63</span></span>For example, on HumanEval pass@50, small LLMs finetuned on synthetic edit sequences are competitive with GPT-4 and outperform models finetuned on the baseline dataset by +20% (+/-3%) in absolute score.Finally, we also pretrain our own tiny LMs for code understanding.We show that finetuning tiny models on synthetic code edits results in state-of-the-art code synthesis for the on-device model class.Our 150M parameter edit sequence LM matches or outperforms code models with twice as many parameters, both with and without repeated sampling, including Codex and AlphaCode.</p>

Here we present a GROMACS implementation of a rigorous Hamiltonian interpolation $\lambda$-dynamics constant pH method, which rests on GPU-accelerated Fast Multipole Method (FMM) electrostatics.Our implementation supports both CHARMM36m and Amber99sb*-ILDN force fields and is largely automated to enable seamless switching from regular MD to constant pH MD, involving minimal changes to the input files.Here, the first of two companion papers describes the underlying constant pH protocol and sample applications to several prototypical benchmark systems such as cardiotoxin V, lysozyme, and staphylococcal nuclease.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Enhanced convergence is achieved through a new dynamic barrier height optimization method, and high p$K_a$ accuracy is demonstrated. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.654</span></span>We use Functional Mode Analysis and Mutual Information to explore the complex intra- and intermolecular couplings between the protonation states of titratable groups as well as those between protonation states and conformational dynamics.We identify striking conformation-dependent p$K_a$ variations and unexpected inter-residue couplings.Conformation-protonation coupling is identified as a primary cause of the slow protonation convergence notorious to constant pH simulations involving multiple titratable groups, suggesting enhanced sampling methods to accelerate convergence.</p>

                  <p>The secretary problem is one of the fundamental problems in online decision making; a tight competitive ratio for this problem of $1/\mathrm{e} \approx 0.368$ has been known since the 1960s.Much more recently, the study of algorithms with predictions was introduced: The algorithm is equipped with a (possibly erroneous) additional piece of information upfront which can be used to improve the algorithm's performance.Complementing previous work on secretary problems with prior knowledge, we tackle the following question:   What is the weakest piece of information that allows us to break the $1/\mathrm{e}$ barrier?   To this end, we introduce the secretary problem with predicted additive gap.As in the classical problem, weights are fixed by an adversary and elements appear in random order.In contrast to previous variants of predictions, our algorithm only has access to a much weaker piece of information: an \emph{additive gap} $c$. This gap is the difference between the highest and $k$-th highest weight in the sequence.Unlike previous pieces of advice, knowing an exact additive gap does not make the problem trivial.Our contribution is twofold.First, we show that for any index $k$ and any gap $c$, we can obtain a competitive ratio of $0.4$ when knowing the exact gap (even if we do not know $k$), hence beating the prevalent bound for the classical problem by a constant.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Second, a slightly modified version of our algorithm allows to prove standard robustness-consistency properties as well as improved guarantees when knowing a range for the error of the prediction. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.63</span></span></p>

                  <p>This paper reformulates cross-dataset human pose estimation as a continual learning task, aiming to integrate new keypoints and pose variations into existing models without losing accuracy on previously learned datasets.We benchmark this formulation against established regularization-based methods for mitigating catastrophic forgetting, including EWC, LFL, and LwF.Moreover, we propose a novel regularization method called Importance-Weighted Distillation (IWD), which enhances conventional LwF by introducing a layer-wise distillation penalty and dynamic temperature adjustment based on layer importance for previously learned knowledge.This allows for a controlled adaptation to new tasks that respects the stability-plasticity balance critical in continual learning.Through extensive experiments across three datasets, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing regularization-based continual learning strategies.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>IWD shows an average improvement of 3.60\% over the state-of-the-art LwF method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.662</span></span>The results highlight the potential of our method to serve as a robust framework for real-world applications where models must evolve with new data without forgetting past knowledge.</p>

                  <p>Crack segmentation is crucial in civil engineering, particularly for assessing pavement integrity and ensuring the durability of infrastructure.While deep learning has advanced RGB-based segmentation, performance degrades under adverse conditions like low illumination or motion blur.Thermal imaging offers complementary information by capturing emitted radiation, improving crack detection in challenging environments.Combining RGB and thermal images (RGB-T) for crack segmentation shows promise in complex real-world conditions, such as adverse weather, yet research in this area remains limited.Current RGB-T segmentation methods often fail to fully exploit the complementary relationships between modalities at various levels of interaction.To address this, we propose IRFusionFormer, a novel model for crack segmentation that effectively integrates RGB and thermal data.Our Efficient RGB-T Cross Fusion Module captures multi-scale relationships and long-range dependencies between modalities without significant computational overhead.Additionally, we introduce the Interaction-Hybrid-Branch-Supervision framework, which enhances interaction between modalities by distributing fused features across branches with joint supervision.To maintain the topological structure of cracks, we introduce a novel topology-based loss function that preserves connectivity during training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a Dice score of 90.01% and an IoU of 81.83%, significantly improving robustness and accuracy in varying environmental conditions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span>These advancements address key challenges in pavement crack segmentation, offering a more reliable and efficient solution.For access to the codes, data, and models from this study, visit https://github.com/sheauhuu/IRFusionFormer</p>

                  <p>Self-supervised pretraining (SSP) has shown promising results in learning from large unlabeled datasets and, thus, could be useful for automated cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) short-axis cine segmentation.However, inconsistent reports of the benefits of SSP for segmentation have made it difficult to apply SSP to CMR.Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate SSP methods for CMR cine segmentation.   To this end, short-axis cine stacks of 296 subjects (90618 2D slices) were used for unlabeled pretraining with four SSP methods; SimCLR, positional contrastive learning, DINO, and masked image modeling (MIM).Subsets of varying numbers of subjects were used for supervised fine-tuning of 2D models for each SSP method, as well as to train a 2D baseline model from scratch.The fine-tuned models were compared to the baseline using the 3D Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) in a test dataset of 140 subjects.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The SSP methods showed no performance gains with the largest supervised fine-tuning subset compared to the baseline (DSC = 0.89). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span>When only 10 subjects (231 2D slices) are available for supervised training, SSP using MIM (DSC = 0.86) improves over training from scratch (DSC = 0.82).   This study found that SSP is valuable for CMR cine segmentation when labeled training data is scarce, but does not aid state-of-the-art deep learning methods when ample labeled data is available.Moreover, the choice of SSP method is important.The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/q-cardIA/ssp-cmr-cine-segmentation</p>

                  <p>Prototyping complex computer-aided design (CAD) models in modern softwares can be very time-consuming.This is due to the lack of intelligent systems that can quickly generate simpler intermediate parts.We propose Text2CAD, the first AI framework for generating text-to-parametric CAD models using designer-friendly instructions for all skill levels.Furthermore, we introduce a data annotation pipeline for generating text prompts based on natural language instructions for the DeepCAD dataset using Mistral and LLaVA-NeXT.The dataset contains $\sim170$K models and $\sim660$K text annotations, from abstract CAD descriptions (e.g., generate two concentric cylinders) to detailed specifications (e.g., draw two circles with center $(x,y)$ and radius $r_{1}$, $r_{2}$, and extrude along the normal by $d$...).Within the Text2CAD framework, we propose an end-to-end transformer-based auto-regressive network to generate parametric CAD models from input texts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate the performance of our model through a mixture of metrics, including visual quality, parametric precision, and geometrical accuracy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.63</span></span>Our proposed framework shows great potential in AI-aided design applications.Our source code and annotations will be publicly available.</p>

Methodology:We conducted an exploratory interview study of RIA in three large enterprises.We focused on how they conduct RIA, emphasizing cross-functional interactions, and using the EAA as an example.   Results: RIA, as a regulatory RE process, is conducted to address the needs of executive management and central functions.It involves coordination between different functions and levels of enterprise hierarchy.Enterprises use artifacts to support interpretation and communication of the results of RIA.Challenges to RIA are mainly related to the execution of such coordination and managing the knowledge involved.   Conclusion: RIA in large enterprises demands close coordination of multiple stakeholders and roles.Applying interpretation and compliance artifacts is one approach to support such coordination.However, there are no established practices for creating and managing such artifacts.</p>
