                  <p>Sign Language Recognition has been studied and developed throughout the years to help the deaf and hard-of-hearing people in their day-to-day lives.These technologies leverage manual sign recognition algorithms, however, most of them lack the recognition of facial expressions, which are also an essential part of Sign Language as they allow the speaker to add expressiveness to their dialogue or even change the meaning of certain manual signs.SLVideo is a video moment retrieval software for Sign Language videos with a focus on both hands and facial signs.The system extracts embedding representations for the hand and face signs from video frames to capture the language signs in full.This will then allow the user to search for a specific sign language video segment with text queries, or to search by similar sign language videos.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To test this system, a collection of five hours of annotated Sign Language videos is used as the dataset, and the initial results are promising in a zero-shot setting. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.799</span></span>SLVideo is shown to not only address the problem of searching sign language videos but also supports a Sign Language thesaurus with a search by similarity technique.

                  <p>The spike camera, with its high temporal resolution, low latency, and high dynamic range, addresses high-speed imaging challenges like motion blur.It captures photons at each pixel independently, creating binary spike streams rich in temporal information but challenging for image reconstruction.Current algorithms, both traditional and deep learning-based, still need to be improved in the utilization of the rich temporal detail and the restoration of the details of the reconstructed image.To overcome this, we introduce Swin Spikeformer (SwinSF), a novel model for dynamic scene reconstruction from spike streams.SwinSF is composed of Spike Feature Extraction, Spatial-Temporal Feature Extraction, and Final Reconstruction Module.It combines shifted window self-attention and proposed temporal spike attention, ensuring a comprehensive feature extraction that encapsulates both spatial and temporal dynamics, leading to a more robust and accurate reconstruction of spike streams.Furthermore, we build a new synthesized dataset for spike image reconstruction which matches the resolution of the latest spike camera, ensuring its relevance and applicability to the latest developments in spike camera imaging.Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed network SwinSF sets a new benchmark, achieving state-of-the-art performance across a series of datasets, including both real-world and synthesized data across various resolutions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our codes and proposed dataset will be available soon. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.883</span></span></p>

                  <p>Text conditioned generative models for images have yielded impressive results.Text conditioned floorplan generation as a special type of raster image generation task also received particular attention.However there are many use cases in floorpla generation where numerical properties of the generated result are more important than the aesthetics.For instance, one might want to specify sizes for certain rooms in a floorplan and compare the generated floorplan with given specifications Current approaches, datasets and commonly used evaluations do not support these kinds of constraints.As such, an attractive strategy is to generate an intermediate data structure that contains numerical properties of a floorplan which can be used to generate the final floorplan image.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To explore this setting we (1) construct a new dataset for this data-structure to data-structure formulation of floorplan generation using two popular image based floorplan datasets RPLAN and ProcTHOR-10k, and provide the tools to convert further procedurally generated ProcTHOR floorplan data into our format. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.973</span></span>(2) We explore the task of floorplan generation given a partial or complete set of constraints and we design a series of metrics and benchmarks to enable evaluating how well samples generated from models respect the constraints.(3) We create multiple baselines by finetuning a large language model (LLM), Llama3, and demonstrate the feasibility of using floorplan data structure conditioned LLMs for the problem of floorplan generation respecting numerical constraints.We hope that our new datasets and benchmarks will encourage further research on different ways to improve the performance of LLMs and other generative modelling techniques for generating designs where quantitative constraints are only partially specified, but must be respected.</p>

                  <p>Weakly supervised video object segmentation (WSVOS) enables the identification of segmentation maps without requiring an extensive training dataset of object masks, relying instead on coarse video labels indicating object presence.Current state-of-the-art methods either require multiple independent stages of processing that employ motion cues or, in the case of end-to-end trainable networks, lack in segmentation accuracy, in part due to the difficulty of learning segmentation maps from videos with transient object presence.This limits the application of WSVOS for semantic annotation of surgical videos where multiple surgical tools frequently move in and out of the field of view, a problem that is more difficult than typically encountered in WSVOS.This paper introduces Video Spatio-Temporal Disentanglement Networks (VDST-Net), a framework to disentangle spatiotemporal information using semi-decoupled knowledge distillation to predict high-quality class activation maps (CAMs).A teacher network designed to resolve temporal conflicts when specifics about object location and timing in the video are not provided works with a student network that integrates information over time by leveraging temporal dependencies.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework on a public reference dataset and on a more challenging surgical video dataset where objects are, on average, present in less than 60\% of annotated frames. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.756</span></span>Our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques and generates superior segmentation masks under video-level weak supervision.</p>

                  <p>Facial Recognition Systems (FRSs) are being developed and deployed globally at unprecedented rates.Most platforms are designed in a limited set of countries but deployed in worldwide, without adequate checkpoints.This is especially problematic for Global South countries which lack strong legislation to safeguard persons facing disparate performance of these systems.A combination of unavailability of datasets, lack of understanding of FRS functionality and low-resource bias mitigation measures accentuate the problem.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we propose a new face dataset composed of 6,579 unique male and female sportspersons from eight countries around the world. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.894</span></span>More than 50% of the dataset comprises individuals from the Global South countries and is demographically diverse.To aid adversarial audits and robust model training, each image has four adversarial variants, totaling over 40,000 images.We also benchmark five popular FRSs, both commercial and open-source, for the task of gender prediction (and country prediction for one of the open-source models as an example of red-teaming).Experiments on industrial FRSs reveal accuracies ranging from 98.2%--38.1%, with a large disparity between males and females in the Global South (max difference of 38.5%).Biases are also observed in all FRSs between females of the Global North and South (max difference of ~50%).Grad-CAM analysis identifies the nose, forehead and mouth as the regions of interest on one of the open-source FRSs.Utilizing this insight, we design simple, low-resource bias mitigation solutions using few-shot and novel contrastive learning techniques significantly improving the accuracy with disparity between males and females reducing from 50% to 1.5% in one of the settings.In the red-teaming experiment with the open-source Deepface model, contrastive learning proves more effective than simple fine-tuning.</p>

                  <p>The task of labeling multiple organs for segmentation is a complex and time-consuming process, resulting in a scarcity of comprehensively labeled multi-organ datasets while the emergence of numerous partially labeled datasets.Current methods are inadequate in effectively utilizing the supervised information available from these datasets, thereby impeding the progress in improving the segmentation accuracy.This paper proposes a two-stage multi-organ segmentation method based on mutual learning, aiming to improve multi-organ segmentation performance by complementing information among partially labeled datasets.In the first stage, each partial-organ segmentation model utilizes the non-overlapping organ labels from different datasets and the distinct organ features extracted by different models, introducing additional mutual difference learning to generate higher quality pseudo labels for unlabeled organs.In the second stage, each full-organ segmentation model is supervised by fully labeled datasets with pseudo labels and leverages true labels from other datasets, while dynamically sharing accurate features across different models, introducing additional mutual similarity learning to enhance multi-organ segmentation performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments were conducted on nine datasets that included the head and neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.7</span></span>The results indicate that our method has achieved SOTA performance in segmentation tasks that rely on partial labels, and the ablation studies have thoroughly confirmed the efficacy of the mutual learning mechanism.</p>

                  <p>3D surface reconstruction from images is essential for numerous applications.Recently, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have emerged as a promising framework for 3D modeling.However, NeRFs require accurate camera poses as input, and existing methods struggle to handle significantly noisy pose estimates (i.e., outliers), which are commonly encountered in real-world scenarios.To tackle this challenge, we present a novel approach that optimizes radiance fields with scene graphs to mitigate the influence of outlier poses.Our method incorporates an adaptive inlier-outlier confidence estimation scheme based on scene graphs, emphasizing images of high compatibility with the neighborhood and consistency in the rendering quality.We also introduce an effective intersection-over-union (IoU) loss to optimize the camera pose and surface geometry, together with a coarse-to-fine strategy to facilitate the training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we propose a new dataset containing typical outlier poses for a detailed evaluation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.75</span></span>Experimental results on various datasets consistently demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method over existing approaches, showcasing its robustness in handling outliers and producing high-quality 3D reconstructions.Our code and data are available at: \url{https://github.com/Iris-cyy/SG-NeRF}.</p>

                  <p>High-quality 3D photoacoustic imaging (PAI) reconstruction under sparse view or limited view has long been challenging.Traditional 3D iterative-based reconstruction methods suffer from both slow speed and high memory consumption.Recently, in computer graphics, the differentiable rendering has made significant progress, particularly with the rise of 3D Gaussian Splatting.Inspired by these, we introduce differentiable radiation into PAI, developing a novel reconstruction algorithm: the Sliding Ball Adaptive Growth algorithm (SlingBAG) for 3D PAI, which shows ability in high-quality 3D PAI reconstruction both under extremely sparse view and limited view.   We established the point cloud dataset in PAI, and used unique differentiable rapid radiator based on the spherical decomposition strategy and the randomly initialized point cloud adaptively optimized according to sparse sensor data.Each point undergoes updates in 3D coordinates, initial pressure, and resolution (denoted by the radius of ball).Points undergo adaptive growth during iterative process, including point destroying, splitting and duplicating along the gradient of their positions, manifesting the sliding ball effect.   Finally, our point cloud to voxel grid shader renders the final reconstruction results.Simulation and in vivo experiments demonstrate that our SlingBAG reconstruction result's SNR can be more than 40 dB under extremely sparse view, while the SNR of traditional back-projection algorithm's result is less than 20 dB. Moreover, the result of SlingBAG's structural similarity to the ground truth is significantly higher, with an SSIM value of 95.6%.   Notably, our differentiable rapid radiator can conduct forward PA simulation in homogeneous, non-viscous media substantially faster than current methods that numerically simulate the wave propagation, such as k-Wave.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset and all code will be open source. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.901</span></span></p>

                  <p>Objects, in particular tools, provide several action possibilities to the agents that can act on them, which are generally associated with the term of affordances.A tool is typically designed for a specific purpose, such as driving a nail in the case of a hammer, which we call as the primary affordance.A tool can also be used beyond its primary purpose, in which case we can associate this auxiliary use with the term secondary affordance.Previous work on affordance perception and learning has been mostly focused on primary affordances.Here, we address the less explored problem of learning the secondary tool affordances of human partners.To do this, we use the iCub robot to observe human partners with three cameras while they perform actions on twenty objects using four different tools.In our experiments, human partners utilize tools to perform actions that do not correspond to their primary affordances.For example, the iCub robot observes a human partner using a ruler for pushing, pulling, and moving objects instead of measuring their lengths.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this setting, we constructed a dataset by taking images of objects before and after each action is executed. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.799</span></span>We then model learning secondary affordances by training three neural networks (ResNet-18, ResNet-50, and ResNet-101) each on three tasks, using raw images showing the `initial' and `final' position of objects as input: (1) predicting the tool used to move an object, (2) predicting the tool used with an additional categorical input that encoded the action performed, and (3) joint prediction of both tool used and action performed.Our results indicate that deep learning architectures enable the iCub robot to predict secondary tool affordances, thereby paving the road for human-robot collaborative object manipulation involving complex affordances.</p>

                  <p>Long-term action anticipation has become an important task for many applications such as autonomous driving and human-robot interaction.Unlike short-term anticipation, predicting more actions into the future imposes a real challenge with the increasing uncertainty in longer horizons.While there has been a significant progress in predicting more actions into the future, most of the proposed methods address the task in a deterministic setup and ignore the underlying uncertainty.In this paper, we propose a novel Gated Temporal Diffusion (GTD) network that models the uncertainty of both the observation and the future predictions.As generator, we introduce a Gated Anticipation Network (GTAN) to model both observed and unobserved frames of a video in a mutual representation.On the one hand, using a mutual representation for past and future allows us to jointly model ambiguities in the observation and future, while on the other hand GTAN can by design treat the observed and unobserved parts differently and steer the information flow between them.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our model achieves state-of-the-art results on the Breakfast, Assembly101 and 50Salads datasets in both stochastic and deterministic settings. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.797</span></span>Code: https://github.com/olga-zats/GTDA .</p>

                  <p>We present the Code Documentation and Analysis Tool (CoDAT).CoDAT is a tool designed to maintain consistency between the various levels of code documentation, e.g. if a line in a code sketch is changed, the comment that documents the corresponding code is also changed.That is, comments are linked and updated so as to remain internally consistent and also consistent with the code.By flagging "out of date" comments, CoDAT alerts the developer to maintain up-to-date documentation.   We use a large language model to check the semantic consistency between a fragment of code and the comments that describe it.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Thus we also flag semantic inconsistency as well as out of date comments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.609</span></span>This helps programers write code that correctly implements a code sketch, and so provides machine support for a step-wise refinement approach, starting with a code sketch and proceeding down to code through one or more refinement iterations.   CoDAT is implemented in the Intellij IDEA IDE where we use the Code Insight daemon package alongside a custom regular expression algorithm to mark tagged comments whose corresponding code blocks have changed.CoDAT's backend is structurally decentralized to allow a distributed ledger framework for code consistency and architectural compilation tracking.</p>

                  <p>Deep neural networks are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, a type of adversarial attack that poisons the training data to manipulate the behavior of models trained on such data.Clean-label attacks are a more stealthy form of backdoor attacks that can perform the attack without changing the labels of poisoned data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Early works on clean-label attacks added triggers to a random subset of the training set, ignoring the fact that samples contribute unequally to the attack's success. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.633</span></span>This results in high poisoning rates and low attack success rates.To alleviate the problem, several supervised learning-based sample selection strategies have been proposed.However, these methods assume access to the entire labeled training set and require training, which is expensive and may not always be practical.This work studies a new and more practical (but also more challenging) threat model where the attacker only provides data for the target class (e.g., in face recognition systems) and has no knowledge of the victim model or any other classes in the training set.We study different strategies for selectively poisoning a small set of training samples in the target class to boost the attack success rate in this setting.Our threat model poses a serious threat in training machine learning models with third-party datasets, since the attack can be performed effectively with limited information.Experiments on benchmark datasets illustrate the effectiveness of our strategies in improving clean-label backdoor attacks.</p>

                  <p>Semi-Supervised Visual Grounding (SSVG) is a new challenge for its sparse labeled data with the need for multimodel understanding.A previous study, RefTeacher, makes the first attempt to tackle this task by adopting the teacher-student framework to provide pseudo confidence supervision and attention-based supervision.However, this approach is incompatible with current state-of-the-art visual grounding models, which follow the Transformer-based pipeline.These pipelines directly regress results without region proposals or foreground binary classification, rendering them unsuitable for fitting in RefTeacher due to the absence of confidence scores.Furthermore, the geometric difference in teacher and student inputs, stemming from different data augmentations, induces natural misalignment in attention-based constraints.To establish a compatible SSVG framework, our paper proposes the ACTive REtraining approach for Semi-Supervised Visual Grounding, abbreviated as ACTRESS.Initially, the model is enhanced by incorporating an additional quantized detection head to expose its detection confidence.Building upon this, ACTRESS consists of an active sampling strategy and a selective retraining strategy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The active sampling strategy iteratively selects high-quality pseudo labels by evaluating three crucial aspects: Faithfulness, Robustness, and Confidence, optimizing the utilization of unlabeled data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span>The selective retraining strategy retrains the model with periodic re-initialization of specific parameters, facilitating the model's escape from local minima.Extensive experiments demonstrates our superior performance on widely-used benchmark datasets.</p>

                  <p>Existing open-set recognition (OSR) studies typically assume that each image contains only one class label, and the unknown test set (negative) has a disjoint label space from the known test set (positive), a scenario termed full-label shift.This paper introduces the mixed OSR problem, where test images contain multiple class semantics, with known and unknown classes co-occurring in negatives, leading to a more challenging super-label shift.Addressing the mixed OSR requires classification models to accurately distinguish different class semantics within images and measure their "knowness".In this study, we propose the OpenSlot framework, built upon object-centric learning.OpenSlot utilizes slot features to represent diverse class semantics and produce class predictions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through our proposed anti-noise-slot (ANS) technique, we mitigate the impact of noise (invalid and background) slots during classification training, effectively addressing the semantic misalignment between class predictions and the ground truth. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.641</span></span>We conduct extensive experiments with OpenSlot on mixed & conventional OSR benchmarks.Without elaborate designs, OpenSlot not only exceeds existing OSR studies in detecting super-label shifts across single & multi-label mixed OSR tasks but also achieves state-of-the-art performance on conventional benchmarks.Remarkably, our method can localize class objects without using bounding boxes during training.The competitive performance in open-set object detection demonstrates OpenSlot's ability to explicitly explain label shifts and benefits in computational efficiency and generalization.</p>

                  <p>Molecular testing of tumor samples for targetable biomarkers is restricted by a lack of standardization, turnaround-time, cost, and tissue availability across cancer types.Additionally, targetable alterations of low prevalence may not be tested in routine workflows.Algorithms that predict DNA alterations from routinely generated hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained images could prioritize samples for confirmatory molecular testing.Costs and the necessity of a large number of samples containing mutations limit approaches that train individual algorithms for each alteration.In this work, models were trained for simultaneous prediction of multiple DNA alterations from H&E images using a multi-task approach.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Compared to biomarker-specific models, this approach performed better on average, with pronounced gains for rare mutations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.69</span></span>The models reasonably generalized to independent temporal-holdout, externally-stained, and multi-site TCGA test sets.Additionally, whole slide image embeddings derived using multi-task models demonstrated strong performance in downstream tasks that were not a part of training.Overall, this is a promising approach to develop clinically useful algorithms that provide multiple actionable predictions from a single slide.</p>

                  <p>Predicting camera-space hand meshes from single RGB images is crucial for enabling realistic hand interactions in 3D virtual and augmented worlds.Previous work typically divided the task into two stages: given a cropped image of the hand, predict meshes in relative coordinates, followed by lifting these predictions into camera space in a separate and independent stage, often resulting in the loss of valuable contextual and scale information.To prevent the loss of these cues, we propose unifying these two stages into an end-to-end solution that addresses the 2D-3D correspondence problem.This solution enables back-propagation from camera space outputs to the rest of the network through a new differentiable global positioning module.We also introduce an image rectification step that harmonizes both the training dataset and the input image as if they were acquired with the same camera, helping to alleviate the inherent scale-depth ambiguity of the problem.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We validate the effectiveness of our framework in evaluations against several baselines and state-of-the-art approaches across three public benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.75</span></span></p>

                  <p>Person Re-identification (re-ID) in computer vision aims to recognize and track individuals across different cameras.While previous research has mainly focused on challenges like pose variations and lighting changes, the impact of extreme capture conditions is often not adequately addressed.These extreme conditions, including varied lighting, camera styles, angles, and image distortions, can significantly affect data distribution and re-ID accuracy.   Current research typically improves model generalization under normal shooting conditions through data augmentation techniques such as adjusting brightness and contrast.However, these methods pay less attention to the robustness of models under extreme shooting conditions.To tackle this, we propose a multi-mode synchronization learning (MMSL) strategy .This approach involves dividing images into grids, randomly selecting grid blocks, and applying data augmentation methods like contrast and brightness adjustments.This process introduces diverse transformations without altering the original image structure, helping the model adapt to extreme variations.This method improves the model's generalization under extreme conditions and enables learning diverse features, thus better addressing the challenges in re-ID.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on a simulated test set under extreme conditions have demonstrated the effectiveness of our method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.647</span></span>This approach is crucial for enhancing model robustness and adaptability in real-world scenarios, supporting the future development of person re-identification technology.</p>

                  <p>Deep convolutional neural networks have made significant breakthroughs in medical image classification, under the assumption that training samples from all classes are simultaneously available.However, in real-world medical scenarios, there's a common need to continuously learn about new diseases, leading to the emerging field of class incremental learning (CIL) in the medical domain.Typically, CIL suffers from catastrophic forgetting when trained on new classes.This phenomenon is mainly caused by the imbalance between old and new classes, and it becomes even more challenging with imbalanced medical datasets.In this work, we introduce two simple yet effective plug-in methods to mitigate the adverse effects of the imbalance.First, we propose a CIL-balanced classification loss to mitigate the classifier bias toward majority classes via logit adjustment.Second, we propose a distribution margin loss that not only alleviates the inter-class overlap in embedding space but also enforces the intra-class compactness.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate the effectiveness of our method with extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets (CCH5000, HAM10000, and EyePACS). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.733</span></span></p>

                  <p>Object detection is a core task in computer vision.Over the years, the development of numerous models has significantly enhanced performance.However, these conventional models are usually limited by the data on which they were trained and by the category logic they define.With the recent rise of Language-Visual Models, new methods have emerged that are not restricted to these fixed categories.Despite their flexibility, such Open Vocabulary detection models still fall short in accuracy compared to traditional models with fixed classes.At the same time, more accurate data-specific models face challenges when there is a need to extend classes or merge different datasets for training.The latter often cannot be combined due to different logics or conflicting class definitions, making it difficult to improve a model without compromising its performance.In this paper, we introduce CerberusDet, a framework with a multi-headed model designed for handling multiple object detection tasks.Proposed model is built on the YOLO architecture and efficiently shares visual features from both backbone and neck components, while maintaining separate task heads.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This approach allows CerberusDet to perform very efficiently while still delivering optimal results. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.609</span></span>We evaluated the model on the PASCAL VOC dataset and additional categories from the Objects365 dataset to demonstrate its abilities.CerberusDet achieved results comparable to state-of-the-art data-specific models with 36% less inference time.The more tasks are trained together, the more efficient the proposed model becomes compared to running individual models sequentially.The training and inference code, as well as the model, are available as open-source (https://github.com/ai-forever/CerberusDet).</p>

                  <p>Most current LLM-based models for video understanding can process videos within minutes.However, they struggle with lengthy videos due to challenges such as "noise and redundancy", as well as "memory and computation" constraints.In this paper, we present Goldfish, a methodology tailored for comprehending videos of arbitrary lengths.We also introduce the TVQA-long benchmark, specifically designed to evaluate models' capabilities in understanding long videos with questions in both vision and text content.Goldfish approaches these challenges with an efficient retrieval mechanism that initially gathers the top-k video clips relevant to the instruction before proceeding to provide the desired response.This design of the retrieval mechanism enables the Goldfish to efficiently process arbitrarily long video sequences, facilitating its application in contexts such as movies or television series.To facilitate the retrieval process, we developed MiniGPT4-Video that generates detailed descriptions for the video clips.In addressing the scarcity of benchmarks for long video evaluation, we adapted the TVQA short video benchmark for extended content analysis by aggregating questions from entire episodes, thereby shifting the evaluation from partial to full episode comprehension.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We attained a 41.78% accuracy rate on the TVQA-long benchmark, surpassing previous methods by 14.94%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.695</span></span>Our MiniGPT4-Video also shows exceptional performance in short video comprehension, exceeding existing state-of-the-art methods by 3.23%, 2.03%, 16.5% and 23.59% on the MSVD, MSRVTT, TGIF, and TVQA short video benchmarks, respectively.These results indicate that our models have significant improvements in both long and short-video understanding.Our models and code have been made publicly available at https://vision-cair.github.io/Goldfish_website/</p>

                  <p>Due to the fascinating generative performance of text-to-image diffusion models, growing text-to-3D generation works explore distilling the 2D generative priors into 3D, using the score distillation sampling (SDS) loss, to bypass the data scarcity problem.The existing text-to-3D methods have achieved promising results in realism and 3D consistency, but text-to-4D generation still faces challenges, including lack of realism and insufficient dynamic motions.In this paper, we propose a novel method for text-to-4D generation, which ensures the dynamic amplitude and authenticity through direct supervision provided by a video prior.Specifically, we adopt a text-to-video diffusion model to generate a reference video and divide 4D generation into two stages: static generation and dynamic generation.The static 3D generation is achieved under the guidance of the input text and the first frame of the reference video, while in the dynamic generation stage, we introduce a customized SDS loss to ensure multi-view consistency, a video-based SDS loss to improve temporal consistency, and most importantly, direct priors from the reference video to ensure the quality of geometry and texture.Moreover, we design a prior-switching training strategy to avoid conflicts between different priors and fully leverage the benefits of each prior.In addition, to enrich the generated motion, we further introduce a dynamic modeling representation composed of a deformation network and a topology network, which ensures dynamic continuity while modeling topological changes.Our method not only supports text-to-4D generation but also enables 4D generation from monocular videos.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The comparison experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to existing methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.796</span></span></p>

                  <p>Vision Transformers (ViT) have emerged as the de-facto choice for numerous industry grade vision solutions.But their inference cost can be prohibitive for many settings, as they compute self-attention in each layer which suffers from quadratic computational complexity in the number of tokens.On the other hand, spatial information in images and spatio-temporal information in videos is usually sparse and redundant.In this work, we introduce LookupViT, that aims to exploit this information sparsity to reduce ViT inference cost.LookupViT provides a novel general purpose vision transformer block that operates by compressing information from higher resolution tokens to a fixed number of tokens.These few compressed tokens undergo meticulous processing, while the higher-resolution tokens are passed through computationally cheaper layers.Information sharing between these two token sets is enabled through a bidirectional cross-attention mechanism.The approach offers multiple advantages - (a) easy to implement on standard ML accelerators (GPUs/TPUs) via standard high-level operators, (b) applicable to standard ViT and its variants, thus generalizes to various tasks, (c) can handle different tokenization and attention approaches.LookupViT also offers flexibility for the compressed tokens, enabling performance-computation trade-offs in a single trained model.We show LookupViT's effectiveness on multiple domains - (a) for image-classification (ImageNet-1K and ImageNet-21K), (b) video classification (Kinetics400 and Something-Something V2), (c) image captioning (COCO-Captions) with a frozen encoder.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>LookupViT provides $2\times$ reduction in FLOPs while upholding or improving accuracy across these domains. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span>In addition, LookupViT also demonstrates out-of-the-box robustness and generalization on image classification (ImageNet-C,R,A,O), improving by up to $4\%$ over ViT.</p>

                  <p>Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) aims to achieve pixel-level localization of sound sources in videos, while Audio-Visual Semantic Segmentation (AVSS), as an extension of AVS, further pursues semantic understanding of audio-visual scenes.However, since the AVSS task requires the establishment of audio-visual correspondence and semantic understanding simultaneously, we observe that previous methods have struggled to handle this mashup of objectives in end-to-end training, resulting in insufficient learning and sub-optimization.Therefore, we propose a two-stage training strategy called \textit{Stepping Stones}, which decomposes the AVSS task into two simple subtasks from localization to semantic understanding, which are fully optimized in each stage to achieve step-by-step global optimization.This training strategy has also proved its generalization and effectiveness on existing methods.To further improve the performance of AVS tasks, we propose a novel framework Adaptive Audio Visual Segmentation, in which we incorporate an adaptive audio query generator and integrate masked attention into the transformer decoder, facilitating the adaptive fusion of visual and audio features.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments demonstrate that our methods achieve state-of-the-art results on all three AVS benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.708</span></span>The project homepage can be accessed at https://gewu-lab.github.io/stepping_stones/.</p>

                  <p>While the use of machine learning for the detection of propaganda techniques in text has garnered considerable attention, most approaches focus on "black-box" solutions with opaque inner workings.Interpretable approaches provide a solution, however, they depend on careful feature engineering and costly expert annotated data.Additionally, language features specific to propagandistic text are generally the focus of rhetoricians or linguists, and there is no data set labeled with such features suitable for machine learning.This study codifies 22 rhetorical and linguistic features identified in literature related to the language of persuasion for the purpose of annotating an existing data set labeled with propaganda techniques.To help human experts annotate natural language sentences with these features, RhetAnn, a web application, was specifically designed to minimize an otherwise considerable mental effort.Finally, a small set of annotated data was used to fine-tune GPT-3.5, a generative large language model (LLM), to annotate the remaining data while optimizing for financial cost and classification accuracy.This study demonstrates how combining a small number of human annotated examples with GPT can be an effective strategy for scaling the annotation process at a fraction of the cost of traditional annotation relying solely on human experts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results are on par with the best performing model at the time of writing, namely GPT-4, at 10x less the cost. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.608</span></span>Our contribution is a set of features, their properties, definitions, and examples in a machine-readable format, along with the code for RhetAnn and the GPT prompts and fine-tuning procedures for advancing state-of-the-art interpretable propaganda technique detection.</p>

                  <p>Class-Incremental Semantic Segmentation(CISS) aims to learn new classes without forgetting the old ones, using only the labels of the new classes.To achieve this, two popular strategies are employed: 1) pseudo-labeling and knowledge distillation to preserve prior knowledge; and 2) background weight transfer, which leverages the broad coverage of background in learning new classes by transferring background weight to the new class classifier.However, the first strategy heavily relies on the old model in detecting old classes while undetected pixels are regarded as the background, thereby leading to the background shift towards the old classes(i.e., misclassification of old class as background).Additionally, in the case of the second approach, initializing the new class classifier with background knowledge triggers a similar background shift issue, but towards the new classes.To address these issues, we propose a background-class separation framework for CISS.To begin with, selective pseudo-labeling and adaptive feature distillation are to distill only trustworthy past knowledge.On the other hand, we encourage the separation between the background and new classes with a novel orthogonal objective along with label-guided output distillation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our state-of-the-art results validate the effectiveness of these proposed methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.748</span></span></p>

                  <p>Transformers have achieved the state-of-the-art performance on solving the inverse problem of Snapshot Compressive Imaging (SCI) for video, whose ill-posedness is rooted in the mixed degradation of spatial masking and temporal aliasing.However, previous Transformers lack an insight into the degradation and thus have limited performance and efficiency.In this work, we tailor an efficient reconstruction architecture without temporal aggregation in early layers and Hierarchical Separable Video Transformer (HiSViT) as building block.HiSViT is built by multiple groups of Cross-Scale Separable Multi-head Self-Attention (CSS-MSA) and Gated Self-Modulated Feed-Forward Network (GSM-FFN) with dense connections, each of which is conducted within a separate channel portions at a different scale, for multi-scale interactions and long-range modeling.By separating spatial operations from temporal ones, CSS-MSA introduces an inductive bias of paying more attention within frames instead of between frames while saving computational overheads.GSM-FFN is design to enhance the locality via gated mechanism and factorized spatial-temporal convolutions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms previous methods by $>\!0.5$ dB with comparable or fewer complexity and parameters. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.704</span></span>The source codes and pretrained models are released at https://github.com/pwangcs/HiSViT.</p>

                  <p>Text conditioned generative models for images have yielded impressive results.Text conditioned floorplan generation as a special type of raster image generation task also received particular attention.However there are many use cases in floorpla generation where numerical properties of the generated result are more important than the aesthetics.For instance, one might want to specify sizes for certain rooms in a floorplan and compare the generated floorplan with given specifications Current approaches, datasets and commonly used evaluations do not support these kinds of constraints.As such, an attractive strategy is to generate an intermediate data structure that contains numerical properties of a floorplan which can be used to generate the final floorplan image.To explore this setting we (1) construct a new dataset for this data-structure to data-structure formulation of floorplan generation using two popular image based floorplan datasets RPLAN and ProcTHOR-10k, and provide the tools to convert further procedurally generated ProcTHOR floorplan data into our format.(2) We explore the task of floorplan generation given a partial or complete set of constraints and we design a series of metrics and benchmarks to enable evaluating how well samples generated from models respect the constraints.(3) We create multiple baselines by finetuning a large language model (LLM), Llama3, and demonstrate the feasibility of using floorplan data structure conditioned LLMs for the problem of floorplan generation respecting numerical constraints.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We hope that our new datasets and benchmarks will encourage further research on different ways to improve the performance of LLMs and other generative modelling techniques for generating designs where quantitative constraints are only partially specified, but must be respected. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span></p>

                  <p>[Context] The adoption of micro-frontends architectures has gained traction as a promising approach to enhance modularity, scalability, and maintainability of web applications.[Goal] The primary aim of this research is to investigate the benefits and limitations of migrating a real-world application to a micro-frontends architecture from the perspective of the developers.[Method] Based on the action research approach, after diagnosis and planning, we applied an intervention of migrating the target web application to a micro-frontends architecture.Thereafter, the migration was evaluated in a workshop involving the remaining developers responsible for maintaining the application.During the workshop, these developers were presented with the migrated architecture, conducted a simple maintenance task, discussed benefits and limitations in a focus group to gather insights, and answered a questionnaire on the acceptance of the technology.[Results] Developers' perceptions gathered during the focus group reinforce the benefits and limitations reported in the literature.Key benefits included enhanced flexibility in technology choices, scalability of development teams, and gradual migration of technologies.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, the increased complexity of the architecture raised concerns among developers, particularly in dependency and environment management, debugging, and integration testing. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span>[Conclusions] While micro-frontends represent a promising technology, unresolved issues still limit their broader applicability.Developers generally perceived the architecture as useful and moderately easy to use but hesitated to adopt it.</p>
