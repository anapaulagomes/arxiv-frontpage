                  <p>Precise vehicle state estimation is crucial for safe and reliable autonomous driving.The number of measurable states and their precision offered by the onboard vehicle sensor system are often constrained by cost.For instance, measuring critical quantities such as the Vehicle Sideslip Angle (VSA) poses significant commercial challenges using current optical sensors.This paper addresses these limitations by focusing on the development of high-performance virtual sensors to enhance vehicle state estimation for active safety.The proposed Uncertainty-Aware Hybrid Learning (UAHL) architecture integrates a machine learning model with vehicle motion models to estimate VSA directly from onboard sensor data.A key aspect of the UAHL architecture is its focus on uncertainty quantification for individual model estimates and hybrid fusion.These mechanisms enable the dynamic weighting of uncertainty-aware predictions from machine learning and vehicle motion models to produce accurate and reliable hybrid VSA estimates.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This work also presents a novel dataset named Real-world Vehicle State Estimation Dataset (ReV-StED), comprising synchronized measurements from advanced vehicle dynamic sensors. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.735</span></span>The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method for VSA estimation, highlighting UAHL as a promising architecture for advancing virtual sensors and enhancing active safety in autonomous vehicles.</p>

                  <p>While many EDA tasks already involve graph-based data, existing LLMs in EDA primarily either represent graphs as sequential text, or simply ignore graph-structured data that might be beneficial like dataflow graphs of RTL code.Recent studies have found that LLM performance suffers when graphs are represented as sequential text, and using additional graph information significantly boosts performance.To address these challenges, we introduce BRIDGES, a framework designed to incorporate graph modality into LLMs for EDA tasks.BRIDGES integrates an automated data generation workflow, a solution that combines graph modality with LLM, and a comprehensive evaluation suite.First, we establish an LLM-driven workflow to generate RTL and netlist-level data, converting them into dataflow and netlist graphs with function descriptions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This workflow yields a large-scale dataset comprising over 500,000 graph instances and more than 1.5 billion tokens. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.75</span></span>Second, we propose a lightweight cross-modal projector that encodes graph representations into text-compatible prompts, enabling LLMs to effectively utilize graph data without architectural modifications.Experimental results demonstrate 2x to 10x improvements across multiple tasks compared to text-only baselines, including accuracy in design retrieval, type prediction and perplexity in function description, with negligible computational overhead (<1% model weights increase and <30% additional runtime overhead).Even without additional LLM finetuning, our results outperform text-only by a large margin.We plan to release BRIDGES, including the dataset, models, and training flow.</p>

                  <p>Imitation learning has emerged as a promising approach towards building generalist robots.However, scaling imitation learning for large robot foundation models remains challenging due to its reliance on high-quality expert demonstrations.Meanwhile, large amounts of video data depicting a wide range of environments and diverse behaviors are readily available.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This data provides a rich source of information about real-world dynamics and agent-environment interactions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.789</span></span>Leveraging this data directly for imitation learning, however, has proven difficult due to the lack of action annotation required for most contemporary methods.In this work, we present Unified World Models (UWM), a framework that allows for leveraging both video and action data for policy learning.Specifically, a UWM integrates an action diffusion process and a video diffusion process within a unified transformer architecture, where independent diffusion timesteps govern each modality.We show that by simply controlling each diffusion timestep, UWM can flexibly represent a policy, a forward dynamics, an inverse dynamics, and a video generator.Through simulated and real-world experiments, we show that: (1) UWM enables effective pretraining on large-scale multitask robot datasets with both dynamics and action predictions, resulting in more generalizable and robust policies than imitation learning, (2) UWM naturally facilitates learning from action-free video data through independent control of modality-specific diffusion timesteps, further improving the performance of finetuned policies.Our results suggest that UWM offers a promising step toward harnessing large, heterogeneous datasets for scalable robot learning, and provides a simple unification between the often disparate paradigms of imitation learning and world modeling.Videos and code are available at https://weirdlabuw.github.io/uwm/.</p>

                  <p>Diffusion models are widely used for image editing tasks.Existing editing methods often design a representation manipulation procedure by curating an edit direction in the text embedding or score space.However, such a procedure faces a key challenge: overestimating the edit strength harms visual consistency while underestimating it fails the editing task.Notably, each source image may require a different editing strength, and it is costly to search for an appropriate strength via trial-and-error.To address this challenge, we propose Concept Lancet (CoLan), a zero-shot plug-and-play framework for principled representation manipulation in diffusion-based image editing.At inference time, we decompose the source input in the latent (text embedding or diffusion score) space as a sparse linear combination of the representations of the collected visual concepts.This allows us to accurately estimate the presence of concepts in each image, which informs the edit.Based on the editing task (replace/add/remove), we perform a customized concept transplant process to impose the corresponding editing direction.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To sufficiently model the concept space, we curate a conceptual representation dataset, CoLan-150K, which contains diverse descriptions and scenarios of visual terms and phrases for the latent dictionary. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.742</span></span>Experiments on multiple diffusion-based image editing baselines show that methods equipped with CoLan achieve state-of-the-art performance in editing effectiveness and consistency preservation.</p>

                  <p>Evaluating large language models (LLMs) effectively remains a critical bottleneck, as traditional static benchmarks suffer from saturation and contamination, while human evaluations are costly and slow.This hinders timely or domain-specific assessment, crucial for real-world applications.We introduce YourBench, a novel, open-source framework that addresses these limitations by enabling dynamic, automated generation of reliable, up-to-date, and domain-tailored benchmarks cheaply and without manual annotation, directly from user-provided documents.We demonstrate its efficacy by replicating 7 diverse MMLU subsets using minimal source text, achieving this for under 15 USD in total inference costs while perfectly preserving the relative model performance rankings (Spearman Rho = 1) observed on the original benchmark.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To ensure that YourBench generates data grounded in provided input instead of relying on posterior parametric knowledge in models, we also introduce Tempora-0325, a novel dataset of over 7K diverse documents, published exclusively after March 2025. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.713</span></span>Our comprehensive analysis spans 26 SoTA models from 7 major families across varying scales (3-671B parameters) to validate the quality of generated evaluations through rigorous algorithmic checks (e.g., citation grounding) and human assessments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We release the YourBench library, the Tempora-0325 dataset, 150k+ question answer pairs based on Tempora and all evaluation and inference traces to facilitate reproducible research and empower the community to generate bespoke benchmarks on demand, fostering more relevant and trustworthy LLM evaluation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.71</span></span></p>

                  <p>Nowadays, developers increasingly rely on solutions powered by Large Language Models (LLM) to assist them with their coding tasks.This makes it crucial to align these tools with human values to prevent malicious misuse.In this paper, we propose a comprehensive framework for assessing the potential harmfulness of LLMs within the software engineering domain.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We begin by developing a taxonomy of potentially harmful software engineering scenarios and subsequently, create a dataset of prompts based on this taxonomy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.762</span></span>To systematically assess the responses, we design and validate an automatic evaluator that classifies the outputs of a variety of LLMs both open-source and closed-source models, as well as general-purpose and code-specific LLMs.Furthermore, we investigate the impact of models size, architecture family, and alignment strategies on their tendency to generate harmful content.The results show significant disparities in the alignment of various LLMs for harmlessness.We find that some models and model families, such as Openhermes, are more harmful than others and that code-specific models do not perform better than their general-purpose counterparts.Notably, some fine-tuned models perform significantly worse than their base-models due to their design choices.On the other side, we find that larger models tend to be more helpful and are less likely to respond with harmful information.These results highlight the importance of targeted alignment strategies tailored to the unique challenges of software engineering tasks and provide a foundation for future work in this critical area.</p>

                  <p>Offline evaluation of recommender systems has traditionally treated the problem as a machine learning problem.In the classic case of recommending movies, where the user has provided explicit ratings of which movies they like and don't like, each user's ratings are split into test and train sets, and the evaluation task becomes to predict the held out test data using the training data.This machine learning style of evaluation makes the objective to recommend the movies that a user has watched and rated highly, which is not the same task as helping the user find movies that they would enjoy if they watched them.This mismatch in objective between evaluation and task is a compromise to avoid the cost of asking a user to evaluate recommendations by watching each movie.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>As a resource available for download, we offer an extension to the MovieLens-32M dataset that provides for new evaluation objectives. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.772</span></span>Our primary objective is to predict the movies that a user would be interested in watching, i.e. predict their watchlist.To construct this extension, we recruited MovieLens users, collected their profiles, made recommendations with a diverse set of algorithms, pooled the recommendations, and had the users assess the pools.Notably, we found that the traditional machine learning style of evaluation ranks the Popular algorithm, which recommends movies based on total number of ratings in the system, in the middle of the twenty-two recommendation runs we used to build the pools.In contrast, when we rank the runs by users' interest in watching movies, we find that recommending popular movies as a recommendation algorithm becomes one of the worst performing runs.It appears that by asking users to assess their personal recommendations, we can alleviate the popularity bias issues created by using information retrieval effectiveness measures for the evaluation of recommender systems.</p>

                  <p>Understanding tissue motion in surgery is crucial to enable applications in downstream tasks such as segmentation, 3D reconstruction, virtual tissue landmarking, autonomous probe-based scanning, and subtask autonomy.Labeled data are essential to enabling algorithms in these downstream tasks since they allow us to quantify and train algorithms.This paper introduces a point tracking challenge to address this, wherein participants can submit their algorithms for quantification.The submitted algorithms are evaluated using a dataset named surgical tattoos in infrared (STIR), with the challenge aptly named the STIR Challenge 2024.The STIR Challenge 2024 comprises two quantitative components: accuracy and efficiency.The accuracy component tests the accuracy of algorithms on in vivo and ex vivo sequences.The efficiency component tests the latency of algorithm inference.The challenge was conducted as a part of MICCAI EndoVis 2024.In this challenge, we had 8 total teams, with 4 teams submitting before and 4 submitting after challenge day.This paper details the STIR Challenge 2024, which serves to move the field towards more accurate and efficient algorithms for spatial understanding in surgery.In this paper we summarize the design, submissions, and results from the challenge.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The challenge dataset is available here: https://zenodo.org/records/14803158 , and the code for baseline models and metric calculation is available here: https://github.com/athaddius/STIRMetrics <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.749</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent studies have shown that bugs can be categorized into intrinsic and extrinsic types.Intrinsic bugs can be backtracked to specific changes in the version control system (VCS), while extrinsic bugs originate from external changes to the VCS and lack a direct bug-inducing change.Using only intrinsic bugs to train bug prediction models has been reported as beneficial to improve the performance of such models.However, there is currently no automated approach to identify intrinsic bugs.To bridge this gap, our study employs Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to automatically identify intrinsic bugs.Specifically, we utilize two embedding techniques, seBERT and TF-IDF, applied to the title and description text of bug reports.The resulting embeddings are fed into well-established machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The primary objective of this paper is to assess the performance of various NLP and machine learning techniques in identifying intrinsic bugs using the textual information extracted from bug reports. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span>The results demonstrate that both seBERT and TF-IDF can be effectively utilized for intrinsic bug identification.The highest performance scores were achieved by combining TF-IDF with the Decision Tree algorithm and utilizing the bug titles (yielding an F1 score of 78%).This was closely followed by seBERT, Support Vector Machine, and bug titles (with an F1 score of 77%).In summary, this paper introduces an innovative approach that automates the identification of intrinsic bugs using textual information derived from bug reports.</p>

                  <p>We address the problem of cluster identity estimation in a personalized federated learning (PFL) setting in which users aim to learn different personal models.The backbone of effective learning in such a setting is to cluster users into groups whose objectives are similar.A typical approach in the literature is to achieve this by training users' data on different proposed personal models and assign them to groups based on which model achieves the lowest value of the users' loss functions.This process is to be done iteratively until group identities converge.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A key challenge in such a setting arises when users have noisy labeled data, which may produce misleading values of their loss functions, and hence lead to ineffective clustering. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.635</span></span>To overcome this challenge, we propose a label-agnostic data similarity-based clustering algorithm, coined RCC-PFL, with three main advantages: the cluster identity estimation procedure is independent from the training labels; it is a one-shot clustering algorithm performed prior to the training; and it requires fewer communication rounds and less computation compared to iterative-based clustering methods.We validate our proposed algorithm using various models and datasets and show that it outperforms multiple baselines in terms of average accuracy and variance reduction.</p>

                  <p>Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) is an intriguing open-world problem that has garnered increasing attention.Given a dataset that includes both labelled and unlabelled images, GCD aims to categorize all images in the unlabelled subset, regardless of whether they belong to known or unknown classes.In GCD, the common practice typically involves applying a spherical projection operator at the end of the self-supervised pretrained backbone, operating within Euclidean or spherical space.However, both of these spaces have been shown to be suboptimal for encoding samples that possesses hierarchical structures.In contrast, hyperbolic space exhibits exponential volume growth relative to radius, making it inherently strong at capturing the hierarchical structure of samples from both seen and unseen categories.Therefore, we propose to tackle the category discovery challenge in the hyperbolic space.We introduce HypCD, a simple \underline{Hyp}erbolic framework for learning hierarchy-aware representations and classifiers for generalized \underline{C}ategory \underline{D}iscovery.HypCD first transforms the Euclidean embedding space of the backbone network into hyperbolic space, facilitating subsequent representation and classification learning by considering both hyperbolic distance and the angle between samples.This approach is particularly helpful for knowledge transfer from known to unknown categories in GCD.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We thoroughly evaluate HypCD on public GCD benchmarks, by applying it to various baseline and state-of-the-art methods, consistently achieving significant improvements. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.676</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) can encode complex relationships in their latent spaces, yet harnessing them for optimization under uncertainty remains challenging.We address this gap with a novel architecture that reframes LLM finetuning as Gaussian process (GP) marginal likelihood optimization via deep kernel methods.We introduce LLM-based deep kernels, jointly optimized with GPs to preserve the benefits of both - LLMs to provide a rich and flexible input space for Bayesian optimization and - GPs to model this space with predictive uncertainty for more efficient sampling.Applied to Buchwald-Hartwig reaction optimization, our method nearly doubles the discovery rate of high-performing reactions compared to static LLM embeddings (from 24% to 43% coverage of the top 5% reactions in just 50 optimization iterations).We also observe a 14% improvement over domain-specific representations without requiring specialized features.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive empirical evaluation across 19 benchmarks - ranging from general chemistry to reaction and molecular property optimization - demonstrates our method's robustness, generality, and consistent improvements across: (1) tasks, (2) LLM architectures (encoder, decoder, encoder-decoder), (3) pretraining domains (chemistry-related or general-purpose) and (4) hyperparameter settings (tuned once on a single dataset). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.63</span></span>Finally, we explain these improvements: joint LLM-GP optimization through marginal likelihood implicitly performs contrastive learning, aligning representations to produce (1) better-structured embedding spaces, (2) improved uncertainty calibration, and (3) more efficient sampling - without requiring any external loss.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This work provides both practical advances in sample-efficient optimization and insights into what makes effective Bayesian optimization. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.655</span></span></p>

                  <p>Open-World Tracking (OWT) aims to track every object of any category, which requires the model to have strong generalization capabilities.Trackers can improve their generalization ability by leveraging Visual Language Models (VLMs).However, challenges arise with the fine-tuning strategies when VLMs are transferred to OWT: full fine-tuning results in excessive parameter and memory costs, while the zero-shot strategy leads to sub-optimal performance.To solve the problem, EffOWT is proposed for efficiently transferring VLMs to OWT.Specifically, we build a small and independent learnable side network outside the VLM backbone.By freezing the backbone and only executing backpropagation on the side network, the model's efficiency requirements can be met.In addition, EffOWT enhances the side network by proposing a hybrid structure of Transformer and CNN to improve the model's performance in the OWT field.Finally, we implement sparse interactions on the MLP, thus reducing parameter updates and memory costs significantly.Thanks to the proposed methods, EffOWT achieves an absolute gain of 5.5% on the tracking metric OWTA for unknown categories, while only updating 1.3% of the parameters compared to full fine-tuning, with a 36.4% memory saving.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Other metrics also demonstrate obvious improvement. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.659</span></span></p>

                  <p>Multimodal 3D object detection based on deep neural networks has indeed made significant progress.However, it still faces challenges due to the misalignment of scale and spatial information between features extracted from 2D images and those derived from 3D point clouds.Existing methods usually aggregate multimodal features at a single stage.However, leveraging multi-stage cross-modal features is crucial for detecting objects of various scales.Therefore, these methods often struggle to integrate features across different scales and modalities effectively, thereby restricting the accuracy of detection.Additionally, the time-consuming Query-Key-Value-based (QKV-based) cross-attention operations often utilized in existing methods aid in reasoning the location and existence of objects by capturing non-local contexts.However, this approach tends to increase computational complexity.To address these challenges, we present SSLFusion, a novel Scale & Space Aligned Latent Fusion Model, consisting of a scale-aligned fusion strategy (SAF), a 3D-to-2D space alignment module (SAM), and a latent cross-modal fusion module (LFM).SAF mitigates scale misalignment between modalities by aggregating features from both images and point clouds across multiple levels.SAM is designed to reduce the inter-modal gap between features from images and point clouds by incorporating 3D coordinate information into 2D image features.Additionally, LFM captures cross-modal non-local contexts in the latent space without utilizing the QKV-based attention operations, thus mitigating computational complexity.Experiments on the KITTI and DENSE datasets demonstrate that our SSLFusion outperforms state-of-the-art methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our approach obtains an absolute gain of 2.15% in 3D AP, compared with the state-of-art method GraphAlign on the moderate level of the KITTI test set. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.641</span></span></p>

                  <p>As deep learning continues to be driven by ever-larger datasets, understanding which examples are most important for generalization has become a critical question.While progress in data selection continues, emerging applications require studying this problem in dynamic contexts.To bridge this gap, we pose the Incremental Data Selection (IDS) problem, where examples arrive as a continuous stream, and need to be selected without access to the full data source.In this setting, the learner must incrementally build a training dataset of predefined size while simultaneously learning the underlying task.We find that in IDS, the impact of a new sample on the model state depends fundamentally on both its geometric relationship in the feature space and its prediction error.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Leveraging this insight, we propose PEAKS (Prediction Error Anchored by Kernel Similarity), an efficient data selection method tailored for IDS. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that PEAKS consistently outperforms existing selection strategies. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.68</span></span>Furthermore, PEAKS yields increasingly better performance returns than random selection as training data size grows on real-world datasets.</p>

                  <p>The problem of computing near-optimal contracts in combinatorial settings has recently attracted significant interest in the computer science community.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Previous work has provided a rich body of structural and algorithmic insights into this problem. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span>However, most of these results rely on the assumption that the principal has an unlimited budget for incentivizing agents, an assumption that is often unrealistic in practice.This motivates the study of the optimal contract problem under budget constraints.We study multi-agent contracts with budget constraints under both binary and combinatorial actions.For binary actions, our contribution is threefold.First, we generalize all previously known approximation guarantees on the principal's revenue to budgeted settings.Second, through the lens of budget constraints, we uncover insightful connections between the standard objective of the principal's revenue and other objectives.We identify a broad class of objectives, which we term BEST objectives, including reward, social welfare, and revenue, and show that they are all equivalent (up to a constant factor), leading to approximation guarantees for all BEST objectives.Third, we introduce the price of frugality, which quantifies the loss due to budget constraints, and establish near-tight bounds on this measure, providing deeper insights into the tradeoffs between budgets and incentives.For combinatorial actions, we establish a strong negative result.Specifically, we show that in a budgeted setting with submodular rewards, no finite approximation is possible to any BEST objective.This stands in contrast to the unbudgeted setting with submodular rewards, where a polynomial-time constant-factor approximation is known for revenue.On the positive side, for gross substitutes rewards, we recover our binary-actions results, obtaining a constant-factor approximation for all BEST objectives.</p>

                  <p>Recent studies have shown that bugs can be categorized into intrinsic and extrinsic types.Intrinsic bugs can be backtracked to specific changes in the version control system (VCS), while extrinsic bugs originate from external changes to the VCS and lack a direct bug-inducing change.Using only intrinsic bugs to train bug prediction models has been reported as beneficial to improve the performance of such models.However, there is currently no automated approach to identify intrinsic bugs.To bridge this gap, our study employs Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to automatically identify intrinsic bugs.Specifically, we utilize two embedding techniques, seBERT and TF-IDF, applied to the title and description text of bug reports.The resulting embeddings are fed into well-established machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors.The primary objective of this paper is to assess the performance of various NLP and machine learning techniques in identifying intrinsic bugs using the textual information extracted from bug reports.The results demonstrate that both seBERT and TF-IDF can be effectively utilized for intrinsic bug identification.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The highest performance scores were achieved by combining TF-IDF with the Decision Tree algorithm and utilizing the bug titles (yielding an F1 score of 78%). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.645</span></span>This was closely followed by seBERT, Support Vector Machine, and bug titles (with an F1 score of 77%).In summary, this paper introduces an innovative approach that automates the identification of intrinsic bugs using textual information derived from bug reports.</p>

                  <p>Much of the federated learning (FL) literature focuses on settings where local dataset statistics remain the same between training and testing time.Recent advances in domain generalization (DG) aim to use data from source (training) domains to train a model that generalizes well to data from unseen target (testing) domains.In this paper, we are motivated by two major gaps in existing work on FL and DG: (1) the lack of formal mathematical analysis of DG objectives and training processes; and (2) DG research in FL being limited to the conventional star-topology architecture.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Addressing the second gap, we develop $\textit{Decentralized Federated Domain Generalization with Style Sharing}$ ($\texttt{StyleDDG}$), a fully decentralized DG algorithm designed to allow devices in a peer-to-peer network to achieve DG based on sharing style information inferred from their datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span>Additionally, we fill the first gap by providing the first systematic approach to mathematically analyzing style-based DG training optimization.We cast existing centralized DG algorithms within our framework, and employ their formalisms to model $\texttt{StyleDDG}$. Based on this, we obtain analytical conditions under which a sub-linear convergence rate of $\texttt{StyleDDG}$ can be obtained.Through experiments on two popular DG datasets, we demonstrate that $\texttt{StyleDDG}$ can obtain significant improvements in accuracy across target domains with minimal added communication overhead compared to decentralized gradient methods that do not employ style sharing.</p>

                  <p>Modern code generation has made significant strides in functional correctness and execution efficiency.However, these systems often overlook a critical dimension in real-world software development: maintainability.To handle dynamic requirements with minimal rework, we propose MaintainCoder as a pioneering solution.It integrates Waterfall model, design patterns, and multi-agent collaboration to systematically enhance cohesion, reduce coupling, and improve adaptability.We also introduce MaintainBench, a benchmark comprising requirement changes and corresponding dynamic metrics on maintainance effort.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments demonstrate that existing code generation methods struggle to meet maintainability standards when requirements evolve. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.622</span></span>In contrast, MaintainCoder improves maintainability metrics by 14-30% with even higher correctness, i.e. pass@k.Our work not only provides the foundation of maintainable code generation, but also highlights the need for more holistic code quality research.Resources: https://github.com/IAAR-Shanghai/MaintainCoder.</p>
