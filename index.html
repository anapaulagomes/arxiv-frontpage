                  <p>Deep learning-based object recognition systems can be easily fooled by various adversarial perturbations.One reason for the weak robustness may be that they do not have part-based inductive bias like the human recognition process.Motivated by this, several part-based recognition models have been proposed to improve the adversarial robustness of recognition.However, due to the lack of part annotations, the effectiveness of these methods is only validated on small-scale nonstandard datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we propose PIN++, short for PartImageNet++, a dataset providing high-quality part segmentation annotations for all categories of ImageNet-1K (IN-1K). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.83</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>With these annotations, we build part-based methods directly on the standard IN-1K dataset for robust recognition. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.72</span></span>Different from previous two-stage part-based models, we propose a Multi-scale Part-supervised Model (MPM), to learn a robust representation with part annotations.Experiments show that MPM yielded better adversarial robustness on the large-scale IN-1K over strong baselines across various attack settings.Furthermore, MPM achieved improved robustness on common corruptions and several out-of-distribution datasets.The dataset, together with these results, enables and encourages researchers to explore the potential of part-based models in more real applications.</p>

                  <p>A key limitation of learned robot control policies is their inability to generalize outside their training data.Recent works on vision-language-action models (VLAs) have shown that the use of large, internet pre-trained vision-language models as the backbone of learned robot policies can substantially improve their robustness and generalization ability.Yet, one of the most exciting capabilities of large vision-language models in other domains is their ability to reason iteratively through complex problems.Can that same capability be brought into robotics to allow policies to improve performance by reasoning about a given task before acting?Naive use of "chain-of-thought" (CoT) style prompting is significantly less effective with standard VLAs because of the relatively simple training examples that are available to them.Additionally, purely semantic reasoning about sub-tasks, as is common in regular CoT, is insufficient for robot policies that need to ground their reasoning in sensory observations and the robot state.To this end, we introduce Embodied Chain-of-Thought Reasoning (ECoT) for VLAs, in which we train VLAs to perform multiple steps of reasoning about plans, sub-tasks, motions, and visually grounded features like object bounding boxes and end effector positions, before predicting the robot action.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We design a scalable pipeline for generating synthetic training data for ECoT on large robot datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.706</span></span>We demonstrate, that ECoT increases the absolute success rate of OpenVLA, the current strongest open-source VLA policy, by 28% across challenging generalization tasks, without any additional robot training data.Additionally, ECoT makes it easier for humans to interpret a policy's failures and correct its behavior using natural language.</p>

                  <p>Top-down Bird's Eye View (BEV) maps are a popular representation for ground robot navigation due to their richness and flexibility for downstream tasks.While recent methods have shown promise for predicting BEV maps from First-Person View (FPV) images, their generalizability is limited to small regions captured by current autonomous vehicle-based datasets.In this context, we show that a more scalable approach towards generalizable map prediction can be enabled by using two large-scale crowd-sourced mapping platforms, Mapillary for FPV images and OpenStreetMap for BEV semantic maps.We introduce Map It Anywhere (MIA), a data engine that enables seamless curation and modeling of labeled map prediction data from existing open-source map platforms.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Using our MIA data engine, we display the ease of automatically collecting a dataset of 1.2 million pairs of FPV images & BEV maps encompassing diverse geographies, landscapes, environmental factors, camera models & capture scenarios. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.86</span></span>We further train a simple camera model-agnostic model on this data for BEV map prediction.Extensive evaluations using established benchmarks and our dataset show that the data curated by MIA enables effective pretraining for generalizable BEV map prediction, with zero-shot performance far exceeding baselines trained on existing datasets by 35%.Our analysis highlights the promise of using large-scale public maps for developing & testing generalizable BEV perception, paving the way for more robust autonomous navigation.</p>

                  <p>Precise positioning and navigation information has been increasingly important with the development of the consumer electronics market.Due to some deficits of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), such as susceptible to interferences, integrating of GNSS with additional alternative sensors is a promising approach to overcome the performance limitations of GNSS-based localization systems.Ultra-Wideband (UWB) can be used to enhance GNSS in constructing an integrated localization system.However, most low-cost UWB devices lack a hardware-level time synchronization feature, which necessitates the estimation and compensation of the time-offset in the tightly coupled GNSS/UWB integration.Given the flexibility of probabilistic graphical models, the time-offset can be modeled as an invariant constant in the discretization of the continuous model.This work proposes a novel architecture in which Factor Graph Optimization (FGO) is hybrid with Extend Kalman Filter (EKF) for tightly coupled GNSS/UWB integration with online Temporal calibration (FE-GUT).FGO is utilized to precisely estimate the time-offset, while EKF provides initailization for the new factors and performs time-offset compensation.Simulation-based experiments validate the integrated localization performance of FE-GUT.In a four-wheeled robot scenario, the results demonstrate that, compared to EKF, FE-GUT can improve horizontal and vertical localization accuracy by 58.59\% and 34.80\%, respectively, while the time-offset estimation accuracy is improved by 76.80\%.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>All the source codes and datasets can be gotten via https://github.com/zhaoqj23/FE-GUT/. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.735</span></span></p>

                  <p>Text-to-image diffusion models have significantly advanced in conditional image generation.However, these models usually struggle with accurately rendering images featuring humans, resulting in distorted limbs and other anomalies.This issue primarily stems from the insufficient recognition and evaluation of limb qualities in diffusion models.To address this issue, we introduce AbHuman, the first large-scale synthesized human benchmark focusing on anatomical anomalies.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This benchmark consists of 56K synthesized human images, each annotated with detailed, bounding-box level labels identifying 147K human anomalies in 18 different categories. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.955</span></span>Based on this, the recognition of human anomalies can be established, which in turn enhances image generation through traditional techniques such as negative prompting and guidance.To further boost the improvement, we propose HumanRefiner, a novel plug-and-play approach for the coarse-to-fine refinement of human anomalies in text-to-image generation.Specifically, HumanRefiner utilizes a self-diagnostic procedure to detect and correct issues related to both coarse-grained abnormal human poses and fine-grained anomaly levels, facilitating pose-reversible diffusion generation.Experimental results on the AbHuman benchmark demonstrate that HumanRefiner significantly reduces generative discrepancies, achieving a 2.9x improvement in limb quality compared to the state-of-the-art open-source generator SDXL and a 1.4x improvement over DALL-E 3 in human evaluations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our data and code are available at https://github.com/Enderfga/HumanRefiner. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.731</span></span></p>

                  <p>This study explores the transfer learning capabilities of the TrOCR architecture to Spanish.TrOCR is a transformer-based Optical Character Recognition (OCR) model renowned for its state-of-the-art performance in English benchmarks.Inspired by Li et al. assertion regarding its adaptability to multilingual text recognition, we investigate two distinct approaches to adapt the model to a new language: integrating an English TrOCR encoder with a language specific decoder and train the model on this specific language, and fine-tuning the English base TrOCR model on a new language data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Due to the scarcity of publicly available datasets, we present a resource-efficient pipeline for creating OCR datasets in any language, along with a comprehensive benchmark of the different image generation methods employed with a focus on Visual Rich Documents (VRDs). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.836</span></span>Additionally, we offer a comparative analysis of the two approaches for the Spanish language, demonstrating that fine-tuning the English TrOCR on Spanish yields superior recognition than the language specific decoder for a fixed dataset size.We evaluate our model employing character and word error rate metrics on a public available printed dataset, comparing the performance against other open-source and cloud OCR spanish models.As far as we know, these resources represent the best open-source model for OCR in Spanish.The Spanish TrOCR models are publicly available on HuggingFace<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>[20] and the code to generate the dataset is available on Github <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.915</span></span>[25].</p>

                  <p>Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) simplifies querying vast amounts of knowledge stored in a graph-based model using natural language.However, the research has largely concentrated on English, putting non-English speakers at a disadvantage.Meanwhile, existing multilingual KGQA systems face challenges in achieving performance comparable to English systems, highlighting the difficulty of generating SPARQL queries from diverse languages.In this research, we propose a simplified approach to enhance multilingual KGQA systems by incorporating linguistic context and entity information directly into the processing pipeline of a language model.Unlike existing methods that rely on separate encoders for integrating auxiliary information, our strategy leverages a single, pretrained multilingual transformer-based language model to manage both the primary input and the auxiliary data.Our methodology significantly improves the language model's ability to accurately convert a natural language query into a relevant SPARQL query.It demonstrates promising results on the most recent QALD datasets, namely QALD-9-Plus and QALD-10.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we introduce and evaluate our approach on Chinese and Japanese, thereby expanding the language diversity of the existing datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.707</span></span></p>

                  <p>Class incremental learning (CIL) aims to learn a model that can not only incrementally accommodate new classes, but also maintain the learned knowledge of old classes.Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in CIL is to retain this incremental learning ability, while being able to reject unknown samples that are drawn from different distributions of the learned classes.This capability is crucial to the safety of deploying CIL models in open worlds.However, despite remarkable advancements in the respective CIL and OOD detection, there lacks a systematic and large-scale benchmark to assess the capability of advanced CIL models in detecting OOD samples.To fill this gap, in this study we design a comprehensive empirical study to establish such a benchmark, named $\textbf{OpenCIL}$. To this end, we propose two principled frameworks for enabling four representative CIL models with 15 diverse OOD detection methods, resulting in 60 baseline models for OOD detection in CIL.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The empirical evaluation is performed on two popular CIL datasets with six commonly-used OOD datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.712</span></span>One key observation we find through our comprehensive evaluation is that the CIL models can be severely biased towards the OOD samples and newly added classes when they are exposed to open environments.Motivated by this, we further propose a new baseline for OOD detection in CIL, namely Bi-directional Energy Regularization ($\textbf{BER}$), which is specially designed to mitigate these two biases in different CIL models by having energy regularization on both old and new classes.Its superior performance is justified in our experiments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>All codes and datasets are open-source at $https://github.com/mala-lab/OpenCIL$. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.849</span></span></p>

                  <p>Domain adaptive semantic segmentation aims to generate accurate and dense predictions for an unlabeled target domain by leveraging a supervised model trained on a labeled source domain.The prevalent self-training approach involves retraining the dense discriminative classifier of $p(class|pixel feature)$ using the pseudo-labels from the target domain.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While many methods focus on mitigating the issue of noisy pseudo-labels, they often overlook the underlying data distribution p(pixel feature|class) in both the source and target domains. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.658</span></span>To address this limitation, we propose the multi-prototype Gaussian-Mixture-based (ProtoGMM) model, which incorporates the GMM into contrastive losses to perform guided contrastive learning.Contrastive losses are commonly executed in the literature using memory banks, which can lead to class biases due to underrepresented classes.Furthermore, memory banks often have fixed capacities, potentially restricting the model's ability to capture diverse representations of the target/source domains.An alternative approach is to use global class prototypes (i.e. averaged features per category).However, the global prototypes are based on the unimodal distribution assumption per class, disregarding within-class variation.To address these challenges, we propose the ProtoGMM model.This novel approach involves estimating the underlying multi-prototype source distribution by utilizing the GMM on the feature space of the source samples.The components of the GMM model act as representative prototypes.To achieve increased intra-class semantic similarity, decreased inter-class similarity, and domain alignment between the source and target domains, we employ multi-prototype contrastive learning between source distribution and target samples.The experiments show the effectiveness of our method on UDA benchmarks.</p>

                  <p>After a machine learning model has been deployed into production, its predictive performance needs to be monitored.Ideally, such monitoring can be carried out by comparing the model's predictions against ground truth labels.For this to be possible, the ground truth labels must be available relatively soon after inference.However, there are many use cases where ground truth labels are available only after a significant delay, or in the worst case, not at all.In such cases, directly monitoring the model's predictive performance is impossible.   Recently, novel methods for estimating the predictive performance of a model when ground truth is unavailable have been developed.Many of these methods leverage model confidence or other uncertainty estimates and are experimentally compared against a naive baseline method, namely Average Confidence (AC), which estimates model accuracy as the average of confidence scores for a given set of predictions.However, until now the theoretical properties of the AC method have not been properly explored.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we try to fill this gap by reviewing the AC method and show that under certain general assumptions, it is an unbiased and consistent estimator of model accuracy with many desirable properties. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.653</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also compare this baseline estimator against some more complex estimators empirically and show that in many cases the AC method is able to beat the others, although the comparative quality of the different estimators is heavily case-dependent. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.727</span></span></p>

                  <p>Time-series data processing is an important component of many real-world applications, such as health monitoring, environmental monitoring, and digital agriculture.These applications collect distinct windows of sensor data (e.g., few seconds) and process them to assess the environment.Machine learning (ML) models are being employed in time-series applications due to their generalization abilities for classification.State-of-the-art time-series applications wait for entire sensor data window to become available before processing the data using ML algorithms, resulting in high sensor energy consumption.However, not all situations require processing full sensor window to make accurate inference.For instance, in activity recognition, sitting and standing activities can be inferred with partial windows.Using this insight, we propose to employ early exit classifiers with partial sensor windows to minimize energy consumption while maintaining accuracy.Specifically, we first utilize multiple early exits with successively increasing amount of data as they become available in a window.If early exits provide inference with high confidence, we return the label and enter low power mode for sensors.The proposed approach has potential to enable significant energy savings in time series applications.We utilize neural networks and random forest classifiers to evaluate our approach.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our evaluations with six datasets show that the proposed approach enables up to 50-60% energy savings on average without any impact on accuracy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.612</span></span>The energy savings can enable time-series applications in remote locations with limited energy availability.</p>

                  <p>Neural surfaces (e.g., neural map encoding, deep implicits and neural radiance fields) have recently gained popularity because of their generic structure (e.g., multi-layer perceptron) and easy integration with modern learning-based setups.Traditionally, we have a rich toolbox of geometry processing algorithms designed for polygonal meshes to analyze and operate on surface geometry.However, neural representations are typically discretized and converted into a mesh, before applying any geometry processing algorithm.This is unsatisfactory and, as we demonstrate, unnecessary.In this work, we propose a spherical neural surface representation (a spherical parametrization) for genus-0 surfaces and demonstrate how to compute core geometric operators directly on this representation.Namely, we show how to construct the normals and the first and second fundamental forms of the surface, and how to compute the surface gradient, surface divergence and Laplace Beltrami operator on scalar/vector fields defined on the surface.These operators, in turn, enable us to create geometry processing tools that act directly on the neural representations without any unnecessary meshing.We demonstrate illustrative applications in (neural) spectral analysis, heat flow and mean curvature flow, and our method shows robustness to isometric shape variations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We both propose theoretical formulations and validate their numerical estimates. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.635</span></span>By systematically linking neural surface representations with classical geometry processing algorithms, we believe this work can become a key ingredient in enabling neural geometry processing.</p>

                  <p>Handwritten Mathematical Expression Recognition (HMER) has wide applications in human-machine interaction scenarios, such as digitized education and automated offices.Recently, sequence-based models with encoder-decoder architectures have been commonly adopted to address this task by directly predicting LaTeX sequences of expression images.However, these methods only implicitly learn the syntax rules provided by LaTeX, which may fail to describe the position and hierarchical relationship between symbols due to complex structural relations and diverse handwriting styles.To overcome this challenge, we propose a position forest transformer (PosFormer) for HMER, which jointly optimizes two tasks: expression recognition and position recognition, to explicitly enable position-aware symbol feature representation learning.Specifically, we first design a position forest that models the mathematical expression as a forest structure and parses the relative position relationships between symbols.Without requiring extra annotations, each symbol is assigned a position identifier in the forest to denote its relative spatial position.Second, we propose an implicit attention correction module to accurately capture attention for HMER in the sequence-based decoder architecture.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments validate the superiority of PosFormer, which consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods 2.03%/1.22%/2.00%, 1.83%, and 4.62% gains on the single-line CROHME 2014/2016/2019, multi-line M2E, and complex MNE datasets, respectively, with no additional latency or computational cost. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.607</span></span>Code is available at https://github.com/SJTU-DeepVisionLab/PosFormer.</p>

                  <p>The approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) is a fundamental and essential component in information retrieval, with graph-based methodologies demonstrating superior performance compared to alternative approaches.Extensive research efforts have been dedicated to improving search efficiency by developing various graph-based indices, such as HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World).However, the performance of HNSW and most graph-based indices becomes unacceptable when faced with a large number of real-time deletions, insertions, and updates.Furthermore, during update operations, HNSW can result in some data points becoming unreachable, a situation we refer to as the `unreachable points phenomenon'.This phenomenon could significantly affect the search accuracy of the graph in certain situations.   To address these issues, we present efficient measures to overcome the shortcomings of HNSW, specifically addressing poor performance over long periods of delete and update operations and resolving the issues caused by the unreachable points phenomenon.Our proposed MN-RU algorithm effectively improves update efficiency and suppresses the growth rate of unreachable points, ensuring better overall performance and maintaining the integrity of the graph.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results demonstrate that our methods outperform existing approaches. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.682</span></span>Furthermore, since our methods are based on HNSW, they can be easily integrated with existing indices widely used in the industrial field, making them practical for future real-world applications.Code is available at https://github.com/xwt1/ICPADS-MN-RU.git</p>

                  <p>A dynamic graph algorithm is a data structure that supports edge insertions, deletions, and specific problem queries.While extensive research exists on dynamic algorithms for graph problems solvable in polynomial time, most of these algorithms have not been implemented or empirically evaluated.   This work addresses the NP-complete maximum weight and cardinality independent set problems in a dynamic setting, applicable to areas like dynamic map-labeling and vehicle routing.Real-world instances can be vast, with millions of vertices and edges, making it challenging to find near-optimal solutions quickly.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Exact solvers can find optimal solutions but have exponential worst-case runtimes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.608</span></span>Conversely, heuristic algorithms use local search techniques to improve solutions by optimizing vertices.   In this work, we introduce a novel local search technique called optimal neighborhood exploration.This technique creates independent subproblems that are solved to optimality, leading to improved overall solutions.Through numerous experiments, we assess the effectiveness of our approach and compare it with other state-of-the-art dynamic solvers.Our algorithm features a parameter, the subproblem size, that balances running time and solution quality.With this parameter, our configuration matches state-of-the-art performance for the cardinality independent set problem.By increasing the parameter, we significantly enhance solution quality.</p>

                  <p>Edge computing promises to offer low-latency and ubiquitous computation to numerous devices at the network edge.For delay-sensitive applications, link delays can have a direct impact on service quality.These delays can fluctuate drastically over time due to various factors such as network congestion, changing traffic conditions, cyberattacks, component failures, and natural disasters.Thus, it is crucial to efficiently harden the edge network to mitigate link delay variation as well as ensure a stable and improved user experience.To this end, we propose a novel robust model for optimal edge network hardening, considering the link delay uncertainty.Departing from the existing literature that treats uncertainties as exogenous, our model incorporates an endogenous uncertainty set to properly capture the impact of hardening and workload allocation decisions on link delays.However, the endogenous set introduces additional complexity to the problem due to the interdependence between decisions and uncertainties.We present two efficient methods to transform the problem into a solvable form.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive numerical results are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.749</span></span></p>

                  <p>Data science and engineering workflows often span multiple stages, from warehousing to orchestration, using tools like BigQuery, dbt, and Airbyte.As vision language models (VLMs) advance in multimodal understanding and code generation, VLM-based agents could potentially automate these workflows by generating SQL queries, Python code, and GUI operations.This automation can improve the productivity of experts while democratizing access to large-scale data analysis.In this paper, we introduce Spider2-V, the first multimodal agent benchmark focusing on professional data science and engineering workflows, featuring 494 real-world tasks in authentic computer environments and incorporating 20 enterprise-level professional applications.These tasks, derived from real-world use cases, evaluate the ability of a multimodal agent to perform data-related tasks by writing code and managing the GUI in enterprise data software systems.To balance realistic simulation with evaluation simplicity, we devote significant effort to developing automatic configurations for task setup and carefully crafting evaluation metrics for each task.Furthermore, we supplement multimodal agents with comprehensive documents of these enterprise data software systems.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our empirical evaluation reveals that existing state-of-the-art LLM/VLM-based agents do not reliably automate full data workflows (14.0% success). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span>Even with step-by-step guidance, these agents still underperform in tasks that require fine-grained, knowledge-intensive GUI actions (16.2%) and involve remote cloud-hosted workspaces (10.6%).We hope that Spider2-V paves the way for autonomous multimodal agents to transform the automation of data science and engineering workflow.Our code and data are available at https://spider2-v.github.io.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are gaining momentum in software development with prompt-driven programming enabling developers to create code from natural language (NL) instructions.However, studies have questioned their ability to produce secure code and, thereby, the quality of prompt-generated software.Alongside, various prompting techniques that carefully tailor prompts have emerged to elicit optimal responses from LLMs.Still, the interplay between such prompting strategies and secure code generation remains under-explored and calls for further investigations.OBJECTIVE:In this study, we investigate the impact of different prompting techniques on the security of code generated from NL instructions by LLMs.METHOD:<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>First we perform a systematic literature review to identify the existing prompting techniques that can be used for code generation tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.646</span></span>A subset of these techniques are evaluated on GPT-3, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 models for secure code generation.For this, we used an existing dataset consisting of 150 NL security-relevant code-generation prompts.RESULTS:Our work (i) classifies potential prompting techniques for code generation (ii) adapts and evaluates a subset of the identified techniques for secure code generation tasks and (iii) observes a reduction in security weaknesses across the tested LLMs, especially after using an existing technique called Recursive Criticism and Improvement (RCI), contributing valuable insights to the ongoing discourse on LLM-generated code security.</p>

To address this gap, our study evaluated 14 distinct embedding models to gain insights into the effects of various design choices.Subsequently, we developed bug localization models utilizing these embedding models to assess the influence of these choices on the performance of the localization models.Our findings indicate that the pre-training strategies significantly affect the quality of the embedding.Moreover, we discovered that the familiarity of the embedding models with the data has a notable impact on the bug localization model's performance.Notably, when the training and testing data are collected from different projects, the performance of the bug localization models exhibits substantial fluctuations.</p>
