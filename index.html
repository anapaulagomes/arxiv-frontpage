                  <p>Current conversational recommendation systems focus predominantly on text.However, real-world recommendation settings are generally multimodal, causing a significant gap between existing research and practical applications.To address this issue, we propose Muse, the first multimodal conversational recommendation dataset.Muse comprises 83,148 utterances from 7,000 conversations centered around the Clothing domain.Each conversation contains comprehensive multimodal interactions, rich elements, and natural dialogues.Data in Muse are automatically synthesized by a multi-agent framework powered by multimodal large language models (MLLMs).It innovatively derives user profiles from real-world scenarios rather than depending on manual design and history data for better scalability, and then it fulfills conversation simulation and optimization.Both human and LLM evaluations demonstrate the high quality of conversations in Muse.Additionally, fine-tuning experiments on three MLLMs demonstrate Muse's learnable patterns for recommendations and responses, confirming its value for multimodal conversational recommendation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our dataset and codes are available at \url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Muse-0086}. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.811</span></span></p>

                  <p>In this work, we introduce GauSim, a novel neural network-based simulator designed to capture the dynamic behaviors of real-world elastic objects represented through Gaussian kernels.Unlike traditional methods that treat kernels as particles within particle-based simulations, we leverage continuum mechanics, modeling each kernel as a continuous piece of matter to account for realistic deformations without idealized assumptions.To improve computational efficiency and fidelity, we employ a hierarchical structure that organizes kernels into Center of Mass Systems (CMS) with explicit formulations, enabling a coarse-to-fine simulation approach.This structure significantly reduces computational overhead while preserving detailed dynamics.In addition, GauSim incorporates explicit physics constraints, such as mass and momentum conservation, ensuring interpretable results and robust, physically plausible simulations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To validate our approach, we present a new dataset, READY, containing multi-view videos of real-world elastic deformations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.705</span></span>Experimental results demonstrate that GauSim achieves superior performance compared to existing physics-driven baselines, offering a practical and accurate solution for simulating complex dynamic behaviors.Code and model will be released.Project page: https://www.mmlab-ntu.com/project/gausim/index.html .</p>

                  <p>Referring Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT) is an important topic in the current tracking field.Its task form is to guide the tracker to track objects that match the language description.Current research mainly focuses on referring multi-object tracking under single-view, which refers to a view sequence or multiple unrelated view sequences.However, in the single-view, some appearances of objects are easily invisible, resulting in incorrect matching of objects with the language description.In this work, we propose a new task, called Cross-view Referring Multi-Object Tracking (CRMOT).It introduces the cross-view to obtain the appearances of objects from multiple views, avoiding the problem of the invisible appearances of objects in RMOT task.CRMOT is a more challenging task of accurately tracking the objects that match the language description and maintaining the identity consistency of objects in each cross-view.To advance CRMOT task, we construct a cross-view referring multi-object tracking benchmark based on CAMPUS and DIVOTrack datasets, named CRTrack.Specifically, it provides 13 different scenes and 221 language descriptions.Furthermore, we propose an end-to-end cross-view referring multi-object tracking method, named CRTracker.Extensive experiments on the CRTrack benchmark verify the effectiveness of our method.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/chen-si-jia/CRMOT. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.852</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent 3D content generation pipelines commonly employ Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to encode shapes into compact latent representations for diffusion-based generation.However, the widely adopted uniform point sampling strategy in Shape VAE training often leads to a significant loss of geometric details, limiting the quality of shape reconstruction and downstream generation tasks.We present Dora-VAE, a novel approach that enhances VAE reconstruction through our proposed sharp edge sampling strategy and a dual cross-attention mechanism.By identifying and prioritizing regions with high geometric complexity during training, our method significantly improves the preservation of fine-grained shape features.Such sampling strategy and the dual attention mechanism enable the VAE to focus on crucial geometric details that are typically missed by uniform sampling approaches.To systematically evaluate VAE reconstruction quality, we additionally propose Dora-bench, a benchmark that quantifies shape complexity through the density of sharp edges, introducing a new metric focused on reconstruction accuracy at these salient geometric features.Extensive experiments on the Dora-bench demonstrate that Dora-VAE achieves comparable reconstruction quality to the state-of-the-art dense XCube-VAE while requiring a latent space at least 8$\times$ smaller (1,280 vs. > 10,000 codes).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We will release our code and benchmark dataset to facilitate future research in 3D shape modeling. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.731</span></span></p>

                  <p>Determining the sustainability impact of companies is a highly complex subject which has garnered more and more attention over the past few years.Today, investors largely rely on sustainability-ratings from established rating-providers in order to analyze how responsibly a company acts.However, those ratings have recently been criticized for being hard to understand and nearly impossible to reproduce.   An independent way to find out about the sustainability practices of companies lies in the rich landscape of news article data.In this paper, we explore a different approach to identify key opportunities and challenges of companies in the sustainability domain.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We present a novel dataset of more than 840,000 news articles which were gathered for major German companies between January 2023 and September 2024. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.859</span></span>By applying a mixture of Natural Language Processing techniques, we first identify relevant articles, before summarizing them and extracting their sustainability-related sentiment and aspect using Large Language Models (LLMs).Furthermore, we conduct an evaluation of the obtained data and determine that the LLM-produced answers are accurate.We release both datasets at https://github.com/Bailefan/Nano-ESG.</p>

P\'olya in 1949, which can serve as a blueprint for datasets that offer a better proof learning signal, alleviating some of the mentioned limitations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Lastly, we introduce math datasheets for datasets, extending the general, dataset-agnostic variants of datasheets: We provide a questionnaire designed specifically for math datasets that we urge dataset creators to include with their datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.772</span></span>This will make creators aware of potential limitations of their datasets while at the same time making it easy for readers to assess it from the point of view of training and evaluating mathematical copilots.</p>

                  <p>We propose scaling up 3D scene reconstruction by training with synthesized data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>At the core of our work is MegaSynth, a procedurally generated 3D dataset comprising 700K scenes - over 50 times larger than the prior real dataset DL3DV - dramatically scaling the training data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.785</span></span>To enable scalable data generation, our key idea is eliminating semantic information, removing the need to model complex semantic priors such as object affordances and scene composition.Instead, we model scenes with basic spatial structures and geometry primitives, offering scalability.Besides, we control data complexity to facilitate training while loosely aligning it with real-world data distribution to benefit real-world generalization.We explore training LRMs with both MegaSynth and available real data.Experiment results show that joint training or pre-training with MegaSynth improves reconstruction quality by 1.2 to 1.8 dB PSNR across diverse image domains.Moreover, models trained solely on MegaSynth perform comparably to those trained on real data, underscoring the low-level nature of 3D reconstruction.Additionally, we provide an in-depth analysis of MegaSynth's properties for enhancing model capability, training stability, and generalization.</p>

                  <p>Recent progress in generative diffusion models has greatly advanced text-to-video generation.While text-to-video models trained on large-scale, diverse datasets can produce varied outputs, these generations often deviate from user preferences, highlighting the need for preference alignment on pre-trained models.Although Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has demonstrated significant improvements in language and image generation, we pioneer its adaptation to video diffusion models and propose a VideoDPO pipeline by making several key adjustments.Unlike previous image alignment methods that focus solely on either (i) visual quality or (ii) semantic alignment between text and videos, we comprehensively consider both dimensions and construct a preference score accordingly, which we term the OmniScore.We design a pipeline to automatically collect preference pair data based on the proposed OmniScore and discover that re-weighting these pairs based on the score significantly impacts overall preference alignment.Our experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in both visual quality and semantic alignment, ensuring that no preference aspect is neglected.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code and data will be shared at https://videodpo.github.io/. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.708</span></span></p>

                  <p>Model inversion attacks pose a significant privacy threat to machine learning models by reconstructing sensitive data from their outputs.While various defenses have been proposed to counteract these attacks, they often come at the cost of the classifier's utility, thus creating a challenging trade-off between privacy protection and model utility.Moreover, most existing defenses require retraining the classifier for enhanced robustness, which is impractical for large-scale, well-established models.This paper introduces a novel defense mechanism to better balance privacy and utility, particularly against adversaries who employ a machine learning model (i.e., inversion model) to reconstruct private data.Drawing inspiration from data poisoning attacks, which can compromise the performance of machine learning models, we propose a strategy that leverages data poisoning to contaminate the training data of inversion models, thereby preventing model inversion attacks.   Two defense methods are presented.The first, termed label-preserving poisoning attacks for all output vectors (LPA), involves subtle perturbations to all output vectors while preserving their labels.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings demonstrate that these minor perturbations, introduced through a data poisoning approach, significantly increase the difficulty of data reconstruction without compromising the utility of the classifier. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>Subsequently, we introduce a second method, label-flipping poisoning for partial output vectors (LFP), which selectively perturbs a small subset of output vectors and alters their labels during the process.Empirical results indicate that LPA is notably effective, outperforming the current state-of-the-art defenses.Our data poisoning-based defense provides a new retraining-free defense paradigm that preserves the victim classifier's utility.</p>

                  <p>ImageNet, an influential dataset in computer vision, is traditionally evaluated using single-label classification, which assumes that an image can be adequately described by a single concept or label.However, this approach may not fully capture the complex semantics within the images available in ImageNet, potentially hindering the development of models that effectively learn these intricacies.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This study critically examines the prevalent single-label benchmarking approach and advocates for a shift to multi-label benchmarking for ImageNet. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.608</span></span>This shift would enable a more comprehensive assessment of the capabilities of deep neural network (DNN) models.We analyze the effectiveness of pre-trained state-of-the-art DNNs on ImageNet and one of its variants, ImageNetV2.Studies in the literature have reported unexpected accuracy drops of 11% to 14% on ImageNetV2.Our findings show that these reported declines are largely attributable to a characteristic of the dataset that has not received sufficient attention -- the proportion of images with multiple labels.Taking this characteristic into account, the results of our experiments provide evidence that there is no substantial degradation in effectiveness on ImageNetV2.Furthermore, we acknowledge that ImageNet pre-trained models exhibit some capability at capturing the multi-label nature of the dataset even though they were trained under the single-label assumption.Consequently, we propose a new evaluation approach to augment existing approaches that assess this capability.Our findings highlight the importance of considering the multi-label nature of the ImageNet dataset during benchmarking.Failing to do so could lead to incorrect conclusions regarding the effectiveness of DNNs and divert research efforts from addressing other substantial challenges related to the reliability and robustness of these models.</p>

                  <p>The core of the Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) task is to predict and complete the missing relations or nodes in a KG.Common KGC tasks are mostly about inferring unknown elements with one or two elements being known in a triple.In comparison, the Triple Set Prediction (TSP) task is a more realistic knowledge graph completion task.It aims to predict all elements of unknown triples based on the information from known triples.In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have exhibited significant advancements in language comprehension, demonstrating considerable potential for KGC tasks.However, the potential of LLM on the TSP task has not yet to be investigated.Thus in this paper we proposed a new framework to explore the strengths and limitations of LLM in the TSP task.Specifically, the framework consists of LLM-based rule mining and LLM-based triple set prediction.The relation list of KG embedded within rich semantic information is first leveraged to prompt LLM in the generation of rules.This process is both efficient and independent of statistical information, making it easier to mine effective and realistic rules.For each subgraph, the specified rule is applied in conjunction with the relevant triples within that subgraph to guide the LLM in predicting the missing triples.Subsequently, the predictions from all subgraphs are consolidated to derive the complete set of predicted triples on KG.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, the method is evaluated on the relatively complete CFamily dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span>The experimental results indicate that when LLMs are required to adhere to a large amount of factual knowledge to predict missing triples, significant hallucinations occurs, leading to a noticeable decline in performance.To further explore the causes of this phenomenon, this paper presents a comprehensive analysis supported by a detailed case study.</p>

                  <p>Association rules are an important technique for gaining insights over large relational datasets consisting of tuples of elements (i.e. attribute-value pairs).However, it is difficult to explain the relative importance of data elements with respect to the rules in which they appear.This paper develops a measure of an element's contribution to a set of association rules based on Shapley values, denoted SHARQ (ShApley Rules Quantification).As is the case with many Shapely-based computations, the cost of a naive calculation of the score is exponential in the number of elements.To that end, we present an efficient framework for computing the exact SharQ value of a single element whose running time is practically linear in the number of rules.Going one step further, we develop an efficient multi-element SHARQ algorithm which amortizes the cost of the single element SHARQ calculation over a set of elements.Based on the definition of SHARQ for elements we describe two additional use cases for association rules explainability: rule importance and attribute importance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments over a novel benchmark dataset containing 45 instances of mined rule sets show the effectiveness of our approach. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span></p>

                  <p>Deep learning-based 3D imaging, in particular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), is challenging because of limited availability of 3D training data.Therefore, 2D diffusion models trained on 2D slices are starting to be leveraged for 3D MRI reconstruction.However, as we show in this paper, existing methods pertain to a fixed voxel size, and performance degrades when the voxel size is varied, as it is often the case in clinical practice.In this paper, we propose and study several approaches for resolution-robust 3D MRI reconstruction with 2D diffusion priors.As a result of this investigation, we obtain a simple resolution-robust variational 3D reconstruction approach based on diffusion-guided regularization of randomly sampled 2D slices.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This method provides competitive reconstruction quality compared to posterior sampling baselines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.648</span></span>Towards resolving the sensitivity to resolution-shifts, we investigate state-of-the-art model-based approaches including Gaussian splatting, neural representations, and infinite-dimensional diffusion models, as well as a simple data-centric approach of training the diffusion model on several resolutions.Our experiments demonstrate that the model-based approaches fail to close the performance gap in 3D MRI.In contrast, the data-centric approach of training the diffusion model on various resolutions effectively provides a resolution-robust method without compromising accuracy.</p>

                  <p>Traditional analyses of gradient descent optimization show that, when the largest eigenvalue of the loss Hessian - often referred to as the sharpness - is below a critical learning-rate threshold, then training is 'stable' and training loss decreases monotonically.Recent studies, however, have suggested that the majority of modern deep neural networks achieve good performance despite operating outside this stable regime.In this work, we demonstrate that such instabilities, induced by large learning rates, move model parameters toward flatter regions of the loss landscape.Our crucial insight lies in noting that, during these instabilities, the orientation of the Hessian eigenvectors rotate.This, we conjecture, allows the model to explore regions of the loss landscape that display more desirable geometrical properties for generalization, such as flatness.These rotations are a consequence of network depth, and we prove that for any network with depth > 1, unstable growth in parameters cause rotations in the principal components of the Hessian, which promote exploration of the parameter space away from unstable directions.Our empirical studies reveal an implicit regularization effect in gradient descent with large learning rates operating beyond the stability threshold.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We find these lead to excellent generalization performance on modern benchmark datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.669</span></span></p>

                  <p>Learning a robust video Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is essential for reducing video redundancy and facilitating efficient video generation.Directly applying image VAEs to individual frames in isolation can result in temporal inconsistencies and suboptimal compression rates due to a lack of temporal compression.Existing Video VAEs have begun to address temporal compression; however, they often suffer from inadequate reconstruction performance.In this paper, we present a novel and powerful video autoencoder capable of high-fidelity video encoding.First, we observe that entangling spatial and temporal compression by merely extending the image VAE to a 3D VAE can introduce motion blur and detail distortion artifacts.Thus, we propose temporal-aware spatial compression to better encode and decode the spatial information.Additionally, we integrate a lightweight motion compression model for further temporal compression.Second, we propose to leverage the textual information inherent in text-to-video datasets and incorporate text guidance into our model.This significantly enhances reconstruction quality, particularly in terms of detail preservation and temporal stability.Third, we further improve the versatility of our model through joint training on both images and videos, which not only enhances reconstruction quality but also enables the model to perform both image and video autoencoding.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive evaluations against strong recent baselines demonstrate the superior performance of our method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.825</span></span>The project website can be found at~\href{https://yzxing87.github.io/vae/}{https://yzxing87.github.io/vae/}.</p>

                  <p>Referring Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT) is an important topic in the current tracking field.Its task form is to guide the tracker to track objects that match the language description.Current research mainly focuses on referring multi-object tracking under single-view, which refers to a view sequence or multiple unrelated view sequences.However, in the single-view, some appearances of objects are easily invisible, resulting in incorrect matching of objects with the language description.In this work, we propose a new task, called Cross-view Referring Multi-Object Tracking (CRMOT).It introduces the cross-view to obtain the appearances of objects from multiple views, avoiding the problem of the invisible appearances of objects in RMOT task.CRMOT is a more challenging task of accurately tracking the objects that match the language description and maintaining the identity consistency of objects in each cross-view.To advance CRMOT task, we construct a cross-view referring multi-object tracking benchmark based on CAMPUS and DIVOTrack datasets, named CRTrack.Specifically, it provides 13 different scenes and 221 language descriptions.Furthermore, we propose an end-to-end cross-view referring multi-object tracking method, named CRTracker.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on the CRTrack benchmark verify the effectiveness of our method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.788</span></span>The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/chen-si-jia/CRMOT.</p>

                  <p>In the realm of Text-Based Person Search (TBPS), mainstream methods aim to explore more efficient interaction frameworks between text descriptions and visual data.However, recent approaches encounter two principal challenges.Firstly, the widely used random-based Masked Language Modeling (MLM) considers all the words in the text equally during training.However, massive semantically vacuous words ('with', 'the', etc.) be masked fail to contribute efficient interaction in the cross-modal MLM and hampers the representation alignment.Secondly, manual descriptions in TBPS datasets are tedious and inevitably contain several inaccuracies.To address these issues, we introduce an Attention-Guided Alignment (AGA) framework featuring two innovative components: Attention-Guided Mask (AGM)Modeling and Text Enrichment Module (TEM).AGM dynamically masks semantically meaningful words by aggregating the attention weight derived from the text encoding process, thereby cross-modal MLM can capture information related to the masked word from text context and images and align their representations.Meanwhile, TEM alleviates low-quality representations caused by repetitive and erroneous text descriptions by replacing those semantically meaningful words with MLM's prediction.It not only enriches text descriptions but also prevents overfitting.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments across three challenging benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our AGA, achieving new state-of-the-art results with Rank-1 accuracy reaching 78.36%, 67.31%, and 67.4% on CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, and RSTPReid, respectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.679</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recently, an increasing number of AI-driven programming assistants powered by code LLMs have been integrated into various real-world software development environments, significantly boosting developer productivity.However, existing code generation benchmarks primarily focus on general-purpose scenarios, leaving the code generation performance of LLMs for specific application domains largely unknown.In this paper, we introduce a new benchmark, MultiCodeBench, to fill this gap.MultiCodeBench comprises 2,400 programming tasks, covering 12 popular software development domains and 15 programming languages.Specifically, we perform in-depth research to identify these 12 application domains.Given that each domain may involve multiple technical frameworks, and that different frameworks present distinct challenges in the coding process, we categorize the commonly used frameworks and platforms within each domain.We then sample programming problems from GitHub repositories related to these subdomains.To ensure the quality of the tasks and mitigate data leakage issues, we invite annotators to rewrite the docstrings for each task in MultiCodeBench.Additionally, we build a static analysis-based dependency parsing tool to extract the dependencies in the ground truth for each task, enabling deeper performance analysis.Through extensive experiments on MultiCodeBench with eleven representative mainstream LLMs, we reveal the code generation performance of the LLMs across different application domains, providing practical insights for developers in downstream fields when selecting LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we analyze the reasons behind the models' failures in completing software application development tasks, offering guidance for model developers to enhance domain-specific code generation capabilities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span></p>

                  <p>Internship and industry-affiliated capstone projects are popular ways to expose students to real world experience and bridge the gap between academic training and industry requirements.However, these two approaches often require active industry collaboration and many students often struggle to find industry placements.Open-source contributions is a crucial alternative to gain real world experience, earn publicly verifiable contribution with real world impact, and learn from experienced open-source contributors.The Google Summer of Code is a global initiative that matches students or new contributors with experienced mentors to work on open-source projects.The goal of the program is to introduce the students to open-source, help gain valuable skills under the guidance of a mentor, and hopefully continue to contribute to open source development; thereby, provide a continuous pool of talented new contributors necessary for maintaining an open source project.This study presents an empirical analysis of pull requests created by interns during the Google Summer of Code program.We extracted and analysed 17,232 pull requests from 2456 interns across 1937 open-source projects.The results show that majority of the tasks involve both code-intensive tasks like adding new features and fixing bugs as well as non-code tasks like updating the documentation and restructuring the code base.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The feedback from reviewers covers code functionality and programming logic, testing coverage, error handling, code readability, and adopting best practices. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.654</span></span>Finally, we discuss the implications of these results for software engineering education.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have shown the potential to assist developers with coding and debugging tasks.However, their role in collaborative issue resolution is underexplored.In this study, we analyzed 1,152 Developer-ChatGPT conversations across 1,012 issues in GitHub to examine the diverse usage of ChatGPT and reliance on its generated code.Our contributions are fourfold.First, we manually analyzed 289 conversations to understand ChatGPT's usage in the GitHub Issues.Our analysis revealed that ChatGPT is primarily utilized for ideation, whereas its usage for validation (e.g., code documentation accuracy) is minimal.Second, we applied BERTopic modeling to identify key areas of engagement on the entire dataset.We found that backend issues (e.g., API management) dominate conversations, while testing is surprisingly less covered.Third, we utilized the CPD clone detection tool to check if the code generated by ChatGPT was used to address issues.Our findings revealed that ChatGPT-generated code was used as-is to resolve only 5.83\% of the issues.Fourth, we estimated sentiment using a RoBERTa-based sentiment analysis model to determine developers' satisfaction with different usages and engagement areas.We found positive sentiment (i.e., high satisfaction) about using ChatGPT for refactoring and addressing data analytics (e.g., categorizing table data) issues.On the contrary, we observed negative sentiment when using ChatGPT to debug issues and address automation tasks (e.g., GUI interactions).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings show the unmet needs and growing dissatisfaction among developers. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.634</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Researchers and ChatGPT developers should focus on developing task-specific solutions that help resolve diverse issues, improving user satisfaction and problem-solving efficiency in software development. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span></p>
