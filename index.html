                  <p>Advancements in computer-assisted surgical procedures heavily rely on accurate visual data interpretation from camera systems used during surgeries.Traditional open-access datasets focusing on surgical procedures are often limited by their small size, typically consisting of fewer than 100 videos with less than 100K images.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address these constraints, a new dataset called Surg-3M has been compiled using a novel aggregation pipeline that collects high-resolution videos from online sources. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.811</span></span>Featuring an extensive collection of over 4K surgical videos and more than 3 million high-quality images from multiple procedure types, Surg-3M offers a comprehensive resource surpassing existing alternatives in size and scope, including two novel tasks.To demonstrate the effectiveness of this dataset, we present SurgFM, a self-supervised foundation model pretrained on Surg-3M that achieves impressive results in downstream tasks such as surgical phase recognition, action recognition, and tool presence detection.Combining key components from ConvNeXt, DINO, and an innovative augmented distillation method, SurgFM exhibits exceptional performance compared to specialist architectures across various benchmarks.Our experimental results show that SurgFM outperforms state-of-the-art models in multiple downstream tasks, including significant gains in surgical phase recognition (+8.9pp, +4.7pp, and +3.9pp of Jaccard in AutoLaparo, M2CAI16, and Cholec80), action recognition (+3.1pp of mAP in CholecT50) and tool presence detection (+4.6pp of mAP in Cholec80).Moreover, even when using only half of the data, SurgFM outperforms state-of-the-art models in AutoLaparo and achieves state-of-the-art performance in Cholec80.Both Surg-3M and SurgFM have significant potential to accelerate progress towards developing autonomous robotic surgery systems.</p>

                  <p>Segmentation is a fundamental task in computer vision, with prompt-driven methods gaining prominence due to their flexibility.The recent Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated powerful point-prompt segmentation capabilities, while text-based segmentation models offer rich semantic understanding.However, existing approaches rarely explore how to effectively combine these complementary modalities for optimal segmentation performance.This paper presents BiPrompt-SAM, a novel dual-modal prompt segmentation framework that fuses the advantages of point and text prompts through an explicit selection mechanism.Specifically, we leverage SAM's inherent ability to generate multiple mask candidates, combined with a semantic guidance mask from text prompts, and explicitly select the most suitable candidate based on similarity metrics.This approach can be viewed as a simplified Mixture of Experts (MoE) system, where the point and text modules act as distinct "experts," and the similarity scoring serves as a rudimentary "gating network."<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conducted extensive evaluations on both the Endovis17 medical dataset and RefCOCO series natural image datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.822</span></span>On Endovis17, BiPrompt-SAM achieved 89.55\% mDice and 81.46\% mIoU, comparable to state-of-the-art specialized medical segmentation models.On the RefCOCO series datasets, our method attained 87.1\%, 86.5\%, and 85.8\% IoU, significantly outperforming existing approaches.Experiments demonstrate that our explicit dual-selection method effectively combines the spatial precision of point prompts with the semantic richness of text prompts, particularly excelling in scenarios involving semantically complex objects, multiple similar objects, and partial occlusions.BiPrompt-SAM not only provides a simple yet effective implementation but also offers a new perspective on multi-modal prompt fusion.</p>

                  <p>Text encoders in diffusion models have rapidly evolved, transitioning from CLIP to T5-XXL.Although this evolution has significantly enhanced the models' ability to understand complex prompts and generate text, it also leads to a substantial increase in the number of parameters.Despite T5 series encoders being trained on the C4 natural language corpus, which includes a significant amount of non-visual data, diffusion models with T5 encoder do not respond to those non-visual prompts, indicating redundancy in representational power.Therefore, it raises an important question: "Do we really need such a large text encoder?"In pursuit of an answer, we employ vision-based knowledge distillation to train a series of T5 encoder models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To fully inherit its capabilities, we constructed our dataset based on three criteria: image quality, semantic understanding, and text-rendering. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.711</span></span>Our results demonstrate the scaling down pattern that the distilled T5-base model can generate images of comparable quality to those produced by T5-XXL, while being 50 times smaller in size.This reduction in model size significantly lowers the GPU requirements for running state-of-the-art models such as FLUX and SD3, making high-quality text-to-image generation more accessible.</p>

                  <p>Predicting future video frames is essential for decision-making systems, yet RGB frames alone often lack the information needed to fully capture the underlying complexities of the real world.To address this limitation, we propose a multi-modal framework for Synchronous Video Prediction (SyncVP) that incorporates complementary data modalities, enhancing the richness and accuracy of future predictions.SyncVP builds on pre-trained modality-specific diffusion models and introduces an efficient spatio-temporal cross-attention module to enable effective information sharing across modalities.We evaluate SyncVP on standard benchmark datasets, such as Cityscapes and BAIR, using depth as an additional modality.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We furthermore demonstrate its generalization to other modalities on SYNTHIA with semantic information and ERA5-Land with climate data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.709</span></span>Notably, SyncVP achieves state-of-the-art performance, even in scenarios where only one modality is present, demonstrating its robustness and potential for a wide range of applications.</p>

                  <p>Repository-level code completion aims to complete code based on the long contexts of the repository.Existing studies extract long contexts from the repository as inputs and leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate code.However, we reveal a severe limitation of LLMs, i.e., LLMs may ignore the information within long contexts in code completion.In other words, even the contexts contain useful information (e.g., relevant APIs or similar code), LLMs may fail to utilize this information.We think this limitation is caused by an inherent bias in LLMs, i.e., relying on nearby contexts and ignoring long-range contexts.To address this, we propose a novel fine-tuning approach named CoLT.The core idea of CoLT is to provide explicit supervision signals, which emphasize that long-range contexts may hold relevant information.Specifically, CoLT proposes a reinforcement learning-based training, which explicitly encourages models to utilize the information within long contexts and punishes models for ignoring long contexts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To support CoLT, we release CoLT-132K, a large-scale dataset with 132k samples across four languages, each containing long-context inputs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.932</span></span>We apply CoLT to a popular LLM - aiXcoder-7B and release aiXcoder-7B-v2.We conduct extensive experiments on CoLT-132K and a public benchmark - CrossCodeEval.Our experiments yield the results: 1.Effectiveness.CoLT substantially improves aiXcoder-7B. aiXcoder-7B-v2 outperforms aiXcoder-7B by up to 44% in exact match.aiXcoder-7B-v2 becomes the state-of-the-art 7B model in code completion and even surpasses larger models.2. Generalizability.The capability learned by CoLT can generalize to new languages.Besides, CoLT is model-agnostic and effectively improves multiple LLMs.3. Enhanced Context Utilization Capability.CoLT significantly improves the capability of LLMs in utilizing the relevant information within long contexts.</p>

                  <p>Autonomous driving has the potential to significantly enhance productivity and provide numerous societal benefits.Ensuring robustness in these safety-critical systems is essential, particularly when vehicles must navigate adverse weather conditions and sensor corruptions that may not have been encountered during training.Current methods often overlook uncertainties arising from adversarial conditions or distributional shifts, limiting their real-world applicability.We propose an efficient adaptation of an uncertainty estimation technique for 3D occupancy prediction.Our method dynamically calibrates model confidence using epistemic uncertainty estimates.Our evaluation under various camera corruption scenarios, such as fog or missing cameras, demonstrates that our approach effectively quantifies epistemic uncertainty by assigning higher uncertainty values to unseen data.We introduce region-specific corruptions to simulate defects affecting only a single camera and validate our findings through both scene-level and region-level assessments.Our results show superior performance in Out-of-Distribution (OoD) detection and confidence calibration compared to common baselines such as Deep Ensembles and MC-Dropout.Our approach consistently demonstrates reliable uncertainty measures, indicating its potential for enhancing the robustness of autonomous driving systems in real-world scenarios.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/ika-rwth-aachen/OCCUQ . <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.886</span></span></p>

                  <p>Segmentation is a fundamental task in computer vision, with prompt-driven methods gaining prominence due to their flexibility.The recent Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated powerful point-prompt segmentation capabilities, while text-based segmentation models offer rich semantic understanding.However, existing approaches rarely explore how to effectively combine these complementary modalities for optimal segmentation performance.This paper presents BiPrompt-SAM, a novel dual-modal prompt segmentation framework that fuses the advantages of point and text prompts through an explicit selection mechanism.Specifically, we leverage SAM's inherent ability to generate multiple mask candidates, combined with a semantic guidance mask from text prompts, and explicitly select the most suitable candidate based on similarity metrics.This approach can be viewed as a simplified Mixture of Experts (MoE) system, where the point and text modules act as distinct "experts," and the similarity scoring serves as a rudimentary "gating network."We conducted extensive evaluations on both the Endovis17 medical dataset and RefCOCO series natural image datasets.On Endovis17, BiPrompt-SAM achieved 89.55\% mDice and 81.46\% mIoU, comparable to state-of-the-art specialized medical segmentation models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>On the RefCOCO series datasets, our method attained 87.1\%, 86.5\%, and 85.8\% IoU, significantly outperforming existing approaches. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.682</span></span>Experiments demonstrate that our explicit dual-selection method effectively combines the spatial precision of point prompts with the semantic richness of text prompts, particularly excelling in scenarios involving semantically complex objects, multiple similar objects, and partial occlusions.BiPrompt-SAM not only provides a simple yet effective implementation but also offers a new perspective on multi-modal prompt fusion.</p>

                  <p>We address the problem of cluster identity estimation in a personalized federated learning (PFL) setting in which users aim to learn different personal models.The backbone of effective learning in such a setting is to cluster users into groups whose objectives are similar.A typical approach in the literature is to achieve this by training users' data on different proposed personal models and assign them to groups based on which model achieves the lowest value of the users' loss functions.This process is to be done iteratively until group identities converge.A key challenge in such a setting arises when users have noisy labeled data, which may produce misleading values of their loss functions, and hence lead to ineffective clustering.To overcome this challenge, we propose a label-agnostic data similarity-based clustering algorithm, coined RCC-PFL, with three main advantages: the cluster identity estimation procedure is independent from the training labels; it is a one-shot clustering algorithm performed prior to the training; and it requires fewer communication rounds and less computation compared to iterative-based clustering methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We validate our proposed algorithm using various models and datasets and show that it outperforms multiple baselines in terms of average accuracy and variance reduction. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.763</span></span></p>

                  <p>Fuzzing is a well-established technique for detecting bugs and vulnerabilities.With the surge of fuzzers and fuzzer platforms being developed such as AFL and OSSFuzz rises the necessity to benchmark these tools' performance.A common problem is that vulnerability benchmarks are based on bugs in old software releases.For this very reason, Magma introduced the notion of forward-porting to reintroduce vulnerable code in current software releases.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While their results are promising, the state-of-the-art lacks an update on the maintainability of this approach over time. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span>Indeed, adding the vulnerable code to a recent software version might either break its functionality or make the vulnerable code no longer reachable.We characterise the challenges with forward-porting by reassessing the portability of Magma's CVEs four years after its release and manually reintroducing the vulnerabilities in the current software versions.We find the straightforward process efficient for 17 of the 32 CVEs in our study.We further investigate why a trivial forward-porting process fails in the 15 other CVEs.This involves identifying the commits breaking the forward-porting process and reverting them in addition to the bug fix.While we manage to complete the process for nine of these CVEs, we provide an update on all 15 and explain the challenges we have been confronted with in this process.Thereby, we give the basis for future work towards a sustainable forward-ported fuzzing benchmark.</p>

                  <p>Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) is a complex task that aims to retrieve images based on a multimodal query.Typical training data consists of triplets containing a reference image, a textual description of desired modifications, and the target image, which are expensive and time-consuming to acquire.The scarcity of CIR datasets has led to zero-shot approaches utilizing synthetic triplets or leveraging vision-language models (VLMs) with ubiquitous web-crawled image-caption pairs.However, these methods have significant limitations: synthetic triplets suffer from limited scale, lack of diversity, and unnatural modification text, while image-caption pairs hinder joint embedding learning of the multimodal query due to the absence of triplet data.Moreover, existing approaches struggle with complex and nuanced modification texts that demand sophisticated fusion and understanding of vision and language modalities.We present CoLLM, a one-stop framework that effectively addresses these limitations.Our approach generates triplets on-the-fly from image-caption pairs, enabling supervised training without manual annotation.We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate joint embeddings of reference images and modification texts, facilitating deeper multimodal fusion.Additionally, we introduce Multi-Text CIR (MTCIR), a large-scale dataset comprising 3.4M samples, and refine existing CIR benchmarks (CIRR and Fashion-IQ) to enhance evaluation reliability.Experimental results demonstrate that CoLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple CIR benchmarks and settings.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>MTCIR yields competitive results, with up to 15% performance improvement. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.645</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our refined benchmarks provide more reliable evaluation metrics for CIR models, contributing to the advancement of this important field. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.687</span></span></p>

                  <p>The growing adoption of long-context Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced significant memory and computational challenges in autoregressive decoding due to the expanding Key-Value (KV) cache.KV cache quantization has emerged as a promising solution, with prior work showing that 4-bit or even 2-bit quantization can maintain model accuracy while reducing memory costs.However, despite these benefits, preliminary implementations for the low-bit KV cache struggle to deliver the expected speedup due to quantization and dequantization overheads and the lack of Tensor Cores utilization.In this work, we propose BitDecoding, a GPU-optimized framework that unlocks Tensor Cores for efficient decoding with low-bit KV cache.Efficiently leveraging Tensor Cores for low-bit KV cache is challenging due to the dynamic nature of KV cache generation at each decoding step.BitDecoding addresses these challenges with a Tensor Cores-Centric BitFusion Scheme that ensures data layout compatibility to enable high utilization of Tensor Cores.Additionally, BitDecoding incorporates a warp-efficient parallel decoding kernel and a fine-grained asynchronous pipeline, minimizing dequantization overhead and improving computational efficiency.Experiments show that BitDecoding achieves up to 7.5x speedup on RTX 4090, 4.8x on A100, and 8.9x on H100, compared to FP16 FlashDecoding-v2.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It also outperforms the state-of-the-art low-bit KV cache implementation (QServe) by up to 4.3x. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span>On LLaMA-3.1-8B with a 128K sequence length, BitDecoding reduces single-batch decoding latency by 3x, demonstrating its effectiveness in long-context generation scenarios.The code is available at https://github.com/DD-DuDa/BitDecoding.</p>

                  <p>UAV has been widely used in various fields.However, most of the existing object detectors used in drones are not end-to-end and require the design of various complex components and careful fine-tuning.Most of the existing end-to-end object detectors are designed for natural scenes.It is not ideal to apply them directly to UAV images.In order to solve the above challenges, we design an local-global information interaction DETR for UAVs, namely LGI-DETR.Cross-layer bidirectional low-level and high-level feature information enhancement, this fusion method is effective especially in the field of small objection detection.At the initial stage of encoder, we propose a local spatial enhancement module (LSE), which enhances the low-level rich local spatial information into the high-level feature, and reduces the loss of local information in the transmission process of high-level information.At the final stage of the encoder, we propose a novel global information injection module (GII) designed to integrate rich high-level global semantic representations with low-level feature maps.This hierarchical fusion mechanism effectively addresses the inherent limitations of local receptive fields by propagating contextual information across the feature hierarchy.Experimental results on two challenging UAV image object detection benchmarks, VisDrone2019 and UAVDT, show that our proposed model outperforms the SOTA model.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Compared to the baseline model, AP and AP50 improved by 1.9% and 2.4%, respectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.686</span></span></p>

                  <p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) remains a fundamental yet formidable task in the video understanding community, with promising applications in areas such as information forensics and public safety protection.Due to the rarity and diversity of anomalies, existing methods only use easily collected regular events to model the inherent normality of normal spatial-temporal patterns in an unsupervised manner.Previous studies have shown that existing unsupervised VAD models are incapable of label-independent data offsets (e.g., scene changes) in real-world scenarios and may fail to respond to light anomalies due to the overgeneralization of deep neural networks.Inspired by causality learning, we argue that there exist causal factors that can adequately generalize the prototypical patterns of regular events and present significant deviations when anomalous instances occur.In this regard, we propose Causal Representation Consistency Learning (CRCL) to implicitly mine potential scene-robust causal variable in unsupervised video normality learning.Specifically, building on the structural causal models, we propose scene-debiasing learning and causality-inspired normality learning to strip away entangled scene bias in deep representations and learn causal video normality, respectively.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on benchmarks validate the superiority of our method over conventional deep representation learning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span>Moreover, ablation studies and extension validation show that the CRCL can cope with label-independent biases in multi-scene settings and maintain stable performance with only limited training data available.</p>

                  <p>Gait recognition is emerging as a promising and innovative area within the field of computer vision, widely applied to remote person identification.Although existing gait recognition methods have achieved substantial success in controlled laboratory datasets, their performance often declines significantly when transitioning to wild datasets.We argue that the performance gap can be primarily attributed to the spatio-temporal distribution inconsistencies present in wild datasets, where subjects appear at varying angles, positions, and distances across the frames.To achieve accurate gait recognition in the wild, we propose a skeleton-guided silhouette alignment strategy, which uses prior knowledge of the skeletons to perform affine transformations on the corresponding silhouettes.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the impact of data alignment on gait recognition.We conducted extensive experiments across multiple datasets and network architectures, and the results demonstrate the significant advantages of our proposed alignment strategy.Specifically, on the challenging Gait3D dataset, our method achieved an average performance improvement of 7.9% across all evaluated networks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, our method achieves substantial improvements on cross-domain datasets, with accuracy improvements of up to 24.0%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.627</span></span></p>

                  <p>Whole Slide Images (WSIs) are high-resolution digital scans widely used in medical diagnostics.WSI classification is typically approached using Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), where the slide is partitioned into tiles treated as interconnected instances.While attention-based MIL methods aim to identify the most informative tiles, they often fail to fully exploit the spatial relationships among them, potentially overlooking intricate tissue structures crucial for accurate diagnosis.To address this limitation, we propose Probabilistic Spatial Attention MIL (PSA-MIL), a novel attention-based MIL framework that integrates spatial context into the attention mechanism through learnable distance-decayed priors, formulated within a probabilistic interpretation of self-attention as a posterior distribution.This formulation enables a dynamic inference of spatial relationships during training, eliminating the need for predefined assumptions often imposed by previous approaches.Additionally, we suggest a spatial pruning strategy for the posterior, effectively reducing self-attention's quadratic complexity.To further enhance spatial modeling, we introduce a diversity loss that encourages variation among attention heads, ensuring each captures distinct spatial representations.Together, PSA-MIL enables a more data-driven and adaptive integration of spatial context, moving beyond predefined constraints.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We achieve state-of-the-art performance across both contextual and non-contextual baselines, while significantly reducing computational costs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.609</span></span></p>

                  <p>The shortest Disjoint Path problem (SDPP) requires us to find pairwise vertex disjoint paths between   k designated pairs of terminal vertices such that the sum of the path lengths is minimum.The   focus here is on SDPP restricted to planar graphs where all terminals are arbitrarily partitioned   over two distinct faces with the additional restriction that each face is required to contain an odd   number of terminals.We call this problem the Odd two-face planar SDPP.It is shown that this   problem is solvable in randomized polynomial time and even in RNC.This is the first parallel (or   even polynomial time) solution for the problem.   Our algorithm combines ideas from the randomized solution for 2-SDPP by Bj\"orklund and   Huslfeldt with its parallelization by Datta and Jaiswal along with the deterministic algorithm for   One-face planar SDPP by Datta, Iyer, Kulkarni and Mukherjee.   The proof uses a combination of two involutions to reduce a system of linear equations modulo a   power of 2 to a system of triangular form that is, therefore, invertible.This, in turn, is proved by   showing that the matrix of the equations, can be interpreted as (the adjacency matrix of) a directed   acyclic graph (DAG).While our algorithm is primarily algebraic the proof remains combinatorial.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also give a parallel algorithm for the (A + B)-SDPP introduced by Hirai and Namba. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.627</span></span></p>

                  <p>In this paper, we propose Selection and Pooling with Large Language Models (SPILL), an intuitive and domain-adaptive method for intent clustering without fine-tuning.Existing embeddings-based clustering methods rely on a few labeled examples or unsupervised fine-tuning to optimize results for each new dataset, which makes them less generalizable to multiple datasets.Our goal is to make these existing embedders more generalizable to new domain datasets without further fine-tuning.Inspired by our theoretical derivation and simulation results on the effectiveness of sampling and pooling techniques, we view the clustering task as a small-scale selection problem.A good solution to this problem is associated with better clustering performance.Accordingly, we propose a two-stage approach:First, for each utterance (referred to as the seed), we derive its embedding using an existing embedder.Then, we apply a distance metric to select a pool of candidates close to the seed.Because the embedder is not optimized for new datasets, in the second stage, we use an LLM to further select utterances from these candidates that share the same intent as the seed.Finally, we pool these selected candidates with the seed to derive a refined embedding for the seed.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We found that our method generally outperforms directly using an embedder, and it achieves comparable results to other state-of-the-art studies, even those that use much larger models and require fine-tuning, showing its strength and efficiency. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.671</span></span>Our results indicate that our method enables existing embedders to be further improved without additional fine-tuning, making them more adaptable to new domain datasets.Additionally, viewing the clustering task as a small-scale selection problem gives the potential of using LLMs to customize clustering tasks according to the user's goals.</p>

                  <p>Background: Patient recruitment in clinical trials is hindered by complex eligibility criteria and labor-intensive chart reviews.Prior research using text-only models have struggled to address this problem in a reliable and scalable way due to (1) limited reasoning capabilities, (2) information loss from converting visual records to text, and (3) lack of a generic EHR integration to extract patient data.   Methods: We introduce a broadly applicable, integration-free, LLM-powered pipeline that automates patient-trial matching using unprocessed documents extracted from EHRs.Our approach leverages (1) the new reasoning-LLM paradigm, enabling the assessment of even the most complex criteria, (2) visual capabilities of latest LLMs to interpret medical records without lossy image-to-text conversions, and (3) multimodal embeddings for efficient medical record search.The pipeline was validated on the n2c2 2018 cohort selection dataset (288 diabetic patients) and a real-world dataset composed of 485 patients from 30 different sites matched against 36 diverse trials.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Results: On the n2c2 dataset, our method achieved a new state-of-the-art criterion-level accuracy of 93\%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.67</span></span>In real-world trials, the pipeline yielded an accuracy of 87\%, undermined by the difficulty to replicate human decision-making when medical records lack sufficient information.Nevertheless, users were able to review overall eligibility in under 9 minutes per patient on average, representing an 80\% improvement over traditional manual chart reviews.   Conclusion: This pipeline demonstrates robust performance in clinical trial patient matching without requiring custom integration with site systems or trial-specific tailoring, thereby enabling scalable deployment across sites seeking to leverage AI for patient matching.</p>

                  <p>We consider the (offline) vertex-weighted Online Matching problem under Known Identical and Independent Distributions (KIID) with integral arrival rates.We propose a meta-algorithm, denoted as $\mathsf{RTB}$, featuring Real-Time Boosting, where the core idea is as follows.Consider a bipartite graph $G=(I,J,E)$, where $I$ and $J$ represent the sets of offline and online nodes, respectively.Let $\mathbf{x}=(x_{ij})\in[0,1]^{|E|}$, where $x_{ij}$ for $(i,j) \in E$ represents the probability that edge $(i,j)$ is matched in an offline optimal policy (a.k.a. a clairvoyant optimal policy), typically obtained by solving a benchmark linear program (LP).Upon the arrival of an online node $j$ at some time $t \in[0,1]$, $\mathsf{RTB}$ samples a safe (available) neighbor $i \in I_{j,t}$ with probability $x_{ij}/\sum_{i' \in I_{j,t}} x_{i'j}$ and matches it to $j$, where $I_{j,t}$ denotes the set of safe offline neighbors of $j$.   In this paper, we showcase the power of Real-Time Boosting by demonstrating that $\mathsf{RTB}$, when fed with $\mathbf{X}^*$, achieves a competitive ratio of $(2e^4 - 8e^2 + 21e - 27) /(2e^4) \approx 0.7341$, where $\mathbf{X}^* \in \{0,1/3,2/3\}^{|E|}$ is a random vector obtained by applying a customized dependent rounding technique due to Brubach et al.(Algorithmica, 2020).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our result improves upon the state-of-the-art ratios of 0.7299 by Brubach et al. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.632</span></span>(Algorithmica, 2020) and 0.725 by Jaillet and Lu (Mathematics of Operations Research, 2013).Notably, this improvement does not stem from the algorithm itself but from a new competitive analysis methodology: We introduce an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) system-based approach that enables a {holistic} analysis of $\mathsf{RTB}$.

                  <p>Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) are proving to be a powerful paradigm in unifying task modeling across diverse data domains, offering key advantages such as memory efficiency and resolution independence.Conventional deep learning models are typically modality-dependent, often requiring custom architectures and objectives for different types of signals.However, existing INR frameworks frequently rely on global latent vectors or exhibit computational inefficiencies that limit their broader applicability.We introduce LIFT, a novel, high-performance framework that addresses these challenges by capturing multiscale information through meta-learning.LIFT leverages multiple parallel localized implicit functions alongside a hierarchical latent generator to produce unified latent representations that span local, intermediate, and global features.This architecture facilitates smooth transitions across local regions, enhancing expressivity while maintaining inference efficiency.Additionally, we introduce ReLIFT, an enhanced variant of LIFT that incorporates residual connections and expressive frequency encodings.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>With this straightforward approach, ReLIFT effectively addresses the convergence-capacity gap found in comparable methods, providing an efficient yet powerful solution to improve capacity and speed up convergence. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.624</span></span>Empirical results show that LIFT achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in generative modeling and classification tasks, with notable reductions in computational costs.Moreover, in single-task settings, the streamlined ReLIFT architecture proves effective in signal representations and inverse problem tasks.</p>

                  <p>Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have noticeably advanced photo-realistic novel view synthesis using images from densely spaced camera viewpoints.However, these methods struggle in few-shot scenarios due to limited supervision.In this paper, we present NexusGS, a 3DGS-based approach that enhances novel view synthesis from sparse-view images by directly embedding depth information into point clouds, without relying on complex manual regularizations.Exploiting the inherent epipolar geometry of 3DGS, our method introduces a novel point cloud densification strategy that initializes 3DGS with a dense point cloud, reducing randomness in point placement while preventing over-smoothing and overfitting.Specifically, NexusGS comprises three key steps: Epipolar Depth Nexus, Flow-Resilient Depth Blending, and Flow-Filtered Depth Pruning.These steps leverage optical flow and camera poses to compute accurate depth maps, while mitigating the inaccuracies often associated with optical flow.By incorporating epipolar depth priors, NexusGS ensures reliable dense point cloud coverage and supports stable 3DGS training under sparse-view conditions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments demonstrate that NexusGS <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span>significantly enhances depth accuracy and rendering quality, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by a considerable margin.Furthermore, we validate the superiority of our generated point clouds by substantially boosting the performance of competing methods.Project page: https://usmizuki.github.io/NexusGS/.</p>

                  <p>Generative AI is radically changing the creative arts, by fundamentally transforming the way we create and interact with cultural artefacts.While offering unprecedented opportunities for artistic expression and commercialisation, this technology also raises ethical, societal, and legal concerns.Key among these are the potential displacement of human creativity, copyright infringement stemming from vast training datasets, and the lack of transparency, explainability, and fairness mechanisms.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>As generative systems become pervasive in this domain, responsible design is crucial. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.608</span></span>Whilst previous work has tackled isolated aspects of generative systems (e.g., transparency, evaluation, data), we take a comprehensive approach, grounding these efforts within the Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence produced by the High-Level Expert Group on AI appointed by the European Commission - a framework for designing responsible AI systems across seven macro requirements.Focusing on generative music AI, we illustrate how these requirements can be contextualised for the field, addressing trustworthiness across multiple dimensions and integrating insights from the existing literature.We further propose a roadmap for operationalising these contextualised requirements, emphasising interdisciplinary collaboration and stakeholder engagement.Our work provides a foundation for designing and evaluating responsible music generation systems, calling for collaboration among AI experts, ethicists, legal scholars, and artists.This manuscript is accompanied by a website: https://amresearchlab.github.io/raim-framework/.</p>

                  <p>Researchers must ensure that the claims about the knowledge produced by their work are valid.However, validity is neither well-understood nor consistently established in design science, which involves the development and evaluation of artifacts (models, methods, instantiations, and theories) to solve problems.As a result, it is challenging to demonstrate and communicate the validity of knowledge claims about artifacts.This paper defines validity in design science and derives the Design Science Validity Framework and a process model for applying it.The framework comprises three high-level claim and validity types-criterion, causal, and context-as well as validity subtypes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The framework guides researchers in integrating validity considerations into projects employing design science and contributes to the growing body of research on design science methodology. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.61</span></span>It also provides a systematic way to articulate and validate the knowledge claims of design science projects.We apply the framework to examples from existing research and then use it to demonstrate the validity of knowledge claims about the framework itself.</p>

We present a systematic literature review (SLR) featuring 119 papers concerning the automation of code review tasks.We provide: (i) a categorization of the code review tasks automated in the literature; (ii) an overview of the under-the-hood techniques used for the automation, including the datasets used for training data-driven techniques; (iii) publicly available techniques and datasets used for their evaluation, with a description of the evaluation metrics usually adopted for each task.   The SLR is concluded by a discussion of the current limitations of the state-of-the-art, with insights for future research directions.</p>
