                  <p>Robust and realistic rendering for large-scale road scenes is essential in autonomous driving simulation.Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has made groundbreaking progress in neural rendering, but the general fidelity of large-scale road scene renderings is often limited by the input imagery, which usually has a narrow field of view and focuses mainly on the street-level local area.Intuitively, the data from the drone's perspective can provide a complementary viewpoint for the data from the ground vehicle's perspective, enhancing the completeness of scene reconstruction and rendering.However, training naively with aerial and ground images, which exhibit large view disparity, poses a significant convergence challenge for 3D-GS, and does not demonstrate remarkable improvements in performance on road views.In order to enhance the novel view synthesis of road views and to effectively use the aerial information, we design an uncertainty-aware training method that allows aerial images to assist in the synthesis of areas where ground images have poor learning outcomes instead of weighting all pixels equally in 3D-GS training like prior work did.We are the first to introduce the cross-view uncertainty to 3D-GS by matching the car-view ensemble-based rendering uncertainty to aerial images, weighting the contribution of each pixel to the training process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, to systematically quantify evaluation metrics, we assemble a high-quality synthesized dataset comprising both aerial and ground images for road scenes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.749</span></span></p>

                  <p>Multimodal foundation models serve numerous applications at the intersection of vision and language.Still, despite being pretrained on extensive data, they become outdated over time.To keep models updated, research into continual pretraining mainly explores scenarios with either (1) infrequent, indiscriminate updates on large-scale new data, or (2) frequent, sample-level updates.However, practical model deployment often operates in the gap between these two limit cases, as real-world applications often demand adaptation to specific subdomains, tasks or concepts -- spread over the entire, varying life cycle of a model.In this work, we complement current perspectives on continual pretraining through a research test bed as well as provide comprehensive guidance for effective continual model updates in such scenarios.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We first introduce FoMo-in-Flux, a continual multimodal pretraining benchmark with realistic compute constraints and practical deployment requirements, constructed over 63 datasets with diverse visual and semantic coverage. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.775</span></span>Using FoMo-in-Flux, we explore the complex landscape of practical continual pretraining through multiple perspectives: (1) A data-centric investigation of data mixtures and stream orderings that emulate real-world deployment situations, (2) a method-centric investigation ranging from simple fine-tuning and traditional continual learning strategies to parameter-efficient updates and model merging, (3) meta learning rate schedules and mechanistic design choices, and (4) the influence of model and compute scaling.Together, our insights provide a practitioner's guide to continual multimodal pretraining for real-world deployment.Our benchmark and code is here: https://github.com/ExplainableML/fomo_in_flux.</p>

                  <p>Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs)-based recommender systems have encountered great success in recommendation.As the number of GNNs approaches rises, some works have started questioning the theoretical and empirical reasons behind their superior performance.Nevertheless, this investigation still disregards that GNNs treat the recommendation data as a topological graph structure.Building on this assumption, in this work, we provide a novel evaluation perspective on GNNs-based recommendation, which investigates the impact of the graph topology on the recommendation performance.To this end, we select some (topological) properties of the recommendation data and three GNNs-based recommender systems (i.e., LightGCN, DGCF, and SVD-GCN).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Then, starting from three popular recommendation datasets (i.e., Yelp2018, Gowalla, and Amazon-Book) we sample them to obtain 1,800 size-reduced datasets that still resemble the original ones but can encompass a wider range of topological structures. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.757</span></span>We use this procedure to build a large pool of samples for which data characteristics and recommendation performance of the selected GNNs models are measured.Through an explanatory framework, we find strong correspondences between graph topology and GNNs performance, offering a novel evaluation perspective on these models.</p>

                  <p>Cops and Robber is a well-studied two-player pursuit-evasion game played on a graph, where a group of cops tries to capture the robber.The \emph{cop number} of a graph is the minimum number of cops required to capture the robber.Gaven\v{c}iak et al.~[Eur.J. of Comb. 72, 45--69 (2018)] studied the game on intersection graphs and established that the cop number for the class of string graphs is at most 15, and asked as an open question to improve this bound for string graphs and subclasses of string graphs.We address this question and establish that the cop number of a string graph is at most 13.To this end, we develop a novel \textit{guarding} technique.We further establish that this technique can be useful for other Cops and Robber games on graphs admitting a representation.In particular, we show that four cops have a winning strategy for a variant of Cops and Robber, named Fully Active Cops and Robber, on planar graphs, addressing an open question of Gromovikov et al.~[Austr.J.

                  <p>The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has significantly advanced code completion capabilities, giving rise to a new generation of LLM-based Code Completion Tools (LCCTs).Unlike general-purpose LLMs, these tools possess unique workflows, integrating multiple information sources as input and prioritizing code suggestions over natural language interaction, which introduces distinct security challenges.Additionally, LCCTs often rely on proprietary code datasets for training, raising concerns about the potential exposure of sensitive data.This paper exploits these distinct characteristics of LCCTs to develop targeted attack methodologies on two critical security risks: jailbreaking and training data extraction attacks.Our experimental results expose significant vulnerabilities within LCCTs, including a 99.4% success rate in jailbreaking attacks on GitHub Copilot and a 46.3% success rate on Amazon Q.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, We successfully extracted sensitive user data from GitHub Copilot, including 54 real email addresses and 314 physical addresses associated with GitHub usernames. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.799</span></span>Our study also demonstrates that these code-based attack methods are effective against general-purpose LLMs, such as the GPT series, highlighting a broader security misalignment in the handling of code by modern LLMs.These findings underscore critical security challenges associated with LCCTs and suggest essential directions for strengthening their security frameworks.The example code and attack samples from our research are provided at https://github.com/Sensente/Security-Attacks-on-LCCTs.</p>

                  <p>People with Parkinson's Disease (PD) often experience progressively worsening gait, including changes in how they turn around, as the disease progresses.Existing clinical rating tools are not capable of capturing hour-by-hour variations of PD symptoms, as they are confined to brief assessments within clinic settings.Measuring real-world gait turning angles continuously and passively is a component step towards using gait characteristics as sensitive indicators of disease progression in PD.This paper presents a deep learning-based approach to automatically quantify turning angles by extracting 3D skeletons from videos and calculating the rotation of hip and knee joints.We utilise state-of-the-art human pose estimation models, Fastpose and Strided Transformer, on a total of 1386 turning video clips from 24 subjects (12 people with PD and 12 healthy control volunteers), trimmed from a PD dataset of unscripted free-living videos in a home-like setting (Turn-REMAP).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also curate a turning video dataset, Turn-H3.6M, from the public Human3.6M human pose benchmark with 3D ground truth, to further validate our method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.778</span></span>Previous gait research has primarily taken place in clinics or laboratories evaluating scripted gait outcomes, but this work focuses on real-world settings where complexities exist, such as baggy clothing and poor lighting.Due to difficulties in obtaining accurate ground truth data in a free-living setting, we quantise the angle into the nearest bin $45^\circ$ based on the manual labelling of expert clinicians.Our method achieves a turning calculation accuracy of 41.6%, a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 34.7{\deg}, and a weighted precision WPrec of 68.3% for Turn-REMAP.This is the first work to explore the use of single monocular camera data to quantify turns by PD patients in a home setting.</p>

                  <p>Facial wrinkle detection plays a crucial role in cosmetic dermatology.Precise manual segmentation of facial wrinkles is challenging and time-consuming, with inherent subjectivity leading to inconsistent results among graders.To address this issue, we propose two solutions.First, we build and release the first public facial wrinkle dataset, `FFHQ-Wrinkle', an extension of the NVIDIA FFHQ dataset.This dataset includes 1,000 images with human labels and 50,000 images with automatically generated weak labels.This dataset can foster the research community to develop advanced wrinkle detection algorithms.Second, we introduce a training strategy for U-Net-like encoder-decoder models to detect wrinkles across the face automatically.Our method employs a two-stage training strategy: texture map pretraining and finetuning on human-labeled data.Initially, we pretrain models on a large dataset with weak labels (N=50k) or masked texture maps generated through computer vision techniques, without human intervention.Subsequently, we finetune the models using human-labeled data (N=1k), which consists of manually labeled wrinkle masks.During finetuning, the network inputs a combination of RGB and masked texture maps, comprising four channels.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We effectively combine labels from multiple annotators to minimize subjectivity in manual labeling. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.661</span></span>Our strategies demonstrate improved segmentation performance in facial wrinkle segmentation both quantitatively and visually compared to existing pretraining methods.</p>

                  <p>Clinical machine learning research and AI driven clinical decision support models rely on clinically accurate labels.Manually extracting these labels with the help of clinical specialists is often time-consuming and expensive.This study tests the feasibility of automatic span- and document-level diagnosis extraction from unstructured Dutch echocardiogram reports.   We included 115,692 unstructured echocardiogram reports from the UMCU a large university hospital in the Netherlands.A randomly selected subset was manually annotated for the occurrence and severity of eleven commonly described cardiac characteristics.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We developed and tested several automatic labelling techniques at both span and document levels, using weighted and macro F1-score, precision, and recall for performance evaluation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.645</span></span>We compared the performance of span labelling against document labelling methods, which included both direct document classifiers and indirect document classifiers that rely on span classification results.   The SpanCategorizer and MedRoBERTa.nl models outperformed all other span and document classifiers, respectively.The weighted F1-score varied between characteristics, ranging from 0.60 to 0.93 in SpanCategorizer and 0.96 to 0.98 in MedRoBERTa.nl.Direct document classification was superior to indirect document classification using span classifiers.SetFit achieved competitive document classification performance using only 10\% of the training data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Utilizing a reduced label set yielded near-perfect document classification results.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.632</span></span>We recommend using our published SpanCategorizer and MedRoBERTa.nl models for span- and document-level diagnosis extraction from Dutch echocardiography reports.For settings with limited training data, SetFit may be a promising alternative for document classification.</p>

In this work, we focus on leveraging the properties of semantic graphs to enhance HGNN performance.First, we analyze the Semantic Graph Build (SGB) stage and identify significant opportunities for data reuse during semantic graph generation.Next, we uncover the phenomenon of buffer thrashing during the Graph Feature Processing (GFP) stage, revealing potential optimization opportunities in semantic graph layout.Furthermore, we propose a lightweight hardware accelerator frontend for HGNNs, called SiHGNN.This accelerator frontend incorporates a tree-based Semantic Graph Builder for efficient semantic graph generation and features a novel Graph Restructurer for optimizing semantic graph layouts.Experimental results show that SiHGNN enables the state-of-the-art HGNN accelerator to achieve an average performance improvement of 2.95$\times$.</p>

                  <p>Methane (CH_4) is a potent anthropogenic greenhouse gas, contributing 86 times more to global warming than Carbon Dioxide (CO_2) over 20 years, and it also acts as an air pollutant.Given its high radiative forcing potential and relatively short atmospheric lifetime (9\textpm1 years), methane has important implications for climate change, therefore, cutting methane emissions is crucial for effective climate change mitigation.This work expands existing information on operational methane point source detection sensors in the Short-Wave Infrared (SWIR) bands.It reviews the state-of-the-art for traditional as well as Machine Learning (ML) approaches.The architecture and data used in such ML models will be discussed separately for methane plume segmentation and emission rate estimation.Traditionally, experts rely on labor-intensive manually adjusted methods for methane detection.However, ML approaches offer greater scalability.Our analysis reveals that ML models outperform traditional methods, particularly those based on convolutional neural networks (CNN), which are based on the U-net and transformer architectures.These ML models extract valuable information from methane-sensitive spectral data, enabling a more accurate detection.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Challenges arise when comparing these methods due to variations in data, sensor specifications, and evaluation metrics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span>To address this, we discuss existing datasets and metrics, providing an overview of available resources and identifying open research problems.Finally, we explore potential future advances in ML, emphasizing approaches for model comparability, large dataset creation, and the European Union's forthcoming methane strategy.</p>

                  <p>In this paper, we investigate a variant of the classical stochastic Multi-armed Bandit (MAB) problem, where the payoff received by an agent (either cost or reward) is both delayed, and directly corresponds to the magnitude of the delay.This setting models faithfully many real world scenarios such as the time it takes for a data packet to traverse a network given a choice of route (where delay serves as the agent's cost); or a user's time spent on a web page given a choice of content (where delay serves as the agent's reward).   Our main contributions are tight upper and lower bounds for both the cost and reward settings.For the case that delays serve as costs, which we are the first to consider, we prove optimal regret that scales as $\sum_{i:\Delta_i > 0}\frac{\logT}{\Delta_i} + d^*$, where $T$ is the maximal number of steps, $\Delta_i$ are the sub-optimality gaps and $d^*$ is the minimal expected delay amongst arms.For the case that delays serves as rewards, we show optimal regret of $\sum_{i:\Delta_i > 0}\frac{\log T}{\Delta_i} + \bar{d}$, where $\bar d$ is the second maximal expected delay.These improve over the regret in the general delay-dependent payoff setting, which scales as $\sum_{i:\Delta_i > 0}\frac{\log T}{\Delta_i} + D$, where $D$ is the maximum possible delay.Our regret bounds highlight the difference between the cost and reward scenarios, showing that the improvement in the cost scenario is more significant than for the reward.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we accompany our theoretical results with an empirical evaluation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span></p>

                  <p>Promptable segmentation typically requires instance-specific manual prompts to guide the segmentation of each desired object.To minimize such a need, task-generic promptable segmentation has been introduced, which employs a single task-generic prompt to segment various images of different objects in the same task.Current methods use Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to reason detailed instance-specific prompts from a task-generic prompt for improving segmentation accuracy.The effectiveness of this segmentation heavily depends on the precision of these derived prompts.However, MLLMs often suffer hallucinations during reasoning, resulting in inaccurate prompting.While existing methods focus on eliminating hallucinations to improve a model, we argue that MLLM hallucinations can reveal valuable contextual insights when leveraged correctly, as they represent pre-trained large-scale knowledge beyond individual images.In this paper, we utilize hallucinations to mine task-related information from images and verify its accuracy for enhancing precision of the generated prompts.Specifically, we introduce an iterative Prompt-Mask Cycle generation framework (ProMaC) with a prompt generator and a mask generator.The prompt generator uses a multi-scale chain of thought prompting, initially exploring hallucinations for extracting extended contextual knowledge on a test image.These hallucinations are then reduced to formulate precise instance-specific prompts, directing the mask generator to produce masks that are consistent with task semantics by mask semantic alignment.The generated masks iteratively induce the prompt generator to focus more on task-relevant image areas and reduce irrelevant hallucinations, resulting jointly in better prompts and masks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments on 5 benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of ProMaC.

                  <p>The Polytope Scheduling Problem (PSP) was introduced by Im, Kulkarni, and Munagala (JACM 2018) as a very general abstraction of resource allocation over time and captures many well-studied problems including classical unrelated machine scheduling, multidimensional scheduling, and broadcast scheduling.In PSP, jobs with different arrival times receive processing rates that are subject to arbitrary packing constraints.An elegant and well-known algorithm for instantaneous rate allocation with good fairness and efficiency properties is the Proportional Fairness algorithm (PF), which was analyzed for PSP by Im et al.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We drastically improve the analysis of the PF algorithm for both the general PSP and several of its important special cases subject to the objective of minimizing the sum of weighted completion times. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span>We reduce the upper bound on the competitive ratio from 128 to 27 for general PSP and to 4 for the prominent class of monotone PSP.For certain heterogeneous machine environments we even close the substantial gap to the lower bound of 2 for non-clairvoyant scheduling.Our analysis also gives the first polynomial-time improvements over the nearly 30-year-old bounds on the competitive ratio of the doubling framework by Hall, Shmoys, and Wein (SODA 1996) for clairvoyant online preemptive scheduling on unrelated machines.Somewhat surprisingly, we achieve this improvement by a non-clairvoyant algorithm, thereby demonstrating that non-clairvoyance is not a (significant) hurdle.   Our improvements are based on exploiting monotonicity properties of PSP, providing tight dual fitting arguments on structured instances, and showing new additivity properties on the optimal objective value for scheduling on unrelated machines.Finally, we establish new connections of PF to matching markets, and thereby provide new insights on equilibria and their computational complexity.</p>

                  <p>Data augmentation is widely used for training a neural network given little labeled data.A common practice of augmentation training is applying a composition of multiple transformations sequentially to the data.Existing augmentation methods such as RandAugment randomly sample from a list of pre-selected transformations, while methods such as AutoAugment apply advanced search to optimize over an augmentation set of size $k^d$, which is the number of transformation sequences of length $d$, given a list of $k$ transformations.   In this paper, we design efficient algorithms whose running time complexity is much faster than the worst-case complexity of $O(k^d)$, provably.We propose a new algorithm to search for a binary tree-structured composition of $k$ transformations, where each tree node corresponds to one transformation.The binary tree generalizes sequential augmentations, such as the SimCLR augmentation scheme for contrastive learning.Using a top-down, recursive search procedure, our algorithm achieves a runtime complexity of $O(2^d k)$, which is much faster than $O(k^d)$ as $k$ increases above $2$. We apply our algorithm to tackle data distributions with heterogeneous subpopulations by searching for one tree in each subpopulation and then learning a weighted combination, resulting in a forest of trees.   We validate our proposed algorithms on numerous graph and image datasets, including a multi-label graph classification dataset we collected.The dataset exhibits significant variations in the sizes of graphs and their average degrees, making it ideal for studying data augmentation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We show that our approach can reduce the computation cost by 43% over existing search methods while improving performance by 4.3%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span>The tree structures can be used to interpret the relative importance of each transformation, such as identifying the important transformations on small vs. large graphs.</p>

                  <p>The rapid advancement of visual generative models necessitates efficient and reliable evaluation methods.Arena platform, which gathers user votes on model comparisons, can rank models with human preferences.However, traditional Arena methods, while established, require an excessive number of comparisons for ranking to converge and are vulnerable to preference noise in voting, suggesting the need for better approaches tailored to contemporary evaluation challenges.In this paper, we introduce K-Sort Arena, an efficient and reliable platform based on a key insight: images and videos possess higher perceptual intuitiveness than texts, enabling rapid evaluation of multiple samples simultaneously.Consequently, K-Sort Arena employs K-wise comparisons, allowing K models to engage in free-for-all competitions, which yield much richer information than pairwise comparisons.To enhance the robustness of the system, we leverage probabilistic modeling and Bayesian updating techniques.We propose an exploration-exploitation-based matchmaking strategy to facilitate more informative comparisons.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In our experiments, K-Sort Arena exhibits 16.3x faster convergence compared to the widely used ELO algorithm. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.627</span></span>To further validate the superiority and obtain a comprehensive leaderboard, we collect human feedback via crowdsourced evaluations of numerous cutting-edge text-to-image and text-to-video models.Thanks to its high efficiency, K-Sort Arena can continuously incorporate emerging models and update the leaderboard with minimal votes.Our project has undergone several months of internal testing and is now available at https://huggingface.co/spaces/ksort/K-Sort-Arena</p>

                  <p>Dataset Distillation (DD) aims to synthesize a small dataset capable of performing comparably to the original dataset.Despite the success of numerous DD methods, theoretical exploration of this area remains unaddressed.In this paper, we take an initial step towards understanding various matching-based DD methods from the perspective of sample difficulty.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We begin by empirically examining sample difficulty, measured by gradient norm, and observe that different matching-based methods roughly correspond to specific difficulty tendencies. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.634</span></span>We then extend the neural scaling laws of data pruning to DD to theoretically explain these matching-based methods.Our findings suggest that prioritizing the synthesis of easier samples from the original dataset can enhance the quality of distilled datasets, especially in low IPC (image-per-class) settings.Based on our empirical observations and theoretical analysis, we introduce the Sample Difficulty Correction (SDC) approach, designed to predominantly generate easier samples to achieve higher dataset quality.Our SDC can be seamlessly integrated into existing methods as a plugin with minimal code adjustments.Experimental results demonstrate that adding SDC generates higher-quality distilled datasets across 7 distillation methods and 6 datasets.</p>

Following this framework, we make progress on numerous problems:   1) Online Stochastic Matching: We improve the state-of-the-art $0.666$ competitive ratio for unweighted/vertex-weighted matching to $0.69$.   2) Query-Commit Matching: We enhance the ratio to $0.705$ in the Query-Commit model, improving the best previous $0.696$ and $0.662$ for unweighted and vertex-weighted matching.   3) Stochastic AdWords: We give a $0.6338$ competitive algorithm, breaking the $1-\frac{1}{e}$ barrier and answering a decade-old open question.   4) AdWords: The framework applies to the adversarial model if the rounding is oblivious to future items' distributions.We get the first multi-way OCS for AdWords, addressing an open question about OCS.This gives a $0.504$ competitive ratio for AdWords, improving the previous $0.501$.   5) Stochastic Display Ads: We design a $0.644$ competitive algorithm, breaking the $1-\frac{1}{e}$ barrier.</p>

                  <p>Anomaly detection is critical in surveillance systems and patrol robots by identifying anomalous regions in images for early warning.Depending on whether reference data are utilized, anomaly detection can be categorized into anomaly detection with reference and anomaly detection without reference.Currently, anomaly detection without reference, which is closely related to out-of-distribution (OoD) object detection, struggles with learning anomalous patterns due to the difficulty of collecting sufficiently large and diverse anomaly datasets with the inherent rarity and novelty of anomalies.Alternatively, anomaly detection with reference employs the scheme of change detection to identify anomalies by comparing semantic changes between a reference image and a query one.However, there are very few ADr works due to the scarcity of public datasets in this domain.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we aim to address this gap by introducing the UMAD Benchmark Dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>To our best knowledge, this is the first benchmark dataset designed specifically for anomaly detection with reference in robotic patrolling scenarios, e.g., where an autonomous robot is employed to detect anomalous objects by comparing a reference and a query video sequences.The reference sequences can be taken by the robot along a specified route when there are no anomalous objects in the scene.The query sequences are captured online by the robot when it is patrolling in the same scene following the same route.Our benchmark dataset is elaborated such that each query image can find a corresponding reference based on accurate robot localization along the same route in the prebuilt 3D map, with which the reference and query images can be geometrically aligned using adaptive warping.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Besides the proposed benchmark dataset, we evaluate the baseline models of ADr on this dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.63</span></span></p>

                  <p>Background: Data quality is vital in software analytics, particularly for machine learning (ML) applications like software defect prediction (SDP).Despite the widespread use of ML in software engineering, the effect of data quality antipatterns on these models remains underexplored.   Objective: This study develops a taxonomy of ML-specific data quality antipatterns and assesses their impact on software analytics models' performance and interpretation.   Methods: We identified eight types and 14 sub-types of ML-specific data quality antipatterns through a literature review.We conducted experiments to determine the prevalence of these antipatterns in SDP data (RQ1), assess how cleaning order affects model performance (RQ2), evaluate the impact of antipattern removal on performance (RQ3), and examine the consistency of interpretation from models built with different antipatterns (RQ4).   Results:In our SDP case study, we identified nine antipatterns.Over 90% of these overlapped at both row and column levels, complicating cleaning prioritization and risking excessive data removal.The order of cleaning significantly impacts ML model performance, with neural networks being more resilient to cleaning order changes than simpler models like logistic regression.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Antipatterns such as Tailed Distributions and Class Overlap show a statistically significant correlation with performance metrics when other antipatterns are cleaned. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span>Models built with different antipatterns showed moderate consistency in interpretation results.   Conclusion: The cleaning order of different antipatterns impacts ML model performance.Five antipatterns have a statistically significant correlation with model performance when others are cleaned.Additionally, model interpretation is moderately affected by different data quality antipatterns.</p>

                  <p>Neural implicit reconstruction via volume rendering has demonstrated its effectiveness in recovering dense 3D surfaces.However, it is non-trivial to simultaneously recover meticulous geometry and preserve smoothness across regions with differing characteristics.To address this issue, previous methods typically employ geometric priors, which are often constrained by the performance of the prior models.In this paper, we propose ND-SDF, which learns a Normal Ddeflection field to represent the angular deviation between the scene normal and the prior normal.Unlike previous methods that uniformly apply geometric priors on all samples, introducing significant bias in accuracy, our proposed normal deflection field dynamically learns and adapts the utilization of samples based on their specific characteristics, thereby improving both the accuracy and effectiveness of the model.Our method not only obtains smooth weakly textured regions such as walls and floors but also preserves the geometric details of complex structures.In addition, we introduce a novel ray sampling strategy based on the deflection angle to facilitate the unbiased rendering process, which significantly improves the quality and accuracy of intricate surfaces, especially on thin structures.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Consistent improvements on various challenging datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.649</span></span></p>

                  <p>The ICP registration algorithm has been a preferred method for LiDAR-based robot localization for nearly a decade.However, even in modern SLAM solutions, ICP can degrade and become unreliable in geometrically ill-conditioned environments.Current solutions primarily focus on utilizing additional sources of information, such as external odometry, to either replace the degenerate directions of the optimization solution or add additional constraints in a sensor-fusion setup afterward.In response, this work investigates and compares new and existing degeneracy mitigation methods for robust LiDAR-based localization and analyzes the efficacy of these approaches in degenerate environments for the first time in the literature at this scale.Specifically, this work proposes and investigates i) the incorporation of different types of constraints into the ICP algorithm, ii) the effect of using active or passive degeneracy mitigation techniques, and iii) the choice of utilizing global point cloud registration methods on the ill-conditioned ICP problem in LiDAR degenerate environments.The study results are validated through multiple real-world field and simulated experiments.The analysis shows that active optimization degeneracy mitigation is necessary and advantageous in the absence of reliable external estimate assistance for LiDAR-SLAM.Furthermore, introducing degeneracy-aware hard constraints in the optimization before or during the optimization is shown to perform better in the wild than by including the constraints after.Moreover, with heuristic fine-tuned parameters, soft constraints can provide equal or better results in complex ill-conditioned scenarios.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The implementations used in the analysis of this work are made publicly available to the community. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span></p>

                  <p>Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) have expanded graph representation learning to heterogeneous graph fields.Recent studies have demonstrated their superior performance across various applications, including medical analysis and recommendation systems, often surpassing existing methods.However, GPUs often experience inefficiencies when executing HGNNs due to their unique and complex execution patterns.Compared to traditional Graph Neural Networks, these patterns further exacerbate irregularities in memory access.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To tackle these challenges, recent studies have focused on developing domain-specific accelerators for HGNNs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span>Nonetheless, most of these efforts have concentrated on optimizing the datapath or scheduling data accesses, while largely overlooking the potential benefits that could be gained from leveraging the inherent properties of the semantic graph, such as its topology, layout, and generation.   In this work, we focus on leveraging the properties of semantic graphs to enhance HGNN performance.First, we analyze the Semantic Graph Build (SGB) stage and identify significant opportunities for data reuse during semantic graph generation.Next, we uncover the phenomenon of buffer thrashing during the Graph Feature Processing (GFP) stage, revealing potential optimization opportunities in semantic graph layout.Furthermore, we propose a lightweight hardware accelerator frontend for HGNNs, called SiHGNN.This accelerator frontend incorporates a tree-based Semantic Graph Builder for efficient semantic graph generation and features a novel Graph Restructurer for optimizing semantic graph layouts.Experimental results show that SiHGNN enables the state-of-the-art HGNN accelerator to achieve an average performance improvement of 2.95$\times$.</p>

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to early detection of performance regressions by bridging the local performance data generated by component-level testing and the system-level architectural models.Our approach uses local performance data to identify deviations at the component level, and then propagate these deviations to the architectural model.We then use the architectural model to predict regressions in the performance of the overall system.We evaluate our approach on two open-source benchmark systems and show that it can effectively detect end-to-end system performance regressions from local performance deviations with different intensities and under various system workloads.More importantly, our approach can detect regressions as early as in the development phase, in contrast to existing approaches that require the system to be fully built and deployed.Our approach is lightweight and can complement traditional system performance testing when testing resources are scarce.</p>

                  <p>The rise of machine learning (ML) and its embedding in systems has drastically changed the engineering of software-intensive systems.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Traditionally, software engineering focuses on manually created artifacts such as source code and the process of creating them, as well as best practices for integrating them, i.e., software architectures. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.647</span></span>In contrast, the development of ML artifacts, i.e. ML models, comes from data science and focuses on the ML models and their training data.However, to deliver value to end users, these ML models must be embedded in traditional software, often forming complex topologies.In fact, ML-enabled software can easily incorporate many different ML models.While the challenges and practices of building ML-enabled systems have been studied to some extent, beyond isolated examples, little is known about the characteristics of real-world ML-enabled systems.Properly embedding ML models in systems so that they can be easily maintained or reused is far from trivial.We need to improve our empirical understanding of such systems, which we address by presenting the first large-scale study of real ML-enabled software systems, covering over 2,928 open source systems on GitHub.We classified and analyzed them to determine their characteristics, as well as their practices for reusing ML models and related code, and the architecture of these systems.Our findings provide practitioners and researchers with insight into practices for embedding and integrating ML models, bringing data science and software engineering closer together.</p>

                Towards Fixing Panic Bugs for Real-world Rust Programs

                  <p>The Rust programming language has garnered significant attention due to its robust safety features and memory management capabilities.Despite its guaranteed memory safety, Rust programs still suffer from runtime errors that are unmanageable, i.e., panic errors.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Notably, over half of the bugs in rustc, Rust's own compiler, are attributable to crash stemming from panic errors. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>However, understanding root causes and resolving these panics often requires substantial effort due to the limited information provided, and the stack backtrace could be intricate, often omitting the actual fault locations.Although numerous automated program repair techniques exist, we observe that the prevailing fix patterns do not readily apply to Rust programs due to natural differences in language mechanisms.To tackle the above challenges, this paper introduces a systematic study aimed at fixing Rust panic bugs.We commence by assembling a dataset, namely Panic4R, which includes 102 real panic bugs and their fixes from the top 500 most downloaded open-source crates.By analyzing Rust's implementation, we identify Rust-specific patterns for fixing panic bugs, which can aid in understanding and providing guidance for generating patches.Finally, we design and implement the first automated fixing tool, PanicKiller, for Rust panic bugs, which effectively generates correct patches on the real-world large-scale dataset, and has already assisted in the resolution of 28 panic bugs in open-source projects.Each resolved issue has been validated by the developers and merged into the respective codebases.</p>
