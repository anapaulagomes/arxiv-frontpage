                  <p>The rapid advancement of generative models in creating highly realistic images poses substantial risks for misinformation dissemination.For instance, a synthetic image, when shared on social media, can mislead extensive audiences and erode trust in digital content, resulting in severe repercussions.Despite some progress, academia has not yet created a large and diversified deepfake detection dataset for social media, nor has it devised an effective solution to address this issue.In this paper, we introduce the Social media Image Detection dataSet (SID-Set), which offers three key advantages: (1) extensive volume, featuring 300K AI-generated/tampered and authentic images with comprehensive annotations, (2) broad diversity, encompassing fully synthetic and tampered images across various classes, and (3) elevated realism, with images that are predominantly indistinguishable from genuine ones through mere visual inspection.Furthermore, leveraging the exceptional capabilities of large multimodal models, we propose a new image deepfake detection, localization, and explanation framework, named SIDA (Social media Image Detection, localization, and explanation Assistant).SIDA not only discerns the authenticity of images, but also delineates tampered regions through mask prediction and provides textual explanations of the model's judgment criteria.Compared with state-of-the-art deepfake detection models on SID-Set and other benchmarks, extensive experiments demonstrate that SIDA achieves superior performance among diversified settings.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code, model, and dataset will be released. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.862</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large models have achieved remarkable performance across various tasks, yet they incur significant computational costs and privacy concerns during both training and inference.Distributed deployment has emerged as a potential solution, but it necessitates the exchange of intermediate information between model segments, with feature representations serving as crucial information carriers.To optimize information exchange, feature coding methods are applied to reduce transmission and storage overhead.Despite its importance, feature coding for large models remains an under-explored area.In this paper, we draw attention to large model feature coding and make three contributions to this field.First, we introduce a comprehensive dataset encompassing diverse features generated by three representative types of large models.Second, we establish unified test conditions, enabling standardized evaluation pipelines and fair comparisons across future feature coding studies.Third, we introduce two baseline methods derived from widely used image coding techniques and benchmark their performance on the proposed dataset.These contributions aim to advance the field of feature coding, facilitating more efficient large model deployment.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>All source code and the dataset will be made available on GitHub. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.922</span></span></p>

                  <p>Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP have been cherished for their ability to perform zero-shot visual recognition on open-vocabulary concepts.This is achieved by selecting the object category whose textual representation bears the highest similarity with the query image.While successful in some domains, this method struggles with identifying fine-grained entities as well as generalizing to unseen concepts that are not captured by the training distribution.Recent works attempt to mitigate these challenges by integrating category descriptions at test time, albeit yielding modest improvements.We attribute these limited gains to a fundamental misalignment between image and description representations, which is rooted in the pretraining structure of CLIP.In this paper, we propose GRAIN, a new pretraining strategy aimed at aligning representations at both fine and coarse levels simultaneously.Our approach learns to jointly ground textual descriptions in image regions along with aligning overarching captions with global image representations.To drive this pre-training, we leverage frozen Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to derive large-scale synthetic annotations.We demonstrate the enhanced zero-shot performance of our model compared to current state-of-the art methods across 11 diverse image classification datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, we introduce Products-2023, a newly curated, manually labeled dataset featuring novel concepts, and showcase our model's ability to recognize these concepts by benchmarking on it. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.745</span></span>Significant improvements achieved by our model on other downstream tasks like retrieval further highlight the superior quality of representations learned by our approach.Code available at https://github.com/shaunak27/grain-clip .</p>

Overall, this dataset and baseline model provide strong evidence that we are moving towards models which can effectively Cubify Anything.</p>

                  <p>Circular-arc graphs are the intersection graphs of arcs of a circle.The main result of this work describes the structure of all \emph{normalized intersection models} of circular-arc graphs.Normalized models of a circular-arc graph reflect the neighborhood relation between its vertices and can be seen as its canonical representations; in particular, any intersection model can be made normalized by possibly extending some of its arcs.We~devise a data-structure, called \emph{PQM-tree}, that maintains the set of all normalized models of a circular-arc graph.We show that the PQM-tree of a circular-arc graph can be computed in linear time.Finally, basing on PQM-trees, we provide a linear-time algorithm for the canonization and the isomorphism problem for circular-arc graphs.   We describe the structure of the normalized models of circular-arc graphs using an approach proposed by Hsu~[\emph{SIAM J.

                  <p>While text-to-image models offer numerous benefits, they also pose significant societal risks.Detecting AI-generated images is crucial for mitigating these risks.Detection methods can be broadly categorized into passive and watermark-based approaches: passive detectors rely on artifacts present in AI-generated images, whereas watermark-based detectors proactively embed watermarks into such images.A key question is which type of detector performs better in terms of effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency.However, the current literature lacks a comprehensive understanding of this issue.In this work, we aim to bridge that gap by developing ImageDetectBench, the first comprehensive benchmark to compare the effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of passive and watermark-based detectors.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our benchmark includes four datasets, each containing a mix of AI-generated and non-AI-generated images. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.773</span></span>We evaluate five passive detectors and four watermark-based detectors against eight types of common perturbations and three types of adversarial perturbations.Our benchmark results reveal several interesting findings.For instance, watermark-based detectors consistently outperform passive detectors, both in the presence and absence of perturbations.Based on these insights, we provide recommendations for detecting AI-generated images, e.g., when both types of detectors are applicable, watermark-based detectors should be the preferred choice.</p>

                  <p>Bayesian optimization is efficient even with a small amount of data and is used in engineering and in science, including biology and chemistry.In Bayesian optimization, a parameterized model with an uncertainty is fitted to explain the experimental data, and then the model suggests parameters that would most likely improve the results.Batch Bayesian optimization reduces the processing time of optimization by parallelizing experiments.However, batch Bayesian optimization cannot be applied if the number of parallelized experiments is limited by the cost or scarcity of equipment; in such cases, sequential methods require an unrealistic amount of time.In this study, we developed pipelining Bayesian optimization (PipeBO) to reduce the processing time of optimization even with a limited number of parallel experiments.PipeBO was inspired by the pipelining of central processing unit architecture, which divides computational tasks into multiple processes.PipeBO was designed to achieve experiment parallelization by overlapping various processes of the experiments.PipeBO uses the results of completed experiments to update the parameters of running parallelized experiments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Using the Black-Box Optimization Benchmarking, which consists of 24 benchmark functions, we compared PipeBO with the sequential Bayesian optimization methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span>PipeBO reduced the average processing time of optimization to about 56% for the experiments that consisted of two processes or even less for those with more processes for 20 out of the 24 functions.Overall, PipeBO parallelizes Bayesian optimization in the resource-constrained settings so that efficient optimization can be achieved.</p>

                  <p>Recently, large vision-language models (LVLMs) have rapidly gained popularity for their strong generation and reasoning capabilities given diverse multimodal inputs.However, these models incur significant computational and memory overhead during inference, which greatly hinders the efficient deployment in practical scenarios.The extensive key-value (KV) cache, necessitated by the lengthy input and output sequences, notably contributes to the high inference cost.Based on this, recent works have investigated ways to reduce the KV cache size for higher efficiency.Although effective, they generally overlook the distinct importance distributions of KV vectors across layers and maintain the same cache size for each layer during the next token prediction.This results in the significant contextual information loss for certain layers, leading to notable performance decline.To address this, we present PrefixKV.It reframes the challenge of determining KV cache sizes for all layers into the task of searching for the optimal global prefix configuration.With an adaptive layer-wise KV retention recipe based on binary search, the maximum contextual information can thus be preserved in each layer, facilitating the generation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance compared with others. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.723</span></span>It exhibits superior inference efficiency and generation quality trade-offs, showing promising potential for practical applications.Code is available at \url{https://github.com/THU-MIG/PrefixKV}.</p>

                  <p>Path Planning methods for autonomously controlling swarms of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are gaining momentum due to their operational advantages.An increasing number of scenarios now require autonomous control of multiple UAVs, as autonomous operation can significantly reduce labor costs.Additionally, obtaining optimal flight paths can lower energy consumption, thereby extending battery life for other critical operations.Many of these scenarios, however, involve obstacles such as power lines and trees, which complicate Path Planning.This paper presents an evolutionary computation-based system employing genetic algorithms to address this problem in environments with obstacles.The proposed approach aims to ensure complete coverage of areas with fixed obstacles, such as in field exploration tasks, while minimizing flight time regardless of map size or the number of UAVs in the swarm.No specific goal points or prior information beyond the provided map is required.The experiments conducted in this study used five maps of varying sizes and obstacle densities, as well as a control map without obstacles, with different numbers of UAVs.The results demonstrate that this method can determine optimal paths for all UAVs during full map traversal, thus minimizing resource consumption.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A comparative analysis with other state-of-the-art approach is presented to highlight the advantages and potential limitations of the proposed method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.729</span></span></p>

                  <p>Representation learning aims to extract meaningful lower-dimensional embeddings from data, known as representations.Despite its widespread application, there is no established definition of a ``good'' representation.Typically, the representation quality is evaluated based on its performance in downstream tasks such as clustering, de-noising, etc.However, this task-specific approach has a limitation where a representation that performs well for one task may not necessarily be effective for another.This highlights the need for a more agnostic formulation, which is the focus of our work.We propose a downstream-agnostic formulation: when inherent clusters exist in the data, the representations should be specific to each cluster.Under this idea, we develop a meta-algorithm that jointly learns cluster-specific representations and cluster assignments.As our approach is easy to integrate with any representation learning framework, we demonstrate its effectiveness in various setups, including Autoencoders, Variational Autoencoders, Contrastive learning models, and Restricted Boltzmann Machines.We qualitatively compare our cluster-specific embeddings to standard embeddings and downstream tasks such as de-noising and clustering.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While our method slightly increases runtime and parameters compared to the standard model, the experiments clearly show that it extracts the inherent cluster structures in the data, resulting in improved performance in relevant applications. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.64</span></span></p>

                  <p>Multimodal language models (MLMs) still face challenges in fundamental visual perception tasks where specialized models excel.Tasks requiring reasoning about 3D structures benefit from depth estimation, and reasoning about 2D object instances benefits from object detection.Yet, MLMs can not produce intermediate depth or boxes to reason over.Finetuning MLMs on relevant data doesn't generalize well and outsourcing computation to specialized vision tools is too compute-intensive and memory-inefficient.To address this, we introduce Perception Tokens, intrinsic image representations designed to assist reasoning tasks where language is insufficient.Perception tokens act as auxiliary reasoning tokens, akin to chain-of-thought prompts in language models.For example, in a depth-related task, an MLM augmented with perception tokens can reason by generating a depth map as tokens, enabling it to solve the problem effectively.We propose AURORA, a training method that augments MLMs with perception tokens for improved reasoning over visual inputs.AURORA leverages a VQVAE to transform intermediate image representations, such as depth maps into a tokenized format and bounding box tokens, which is then used in a multi-task training framework.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>AURORA achieves notable improvements across counting benchmarks: +10.8% on BLINK, +11.3% on CVBench, and +8.3% on SEED-Bench, outperforming finetuning approaches in generalization across datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.624</span></span>It also improves on relative depth: over +6% on BLINK.With perception tokens, AURORA expands the scope of MLMs beyond language-based reasoning, paving the way for more effective visual reasoning capabilities.</p>

                  <p>Robust Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is a crucial enabler for autonomous navigation in natural, unstructured environments such as parks and gardens.However, these environments present unique challenges for SLAM due to frequent seasonal changes, varying light conditions, and dense vegetation.These factors often degrade the performance of visual SLAM algorithms originally developed for structured urban environments.To address this gap, we present ROVER, a comprehensive benchmark dataset tailored for evaluating visual SLAM algorithms under diverse environmental conditions and spatial configurations.We captured the dataset with a robotic platform equipped with monocular, stereo, and RGB-D cameras, as well as inertial sensors.It covers 39 recordings across five outdoor locations, collected through all seasons and various lighting scenarios, i.e., day, dusk, and night with and without external lighting.With this novel dataset, we evaluate several traditional and deep learning-based SLAM methods and study their performance in diverse challenging conditions.The results demonstrate that while stereo-inertial and RGB-D configurations generally perform better under favorable lighting and moderate vegetation, most SLAM systems perform poorly in low-light and high-vegetation scenarios, particularly during summer and autumn.Our analysis highlights the need for improved adaptability in visual SLAM algorithms for outdoor applications, as current systems struggle with dynamic environmental factors affecting scale, feature extraction, and trajectory consistency.This dataset provides a solid foundation for advancing visual SLAM research in real-world, natural environments, fostering the development of more resilient SLAM systems for long-term outdoor localization and mapping.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset and the code of the benchmark are available under https://iis-esslingen.github.io/rover. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.665</span></span></p>

                  <p>Producing emotionally dynamic 3D facial avatars with text derived from spoken words (Emo3D) has been a pivotal research topic in 3D avatar generation.While progress has been made in general-purpose 3D avatar generation, the exploration of generating emotional 3D avatars remains scarce, primarily due to the complexities of identifying and rendering rich emotions from spoken words.This paper reexamines Emo3D generation and draws inspiration from human processes, breaking down Emo3D into two cascading steps: Text-to-3D Expression Mapping (T3DEM) and 3D Avatar Rendering (3DAR).T3DEM is the most crucial step in determining the quality of Emo3D generation and encompasses three key challenges: Expression Diversity, Emotion-Content Consistency, and Expression Fluidity.To address these challenges, we introduce a novel benchmark to advance research in Emo3D generation.First, we present EmoAva, a large-scale, high-quality dataset for T3DEM, comprising 15,000 text-to-3D expression mappings that characterize the aforementioned three challenges in Emo3D generation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we develop various metrics to effectively evaluate models against these identified challenges. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.61</span></span>Next, to effectively model the consistency, diversity, and fluidity of human expressions in the T3DEM step, we propose the Continuous Text-to-Expression Generator, which employs an autoregressive Conditional Variational Autoencoder for expression code generation, enhanced with Latent Temporal Attention and Expression-wise Attention mechanisms.Finally, to further enhance the 3DAR step on rendering higher-quality subtle expressions, we present the Globally-informed Gaussian Avatar (GiGA) model.GiGA incorporates a global information mechanism into 3D Gaussian representations, enabling the capture of subtle micro-expressions and seamless transitions between emotional states.</p>

                  <p>Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs), such as GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Reka Core, have expanded their capabilities to include vision and audio modalities.While these models demonstrate impressive performance across a wide range of audio-visual applications, our proposed DeafTest reveals that MLLMs often struggle with simple tasks humans find trivial: 1) determining which of two sounds is louder, and 2) determining which of two sounds has a higher pitch.Motivated by these observations, we introduce AV-Odyssey Bench, a comprehensive audio-visual benchmark designed to assess whether those MLLMs can truly understand the audio-visual information.This benchmark encompasses 4,555 carefully crafted problems, each incorporating text, visual, and audio components.To successfully infer answers, models must effectively leverage clues from both visual and audio inputs.To ensure precise and objective evaluation of MLLM responses, we have structured the questions as multiple-choice, eliminating the need for human evaluation or LLM-assisted assessment.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We benchmark a series of closed-source and open-source models and summarize the observations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.668</span></span>By revealing the limitations of current models, we aim to provide useful insight for future dataset collection and model development.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically trained to predict in the forward direction of time.However, recent works have shown that prompting these models to look back and critique their own generations can produce useful feedback.Motivated by this, we explore the question of whether LLMs can be empowered to think (predict and score) backwards to provide unsupervised feedback that complements forward LLMs.Towards this, we introduce Time Reversed Language Models (TRLMs), which can score and generate queries when conditioned on responses, effectively functioning in the reverse direction of time.Further, to effectively infer in the response to query direction, we pre-train and fine-tune a language model (TRLM-Ba) in the reverse token order from scratch.We show empirically (and theoretically in a stylized setting) that time-reversed models can indeed complement forward model predictions when used to score the query given response for re-ranking multiple forward generations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We obtain up to 5\% improvement on the widely used AlpacaEval Leaderboard over the competent baseline of best-of-N re-ranking using self log-perplexity scores. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.624</span></span>We further show that TRLM scoring outperforms conventional forward scoring of response given query, resulting in significant gains in applications such as citation generation and passage retrieval.We next leverage the generative ability of TRLM to augment or provide unsupervised feedback to input safety filters of LLMs, demonstrating a drastic reduction in false negative rate with negligible impact on false positive rates against several attacks published on the popular JailbreakBench leaderboard.</p>

                  <p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has been crucial in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values.Traditionally, RLHF involves generating responses to a query and using a reward model to assign a reward to the entire response.However, this approach faces challenges due to its reliance on a single, sparse reward, which makes it challenging for the model to identify which parts of the sequence contribute most significantly to the final reward.Recent methods have attempted to address this limitation by introducing token-level rewards.However, these methods often rely on either a trained credit assignment model or AI annotators, raising concerns about the quality and reliability of the rewards.In this paper, we propose token-level reward regularization (T-REG), a novel approach that leverages both sequence-level and token-level rewards for preference optimization.Harnessing the self-refinement capabilities of LLMs, our method uses contrastive prompting to enable LLMs to self-generate token-level rewards.These self-generated rewards then act as reward regularization, guiding the model to more effectively distribute sequence-level rewards across tokens.This facilitates better token-level credit assignment and enhances alignment performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments on the instruction following benchmarks, including Alpaca Eval 2 and Arena-Hard, show that our method consistently outperforms baseline methods by up to 3.8% and 4.4%, respectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.712</span></span>We will release the code and models at https://github.com/wzhouad/T-REG.</p>

                  <p>Advancing towards generalist agents necessitates the concurrent processing of multiple tasks using a unified model, thereby underscoring the growing significance of simultaneous model training on multiple downstream tasks.A common issue in multi-task learning is the occurrence of gradient conflict, which leads to potential competition among different tasks during joint training.This competition often results in improvements in one task at the expense of deterioration in another.Although several optimization methods have been developed to address this issue by manipulating task gradients for better task balancing, they cannot decrease the incidence of gradient conflict.In this paper, we systematically investigate the occurrence of gradient conflict across different methods and propose a strategy to reduce such conflicts through sparse training (ST), wherein only a portion of the model's parameters are updated during training while keeping the rest unchanged.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our extensive experiments demonstrate that ST effectively mitigates conflicting gradients and leads to superior performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>Furthermore, ST can be easily integrated with gradient manipulation techniques, thus enhancing their effectiveness.</p>

                  <p>In the 21st-century information age, with the development of big data technology, effectively extracting valuable information from massive data has become a key issue.Traditional data mining methods are inadequate when faced with large-scale, high-dimensional and complex data.Especially when labeled data is scarce, their performance is greatly limited.This study optimizes data mining algorithms by introducing semi-supervised learning methods, aiming to improve the algorithm's ability to utilize unlabeled data, thereby achieving more accurate data analysis and pattern recognition under limited labeled data conditions.Specifically, we adopt a self-training method and combine it with a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image feature extraction and classification, and continuously improve the model prediction performance through an iterative process.The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms traditional machine learning techniques such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), XGBoost, and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) on the CIFAR-10 image classification dataset.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Notable improvements were observed in key performance metrics, including accuracy, recall, and F1 score. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.645</span></span>Furthermore, the robustness and noise-resistance capabilities of the semi-supervised CNN model were validated through experiments under varying noise levels, confirming its practical applicability in real-world scenarios.</p>

                  <p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction and rendering technique due to its high-quality results and fast training and rendering time.However, pixels covered by the same Gaussian are always shaded in the same color up to a Gaussian falloff scaling factor.Furthermore, the finest geometric detail any individual Gaussian can represent is a simple ellipsoid.These properties of 3DGS greatly limit the expressivity of individual Gaussian primitives.To address these issues, we draw inspiration from texture and alpha mapping in traditional graphics and integrate it with 3DGS.Specifically, we propose a new generalized Gaussian appearance representation that augments each Gaussian with alpha~(A), RGB, or RGBA texture maps to model spatially varying color and opacity across the extent of each Gaussian.As such, each Gaussian can represent a richer set of texture patterns and geometric structures, instead of just a single color and ellipsoid as in naive Gaussian Splatting.Surprisingly, we found that the expressivity of Gaussians can be greatly improved by using alpha-only texture maps, and further augmenting Gaussians with RGB texture maps achieves the highest expressivity.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We validate our method on a wide variety of standard benchmark datasets and our own custom captures at both the object and scene levels. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We demonstrate image quality improvements over existing methods while using a similar or lower number of Gaussians. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span></p>

                  <p>We present Liquid, an auto-regressive generation paradigm that seamlessly integrates visual comprehension and generation by tokenizing images into discrete codes and learning these code embeddings alongside text tokens within a shared feature space for both vision and language.Unlike previous multimodal large language model (MLLM), Liquid achieves this integration using a single large language model (LLM), eliminating the need for external pretrained visual embeddings such as CLIP.For the first time, Liquid uncovers a scaling law that performance drop unavoidably brought by the unified training of visual and language tasks diminishes as the model size increases.Furthermore, the unified token space enables visual generation and comprehension tasks to mutually enhance each other, effectively removing the typical interference seen in earlier models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We show that existing LLMs can serve as strong foundations for Liquid, saving 100x in training costs while outperforming Chameleon in multimodal capabilities and maintaining language performance comparable to mainstream LLMs like LLAMA2. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.763</span></span>Liquid also outperforms models like SD v2.1 and SD-XL (FID of 5.47 on MJHQ-30K), excelling in both vision-language and text-only tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This work demonstrates that LLMs such as LLAMA3.2 and GEMMA2 are powerful multimodal generators, offering a scalable solution for enhancing both vision-language understanding and generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.698</span></span>The code and models will be released.</p>

                  <p>Multimodal language models (MLMs) still face challenges in fundamental visual perception tasks where specialized models excel.Tasks requiring reasoning about 3D structures benefit from depth estimation, and reasoning about 2D object instances benefits from object detection.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Yet, MLMs can not produce intermediate depth or boxes to reason over. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.638</span></span>Finetuning MLMs on relevant data doesn't generalize well and outsourcing computation to specialized vision tools is too compute-intensive and memory-inefficient.To address this, we introduce Perception Tokens, intrinsic image representations designed to assist reasoning tasks where language is insufficient.Perception tokens act as auxiliary reasoning tokens, akin to chain-of-thought prompts in language models.For example, in a depth-related task, an MLM augmented with perception tokens can reason by generating a depth map as tokens, enabling it to solve the problem effectively.We propose AURORA, a training method that augments MLMs with perception tokens for improved reasoning over visual inputs.AURORA leverages a VQVAE to transform intermediate image representations, such as depth maps into a tokenized format and bounding box tokens, which is then used in a multi-task training framework.AURORA achieves notable improvements across counting benchmarks: +10.8% on BLINK, +11.3% on CVBench, and +8.3% on SEED-Bench, outperforming finetuning approaches in generalization across datasets.It also improves on relative depth: over +6% on BLINK.With perception tokens, AURORA expands the scope of MLMs beyond language-based reasoning, paving the way for more effective visual reasoning capabilities.</p>

                  <p>We present Argos, a simple approach for adding verifiability to fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) schemes using trusted hardware.Traditional approaches to verifiable FHE require expensive cryptographic proofs, which incur an overhead of up to seven orders of magnitude on top of FHE, making them impractical.   With Argos, we show that trusted hardware can be securely used to provide verifiability for FHE computations, with minimal overhead relative to the baseline FHE computation.An important contribution of Argos is showing that the major security pitfall associated with trusted hardware, microarchitectural side channels, can be completely mitigated by excluding any secrets from the CPU and the memory hierarchy.This is made possible by focusing on building a platform that only enforces program and data integrity and not confidentiality (which is sufficient for verifiable FHE, since all data remain encrypted at all times).All secrets related to the attestation mechanism are kept in a separate coprocessor (e.g., a TPM) inaccessible to any software-based attacker.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Relying on a discrete TPM typically incurs significant performance overhead, which is why (insecure) software-based TPMs are used in practice. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.622</span></span>As a second contribution, we show that for FHE applications, the attestation protocol can be adapted to only incur a fixed cost.   Argos requires no dedicated hardware extensions and is supported on commodity processors from 2008 onward.Our prototype implementation introduces 6% overhead to the FHE evaluation, and 8% for more complex protocols.In particular, we show that Argos can be adapted for real-world applications of FHE, such as PIR and PSI.By demonstrating how to combine cryptography with trusted hardware, Argos paves the way for widespread deployment of FHE-based protocols beyond the semi-honest setting, without the overhead of cryptographic proofs.</p>

                  <p>Compute-in-memory (CiM)-based binary neural network (CiM-BNN) accelerators marry the benefits of CiM and ultra-low precision quantization, making them highly suitable for edge computing.However, CiM-enabled crossbar (Xbar) arrays are plagued with hardware non-idealities like parasitic resistances and device non-linearities that impair inference accuracy, especially in scaled technologies.In this work, we first analyze the impact of Xbar non-idealities on the inference accuracy of various CiM-BNNs, establishing that the unique properties of CiM-BNNs make them more prone to hardware non-idealities compared to higher precision deep neural networks (DNNs).To address this issue, we propose BinSparX, a training-free technique that mitigates non-idealities in CiM-BNNs.BinSparX utilizes the distinct attributes of BNNs to reduce the average current generated during the CiM operations in Xbar arrays.This is achieved by statically and dynamically sparsifying the BNN weights and activations, respectively (which, in the context of BNNs, is defined as reducing the number of +1 weights and activations).This minimizes the IR drops across the parasitic resistances, drastically mitigating their impact on inference accuracy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To evaluate our technique, we conduct experiments on ResNet-18 and VGG-small CiM-BNNs designed at the 7nm technology node using 8T-SRAM and 1T-1ReRAM. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span>Our results show that BinSparX is highly effective in alleviating the impact of non-idealities, recouping the inference accuracy to near-ideal (software) levels in some cases and providing accuracy boost of up to 77.25%.These benefits are accompanied by energy reduction, albeit at the cost of mild latency/area increase.</p>

                  <p>The rise of Foundation Models (FMs) like Large Language Models (LLMs) is revolutionizing software development.Despite the impressive prototypes, transforming FMware into production-ready products demands complex engineering across various domains.A critical but overlooked aspect is performance engineering, which aims at ensuring FMware meets performance goals such as throughput and latency to avoid user dissatisfaction and financial loss.Often, performance considerations are an afterthought, leading to costly optimization efforts post-deployment.FMware's high computational resource demands highlight the need for efficient hardware use.Continuous performance engineering is essential to prevent degradation.This paper highlights the significance of Software Performance Engineering (SPE) in FMware, identifying four key challenges: cognitive architecture design, communication protocols, tuning and optimization, and deployment.These challenges are based on literature surveys and experiences from developing an in-house FMware system.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We discuss problems, current practices, and innovative paths for the software engineering community. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.659</span></span></p>
