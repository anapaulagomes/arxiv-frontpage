                  <p>Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs)-based recommender systems have encountered great success in recommendation.As the number of GNNs approaches rises, some works have started questioning the theoretical and empirical reasons behind their superior performance.Nevertheless, this investigation still disregards that GNNs treat the recommendation data as a topological graph structure.Building on this assumption, in this work, we provide a novel evaluation perspective on GNNs-based recommendation, which investigates the impact of the graph topology on the recommendation performance.To this end, we select some (topological) properties of the recommendation data and three GNNs-based recommender systems (i.e., LightGCN, DGCF, and SVD-GCN).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Then, starting from three popular recommendation datasets (i.e., Yelp2018, Gowalla, and Amazon-Book) we sample them to obtain 1,800 size-reduced datasets that still resemble the original ones but can encompass a wider range of topological structures. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.757</span></span>We use this procedure to build a large pool of samples for which data characteristics and recommendation performance of the selected GNNs models are measured.Through an explanatory framework, we find strong correspondences between graph topology and GNNs performance, offering a novel evaluation perspective on these models.</p>

                  <p>The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized role-playing, enabling the development of general role-playing models.However, current role-playing training has two significant issues: (I) Using a predefined role profile to prompt dialogue training for specific scenarios usually leads to inconsistencies and even conflicts between the dialogue and the profile, resulting in training biases.(II)The model learns to imitate the role based solely on the profile, neglecting profile-dialogue alignment at the sentence level.In this work, we propose a simple yet effective framework called BEYOND DIALOGUE, designed to overcome these hurdles.This framework innovatively introduces "beyond dialogue" tasks to align dialogue with profile traits based on each specific scenario, thereby eliminating biases during training.Furthermore, by adopting an innovative prompting mechanism that generates reasoning outcomes for training, the framework allows the model to achieve fine-grained alignment between profile and dialogue at the sentence level.The aforementioned methods are fully automated and low-cost.Additionally, the integration of automated dialogue and objective evaluation methods forms a comprehensive framework, paving the way for general role-playing.Experimental results demonstrate that our model excels in adhering to and reflecting various dimensions of role profiles, outperforming most proprietary general and specialized role-playing baselines.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>All code and datasets are available at https://github.com/yuyouyu32/BeyondDialogue. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.796</span></span></p>

                  <p>The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has significantly advanced code completion capabilities, giving rise to a new generation of LLM-based Code Completion Tools (LCCTs).Unlike general-purpose LLMs, these tools possess unique workflows, integrating multiple information sources as input and prioritizing code suggestions over natural language interaction, which introduces distinct security challenges.Additionally, LCCTs often rely on proprietary code datasets for training, raising concerns about the potential exposure of sensitive data.This paper exploits these distinct characteristics of LCCTs to develop targeted attack methodologies on two critical security risks: jailbreaking and training data extraction attacks.Our experimental results expose significant vulnerabilities within LCCTs, including a 99.4% success rate in jailbreaking attacks on GitHub Copilot and a 46.3% success rate on Amazon Q.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, We successfully extracted sensitive user data from GitHub Copilot, including 54 real email addresses and 314 physical addresses associated with GitHub usernames. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.799</span></span>Our study also demonstrates that these code-based attack methods are effective against general-purpose LLMs, such as the GPT series, highlighting a broader security misalignment in the handling of code by modern LLMs.These findings underscore critical security challenges associated with LCCTs and suggest essential directions for strengthening their security frameworks.The example code and attack samples from our research are provided at https://github.com/Sensente/Security-Attacks-on-LCCTs.</p>

                  <p>Financial time series modeling is crucial for understanding and predicting market behaviors but faces challenges such as non-linearity, non-stationarity, and high noise levels.Traditional models struggle to capture complex patterns due to these issues, compounded by limitations in computational resources and model capacity.Inspired by the success of large language models in NLP, we introduce \textbf{PLUTUS}, a \textbf{P}re-trained \textbf{L}arge \textbf{U}nified \textbf{T}ransformer-based model that \textbf{U}nveils regularities in financial time \textbf{S}eries.PLUTUS uses an invertible embedding module with contrastive learning and autoencoder techniques to create an approximate one-to-one mapping between raw data and patch embeddings.TimeFormer, an attention based architecture, forms the core of PLUTUS, effectively modeling high-noise time series.We incorporate a novel attention mechanisms to capture features across both variable and temporal dimensions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>PLUTUS is pre-trained on an unprecedented dataset of 100 billion observations, designed to thrive in noisy financial environments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.765</span></span>To our knowledge, PLUTUS is the first open-source, large-scale, pre-trained financial time series model with over one billion parameters.It achieves state-of-the-art performance in various tasks, demonstrating strong transferability and establishing a robust foundational model for finance.Our research provides technical guidance for pre-training financial time series data, setting a new standard in the field.</p>

                  <p>People with Parkinson's Disease (PD) often experience progressively worsening gait, including changes in how they turn around, as the disease progresses.Existing clinical rating tools are not capable of capturing hour-by-hour variations of PD symptoms, as they are confined to brief assessments within clinic settings.Measuring real-world gait turning angles continuously and passively is a component step towards using gait characteristics as sensitive indicators of disease progression in PD.This paper presents a deep learning-based approach to automatically quantify turning angles by extracting 3D skeletons from videos and calculating the rotation of hip and knee joints.We utilise state-of-the-art human pose estimation models, Fastpose and Strided Transformer, on a total of 1386 turning video clips from 24 subjects (12 people with PD and 12 healthy control volunteers), trimmed from a PD dataset of unscripted free-living videos in a home-like setting (Turn-REMAP).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also curate a turning video dataset, Turn-H3.6M, from the public Human3.6M human pose benchmark with 3D ground truth, to further validate our method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.778</span></span>Previous gait research has primarily taken place in clinics or laboratories evaluating scripted gait outcomes, but this work focuses on real-world settings where complexities exist, such as baggy clothing and poor lighting.Due to difficulties in obtaining accurate ground truth data in a free-living setting, we quantise the angle into the nearest bin $45^\circ$ based on the manual labelling of expert clinicians.Our method achieves a turning calculation accuracy of 41.6%, a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 34.7{\deg}, and a weighted precision WPrec of 68.3% for Turn-REMAP.This is the first work to explore the use of single monocular camera data to quantify turns by PD patients in a home setting.</p>

                  <p>Current long context large language models (LLMs) can process inputs up to 100,000 tokens, yet struggle to generate outputs exceeding even a modest length of 2,000 words.Through controlled experiments, we find that the model's effective generation length is inherently bounded by the sample it has seen during supervised fine-tuning (SFT).In other words, their output limitation is due to the scarcity of long-output examples in existing SFT datasets.To address this, we introduce AgentWrite, an agent-based pipeline that decomposes ultra-long generation tasks into subtasks, enabling off-the-shelf LLMs to generate coherent outputs exceeding 20,000 words.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Leveraging AgentWrite, we construct LongWriter-6k, a dataset containing 6,000 SFT data with output lengths ranging from 2k to 32k words. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.84</span></span>By incorporating this dataset into model training, we successfully scale the output length of existing models to over 10,000 words while maintaining output quality.We also develop LongBench-Write, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating ultra-long generation capabilities.Our 9B parameter model, further improved through DPO, achieves state-of-the-art performance on this benchmark, surpassing even much larger proprietary models.In general, our work demonstrates that existing long context LLM already possesses the potential for a larger output window--all you need is data with extended output during model alignment to unlock this capability.Our code & models are at: https://github.com/THUDM/LongWriter.</p>

                  <p>As diverse linguistic communities and users adopt large language models (LLMs), assessing their safety across languages becomes critical.Despite ongoing efforts to make LLMs safe, they can still be made to behave unsafely with jailbreaking, a technique in which models are prompted to act outside their operational guidelines.Research on LLM safety and jailbreaking, however, has so far mostly focused on English, limiting our understanding of LLM safety in other languages.We contribute towards closing this gap by investigating the effectiveness of many-shot jailbreaking, where models are prompted with unsafe demonstrations to induce unsafe behaviour, in Italian.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To enable our analysis, we create a new dataset of unsafe Italian question-answer pairs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.845</span></span>With this dataset, we identify clear safety vulnerabilities in four families of open-weight LLMs.We find that the models exhibit unsafe behaviors even when prompted with few unsafe demonstrations, and -- more alarmingly -- that this tendency rapidly escalates with more demonstrations.</p>

                  <p>Standard natural language processing (NLP) pipelines operate on symbolic representations of language, which typically consist of sequences of discrete tokens.However, creating an analogous representation for ancient logographic writing systems is an extremely labor intensive process that requires expert knowledge.At present, a large portion of logographic data persists in a purely visual form due to the absence of transcription -- this issue poses a bottleneck for researchers seeking to apply NLP toolkits to study ancient logographic languages: most of the relevant data are images of writing.   This paper investigates whether direct processing of visual representations of language offers a potential solution.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We introduce LogogramNLP, the first benchmark enabling NLP analysis of ancient logographic languages, featuring both transcribed and visual datasets for four writing systems along with annotations for tasks like classification, translation, and parsing. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.731</span></span>Our experiments compare systems that employ recent visual and text encoding strategies as backbones.The results demonstrate that visual representations outperform textual representations for some investigated tasks, suggesting that visual processing pipelines may unlock a large amount of cultural heritage data of logographic languages for NLP-based analyses.</p>

                  <p>Vision transformers (ViTs) excel in computer vision for modeling long-term dependencies, yet face two key challenges for image quality assessment (IQA): discarding fine details during patch embedding, and requiring extensive training data due to lack of inductive biases.In this study, we propose a Global-Local progressive INTegration network for IQA, called GlintIQA, to address these issues through three key components: 1) Hybrid feature extraction combines ViT-based global feature extractor (VGFE) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs)-based local feature extractor (CLFE) to capture global coarse-grained features and local fine-grained features, respectively.The incorporation of CNNs mitigates the patch-level information loss and inductive bias constraints inherent to ViT architectures.2) Progressive feature integration leverages diverse kernel sizes in embedding to spatially align coarse- and fine-grained features, and progressively aggregate these features by interactively stacking channel-wise attention and spatial enhancement modules to build effective quality-aware representations.3) Content similarity-based labeling approach is proposed that automatically assigns quality labels to images with diverse content based on subjective quality scores.This addresses the scarcity of labeled training data in synthetic datasets and bolsters model generalization.The experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, yielding 5.04% average SROCC gains on cross-authentic dataset evaluations.Moreover, our model and its counterpart pre-trained on the proposed dataset respectively exhibited 5.40% and 13.23% improvements on across-synthetic datasets evaluation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The codes and proposed dataset will be released at https://github.com/XiaoqiWang/GlintIQA. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.778</span></span></p>

                  <p>Facial wrinkle detection plays a crucial role in cosmetic dermatology.Precise manual segmentation of facial wrinkles is challenging and time-consuming, with inherent subjectivity leading to inconsistent results among graders.To address this issue, we propose two solutions.First, we build and release the first public facial wrinkle dataset, `FFHQ-Wrinkle', an extension of the NVIDIA FFHQ dataset.This dataset includes 1,000 images with human labels and 50,000 images with automatically generated weak labels.This dataset can foster the research community to develop advanced wrinkle detection algorithms.Second, we introduce a training strategy for U-Net-like encoder-decoder models to detect wrinkles across the face automatically.Our method employs a two-stage training strategy: texture map pretraining and finetuning on human-labeled data.Initially, we pretrain models on a large dataset with weak labels (N=50k) or masked texture maps generated through computer vision techniques, without human intervention.Subsequently, we finetune the models using human-labeled data (N=1k), which consists of manually labeled wrinkle masks.During finetuning, the network inputs a combination of RGB and masked texture maps, comprising four channels.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We effectively combine labels from multiple annotators to minimize subjectivity in manual labeling. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.661</span></span>Our strategies demonstrate improved segmentation performance in facial wrinkle segmentation both quantitatively and visually compared to existing pretraining methods.</p>

                  <p>In this work, we make the first attempt to construct a learning-based single-point annotation paradigm for infrared small target label generation (IRSTLG).Our intuition is that label generation requires just one more point prompt than target detection: IRSTLG can be regarded as an infrared small target detection (IRSTD) task with the target location hint.Based on this insight, we introduce an energy double guided single-point prompt (EDGSP) framework, which adeptly transforms the target detection network into a refined label generation method.Specifically, the proposed EDGSP includes: 1) target energy initialization (TEI) to create a foundational outline for sufficient shape evolution of pseudo label, 2) double prompt embedding (DPE) for rapid localization of interested regions and reinforcement of individual differences to avoid label adhesion, and 3) bounding box-based matching (BBM) to eliminate false alarms.Experimental results show that pseudo labels generated by three baselines equipped with EDGSP achieve 100% object-level probability of detection (Pd) and 0% false-alarm rate (Fa) on SIRST, NUDT-SIRST, and IRSTD-1k datasets, with a pixel-level intersection over union (IoU) improvement of 13.28% over state-of-the-art label generation methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, the downstream detection task reveals that our centroid-annotated pseudo labels surpass full labels, even with coarse single-point annotations, it still achieves 99.5% performance of full labeling. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.639</span></span></p>

                  <p>The FIFA World Cup in Qatar was discussed extensively in the news and on social media.Due to news reports with allegations of human rights violations, there were calls to boycott it.Wearing a OneLove armband was part of a planned protest activity.Controversy around the armband arose when FIFA threatened to sanction captains who wear it.To understand what topics Twitter users Tweeted about and what the opinion of German Twitter users was towards the OneLove armband, we performed an analysis of German Tweets published during the World Cup using in-context learning with LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We validated the labels on human annotations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.686</span></span>We found that Twitter users initially discussed the armband's impact, LGBT rights, and politics; after the ban, the conversation shifted towards politics in sports in general, accompanied by a subtle shift in sentiment towards neutrality.Our evaluation serves as a framework for future research to explore the impact of sports activism and evolving public sentiment.This is especially useful in settings where labeling datasets for specific opinions is unfeasible, such as when events are unfolding.</p>

                  <p>Software comprehension, especially of new code bases, is time consuming for developers, especially in large projects with multiple functionalities spanning various domains.One strategy to reduce this effort involves annotating files with meaningful labels that describe the functionalities contained.However, prior research has so far focused on classifying the whole project using README files as a proxy, resulting in little information gained for the developers.   Our objective is to streamline the labelling of files with the correct application domains using source code as input.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To achieve this, in prior work, we evaluated the ability to annotate files automatically using a weak labelling approach.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.681</span></span>This paper presents AutoFL, a tool for automatically labelling software repositories from source code.AutoFL allows multi-granular annotations including: \textit{file}, \textit{package}, and \textit{project} -level.

                  <p>Penetration testing, a critical component of cybersecurity, typically requires extensive time and effort to find vulnerabilities.Beginners in this field often benefit from collaborative approaches with the community or experts.To address this, we develop CIPHER (Cybersecurity Intelligent Penetration-testing Helper for Ethical Researchers), a large language model specifically trained to assist in penetration testing tasks.We trained CIPHER using over 300 high-quality write-ups of vulnerable machines, hacking techniques, and documentation of open-source penetration testing tools.Additionally, we introduced the Findings, Action, Reasoning, and Results (FARR) Flow augmentation, a novel method to augment penetration testing write-ups to establish a fully automated pentesting simulation benchmark tailored for large language models.This approach fills a significant gap in traditional cybersecurity Q\&A benchmarks and provides a realistic and rigorous standard for evaluating AI's technical knowledge, reasoning capabilities, and practical utility in dynamic penetration testing scenarios.In our assessments, CIPHER achieved the best overall performance in providing accurate suggestion responses compared to other open-source penetration testing models of similar size and even larger state-of-the-art models like Llama 3 70B and Qwen1.5 72B Chat, particularly on insane difficulty machine setups.This demonstrates that the current capabilities of general LLMs are insufficient for effectively guiding users through the penetration testing process.We also discuss the potential for improvement through scaling and the development of better benchmarks using FARR Flow augmentation results.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our benchmark will be released publicly at https://github.com/ibndias/CIPHER. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.65</span></span></p>

                  <p>The ICP registration algorithm has been a preferred method for LiDAR-based robot localization for nearly a decade.However, even in modern SLAM solutions, ICP can degrade and become unreliable in geometrically ill-conditioned environments.Current solutions primarily focus on utilizing additional sources of information, such as external odometry, to either replace the degenerate directions of the optimization solution or add additional constraints in a sensor-fusion setup afterward.In response, this work investigates and compares new and existing degeneracy mitigation methods for robust LiDAR-based localization and analyzes the efficacy of these approaches in degenerate environments for the first time in the literature at this scale.Specifically, this work proposes and investigates i) the incorporation of different types of constraints into the ICP algorithm, ii) the effect of using active or passive degeneracy mitigation techniques, and iii) the choice of utilizing global point cloud registration methods on the ill-conditioned ICP problem in LiDAR degenerate environments.The study results are validated through multiple real-world field and simulated experiments.The analysis shows that active optimization degeneracy mitigation is necessary and advantageous in the absence of reliable external estimate assistance for LiDAR-SLAM.Furthermore, introducing degeneracy-aware hard constraints in the optimization before or during the optimization is shown to perform better in the wild than by including the constraints after.Moreover, with heuristic fine-tuned parameters, soft constraints can provide equal or better results in complex ill-conditioned scenarios.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The implementations used in the analysis of this work are made publicly available to the community. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have great success in natural language processing tasks such as response generation.However, their use in tabular data has been limited due to their inferior performance compared to traditional machine learning models (TMLs) such as XGBoost.We find that the pre-trained knowledge of LLMs enables them to interpret new variables that appear in a test without additional training, a capability central to the concept of Out-of-Variable (OOV).From the findings, we propose a Language-Based-Classifier (LBC), a classifier that maximizes the benefits of LLMs to outperform TMLs on OOV tasks.LBC employs three key methodological strategies: 1) Categorical changes to adjust data to better fit the model's understanding, 2) Advanced order and indicator to enhance data representation to the model, and 3) Using verbalizer to map logit scores to classes during inference to generate model predictions.These strategies, combined with the pre-trained knowledge of LBC, emphasize the model's ability to effectively handle OOV tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We empirically and theoretically validate the superiority of LBC. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.608</span></span>LBC is the first study to apply an LLM-based model to OOV tasks.The source code is at https://github.com/ASDASDanonymous/Language-Based-Classifier-forOOVtasks.</p>

                  <p>Network energy saving has received great attention from operators and vendors to reduce energy consumption and CO2 emissions to the environment as well as significantly reduce costs for mobile network operators.However, the design of energy-saving networks also needs to ensure the mobile users' (MUs) QoS requirements such as throughput requirements (TR).This work considers a mobile cellular network including many ground base stations (GBSs), and some GBSs are intentionally turned off due to network energy saving (NES) or crash, so the MUs located in these outage GBSs are not served in time.Based on this observation, we propose the problem of maximizing the total achievable throughput in the network by optimizing the GBSs' antenna tilt and adaptive transmission power with a given number of served MUs satisfied.Notice that, the MU is considered successfully served if its Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) and throughput requirement are satisfied.The formulated optimization problem becomes difficult to solve with multiple binary variables and non-convex constraints along with random throughput requirements and random placement of MUs.We propose a Deep Q-learning-based algorithm to help the network learn the uncertainty and dynamics of the transmission environment.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive simulation results show that our proposed algorithm achieves much better performance than the benchmark schemes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.781</span></span></p>

                  <p>Learning with Noisy labels (LNL) poses a significant challenge for the Machine Learning community.Some of the most widely used approaches that select as clean samples for which the model itself (the in-training model) has high confidence, e.g., `small loss', can suffer from the so called `self-confirmation' bias.This bias arises because the in-training model, is at least partially trained on the noisy labels.Furthermore, in the classification case, an additional challenge arises because some of the label noise is between classes that are visually very similar (`hard noise').This paper addresses these challenges by proposing a method (\textit{CLIPCleaner}) that leverages CLIP, a powerful Vision-Language (VL) model for constructing a zero-shot classifier for efficient, offline, clean sample selection.This has the advantage that the sample selection is decoupled from the in-training model and that the sample selection is aware of the semantic and visual similarities between the classes due to the way that CLIP is trained.We provide theoretical justifications and empirical evidence to demonstrate the advantages of CLIP for LNL compared to conventional pre-trained models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Compared to current methods that combine iterative sample selection with various techniques, \textit{CLIPCleaner} offers a simple, single-step approach that achieves competitive or superior performance on benchmark datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a VL model has been used for sample selection to address the problem of Learning with Noisy Labels (LNL), highlighting their potential in the domain.</p>

                  <p>Mesh reconstruction based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) is popular in a variety of applications such as computer graphics, virtual reality, and medical imaging due to its efficiency in handling complex geometric structures and facilitating real-time rendering.However, existing works often fail to capture fine geometric details accurately and struggle with optimizing rendering quality.To address these challenges, we propose a novel algorithm that progressively generates and optimizes meshes from multi-view images.Our approach initiates with the training of a NeRF model to establish an initial Signed Distance Field (SDF) and a view-dependent appearance field.Subsequently, we iteratively refine the SDF through a differentiable mesh extraction method, continuously updating both the vertex positions and their connectivity based on the loss from mesh differentiable rasterization, while also optimizing the appearance representation.To further leverage high-fidelity and detail-rich representations from NeRF, we propose an online-learning strategy based on Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) to enhance viewpoints by adaptively incorporating images rendered by the initial NeRF model into the training dataset.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method delivers highly competitive and robust performance in both mesh rendering quality and geometric quality. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span></p>

                  <p>Image restoration endeavors to reconstruct a high-quality, detail-rich image from a degraded counterpart, which is a pivotal process in photography and various computer vision systems.In real-world scenarios, different types of degradation can cause the loss of image details at various scales and degrade image contrast.Existing methods predominantly rely on CNN and Transformer to capture multi-scale representations.However, these methods are often limited by the high computational complexity of Transformers and the constrained receptive field of CNN, which hinder them from achieving superior performance and efficiency in image restoration.To address these challenges, we propose a novel Multi-Scale State-Space Model-based (MS-Mamba) for efficient image restoration that enhances the capacity for multi-scale representation learning through our proposed global and regional SSM modules.Additionally, an Adaptive Gradient Block (AGB) and a Residual Fourier Block (RFB) are proposed to improve the network's detail extraction capabilities by capturing gradients in various directions and facilitating learning details in the frequency domain.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on nine public benchmarks across four classic image restoration tasks, image deraining, dehazing, denoising, and low-light enhancement, demonstrate that our proposed method achieves new state-of-the-art performance while maintaining low computational complexity. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.684</span></span>The source code will be publicly available.</p>

                  <p>Deep model training on extensive datasets is increasingly becoming cost-prohibitive, prompting the widespread adoption of deep model fusion techniques to leverage knowledge from pre-existing models.From simple weight averaging to more sophisticated methods like AdaMerging, model fusion effectively improves model performance and accelerates the development of new models.However, potential interference between parameters of individual models and the lack of interpretability in the fusion progress remain significant challenges.Existing methods often try to resolve the parameter interference issue by evaluating attributes of parameters, such as their magnitude or sign, or by parameter pruning.In this study, we begin by examining the fine-tuning of linear layers through the lens of subspace analysis and explicitly define parameter interference as an optimization problem to shed light on this subject.Subsequently, we introduce an innovative approach to model fusion called zero-shot Sparse MIxture of Low-rank Experts (SMILE) construction, which allows for the upscaling of source models into an MoE model without extra data or further training.Our approach relies on the observation that fine-tuning mostly keeps the important parts from the pre-training, but it uses less significant or unused areas to adapt to new tasks.Also, the issue of parameter interference, which is intrinsically intractable in the original parameter space, can be managed by expanding the dimensions.We conduct extensive experiments across diverse scenarios, such as image classification and text generalization tasks, using full fine-tuning and LoRA fine-tuning, and we apply our method to large language models (CLIP models, Flan-T5 models, and Mistral-7B models), highlighting the adaptability and scalability of SMILE.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code is available at https://github.com/tanganke/fusion_bench <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.63</span></span></p>

                  <p>During software development, developers often make numerous modifications to the software to address existing issues or implement new features.However, certain changes may inadvertently have a detrimental impact on the overall system performance.To ensure that the performance of new software releases does not degrade, existing practices rely on system-level performance testing, such as load testing, or component-level performance testing to detect performance regressions.However, performance testing for the entire system is often expensive and time-consuming, posing challenges to adapting to the rapid release cycles common in modern DevOps practices.System-level performance testing cannot be conducted until the system is fully built and deployed.On the other hand, component-level testing focuses on isolated components, neglecting overall system performance and the impact of system workloads.   In this paper, we propose a novel approach to early detection of performance regressions by bridging the local performance data generated by component-level testing and the system-level architectural models.Our approach uses local performance data to identify deviations at the component level, and then propagate these deviations to the architectural model.We then use the architectural model to predict regressions in the performance of the overall system.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate our approach on two open-source benchmark systems and show that it can effectively detect end-to-end system performance regressions from local performance deviations with different intensities and under various system workloads. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.719</span></span>More importantly, our approach can detect regressions as early as in the development phase, in contrast to existing approaches that require the system to be fully built and deployed.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our approach is lightweight and can complement traditional system performance testing when testing resources are scarce. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.637</span></span></p>

                  <p>Human motion prediction is crucial for human-centric multimedia understanding and interacting.Current methods typically rely on ground truth human poses as observed input, which is not practical for real-world scenarios where only raw visual sensor data is available.To implement these methods in practice, a pre-phrase of pose estimation is essential.However, such two-stage approaches often lead to performance degradation due to the accumulation of errors.Moreover, reducing raw visual data to sparse keypoint representations significantly diminishes the density of information, resulting in the loss of fine-grained features.In this paper, we propose \textit{LiDAR-HMP}, the first single-LiDAR-based 3D human motion prediction approach, which receives the raw LiDAR point cloud as input and forecasts future 3D human poses directly.Building upon our novel structure-aware body feature descriptor, LiDAR-HMP adaptively maps the observed motion manifold to future poses and effectively models the spatial-temporal correlations of human motions for further refinement of prediction results.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on two public benchmarks and demonstrates remarkable robustness and efficacy in real-world deployments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span></p>

                  <p>Object pose estimation is essential to many industrial applications involving robotic manipulation, navigation, and augmented reality.Current generalizable object pose estimators, i.e., approaches that do not need to be trained per object, rely on accurate 3D models.Predominantly, CAD models are used, which can be hard to obtain in practice.At the same time, it is often possible to acquire images of an object.Naturally, this leads to the question whether 3D models reconstructed from images are sufficient to facilitate accurate object pose estimation.We aim to answer this question by proposing a novel benchmark for measuring the impact of 3D reconstruction quality on pose estimation accuracy.Our benchmark provides calibrated images for object reconstruction registered with the test images of the YCB-V dataset for pose evaluation under the BOP benchmark format.Detailed experiments with multiple state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction and object pose estimation approaches show that the geometry produced by modern reconstruction methods is often sufficient for accurate pose estimation.Our experiments lead to interesting observations: (1) Standard metrics for measuring 3D reconstruction quality are not necessarily indicative of pose estimation accuracy, which shows the need for dedicated benchmarks such as ours.(2) Classical, non-learning-based approaches can perform on par with modern learning-based reconstruction techniques and can even offer a better reconstruction time-pose accuracy tradeoff.(3) There is still a sizable gap between performance with reconstructed and with CAD models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To foster research on closing this gap, our benchmark is publicly available at https://github.com/VarunBurde/reconstruction_pose_benchmark}. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span></p>

                  <p>Assessing the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) is often challenging, in part, because it is hard to find tasks to which they have not been exposed during training.We take one step to address this challenge by turning to a new task: focusing on symbolic graphics programs, which are a popular representation for graphics content that procedurally generates visual data.LLMs have shown exciting promise towards program synthesis, but do they understand symbolic graphics programs?Unlike conventional programs, symbolic graphics programs can be translated to graphics content.Here, we characterize an LLM's understanding of symbolic programs in terms of their ability to answer questions related to the graphics content.This task is challenging as the questions are difficult to answer from the symbolic programs alone -- yet, they would be easy to answer from the corresponding graphics content as we verify through a human experiment.To understand symbolic programs, LLMs may need to possess the ability to imagine how the corresponding graphics content would look without directly accessing the rendered visual content.We use this task to evaluate LLMs by creating a large benchmark for the semantic understanding of symbolic graphics programs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This benchmark is built via program-graphics correspondence, hence requiring minimal human efforts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.7</span></span>We evaluate current LLMs on our benchmark to elucidate a preliminary assessment of their ability to reason about visual scenes from programs.We find that this task distinguishes existing LLMs and models considered good at reasoning perform better.Lastly, we introduce Symbolic Instruction Tuning (SIT) to improve this ability.Specifically, we query GPT4-o with questions and images generated by symbolic programs.Such data are then used to finetune an LLM.We also find that SIT data can improve the general instruction following ability of LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Penetration testing, a critical component of cybersecurity, typically requires extensive time and effort to find vulnerabilities.Beginners in this field often benefit from collaborative approaches with the community or experts.To address this, we develop CIPHER (Cybersecurity Intelligent Penetration-testing Helper for Ethical Researchers), a large language model specifically trained to assist in penetration testing tasks.We trained CIPHER using over 300 high-quality write-ups of vulnerable machines, hacking techniques, and documentation of open-source penetration testing tools.Additionally, we introduced the Findings, Action, Reasoning, and Results (FARR) Flow augmentation, a novel method to augment penetration testing write-ups to establish a fully automated pentesting simulation benchmark tailored for large language models.This approach fills a significant gap in traditional cybersecurity Q\&A benchmarks and provides a realistic and rigorous standard for evaluating AI's technical knowledge, reasoning capabilities, and practical utility in dynamic penetration testing scenarios.In our assessments, CIPHER achieved the best overall performance in providing accurate suggestion responses compared to other open-source penetration testing models of similar size and even larger state-of-the-art models like Llama 3 70B and Qwen1.5 72B Chat, particularly on insane difficulty machine setups.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This demonstrates that the current capabilities of general LLMs are insufficient for effectively guiding users through the penetration testing process. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.775</span></span>We also discuss the potential for improvement through scaling and the development of better benchmarks using FARR Flow augmentation results.Our benchmark will be released publicly at https://github.com/ibndias/CIPHER.</p>

                  <p>Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating high-quality images given a text prompt.However, ensuring the prompt-image alignment remains a considerable challenge, i.e., generating images that faithfully align with the prompt's semantics.Recent works attempt to improve the faithfulness by optimizing the latent code, which potentially could cause the latent code to go out-of-distribution and thus produce unrealistic images.In this paper, we propose FRAP, a simple, yet effective approach based on adaptively adjusting the per-token prompt weights to improve prompt-image alignment and authenticity of the generated images.We design an online algorithm to adaptively update each token's weight coefficient, which is achieved by minimizing a unified objective function that encourages object presence and the binding of object-modifier pairs.Through extensive evaluations, we show FRAP generates images with significantly higher prompt-image alignment to prompts from complex datasets, while having a lower average latency compared to recent latent code optimization methods, e.g., 4 seconds faster than D&B on the COCO-Subject dataset.Furthermore, through visual comparisons and evaluation on the CLIP-IQA-Real metric, we show that FRAP not only improves prompt-image alignment but also generates more authentic images with realistic appearances.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also explore combining FRAP with prompt rewriting LLM to recover their degraded prompt-image alignment, where we observe improvements in both prompt-image alignment and image quality. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.655</span></span></p>

                  <p>As inference on Large Language Models (LLMs) emerges as an important workload in machine learning applications, weight quantization has become a standard technique for efficient GPU deployment.Quantization not only reduces model size, but has also been shown to yield substantial speedups for single-user inference, due to reduced memory movement, with low accuracy impact.Yet, it remains open whether speedups are achievable also in \emph{batched} settings with multiple parallel clients, which are highly relevant for practical serving.It is unclear whether GPU kernels can be designed to remain practically memory-bound, while supporting the substantially increased compute requirements of batched workloads.   This paper resolves this question positively by describing the design of Mixed-precision Auto-Regressive LINear kernels, called MARLIN.Concretely, given a model whose weights are compressed via quantization to, e.g., 4 bits per element, MARLIN shows that batchsizes up to 16-32 can be supported with close to maximum ($4\times$) quantization speedup, and larger batchsizes up to 64-128 with gradually decreasing, but still significant, acceleration.MARLIN accomplishes this via a combination of techniques, such as asynchronous memory access, complex task scheduling and pipelining, and bespoke quantization support.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experiments show that MARLIN's near-optimal performance on individual LLM layers across different scenarios can also lead to end-to-end LLM inference speedups (of up to $2.8\times$) when integrated with the popular vLLM serving engine. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.721</span></span>Finally, MARLIN is extensible to further compression techniques, like NVIDIA 2:4 sparsity, leading to additional speedups.</p>

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to early detection of performance regressions by bridging the local performance data generated by component-level testing and the system-level architectural models.Our approach uses local performance data to identify deviations at the component level, and then propagate these deviations to the architectural model.We then use the architectural model to predict regressions in the performance of the overall system.We evaluate our approach on two open-source benchmark systems and show that it can effectively detect end-to-end system performance regressions from local performance deviations with different intensities and under various system workloads.More importantly, our approach can detect regressions as early as in the development phase, in contrast to existing approaches that require the system to be fully built and deployed.Our approach is lightweight and can complement traditional system performance testing when testing resources are scarce.</p>

                Towards Fixing Panic Bugs for Real-world Rust Programs

                  <p>The Rust programming language has garnered significant attention due to its robust safety features and memory management capabilities.Despite its guaranteed memory safety, Rust programs still suffer from runtime errors that are unmanageable, i.e., panic errors.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Notably, over half of the bugs in rustc, Rust's own compiler, are attributable to crash stemming from panic errors. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>However, understanding root causes and resolving these panics often requires substantial effort due to the limited information provided, and the stack backtrace could be intricate, often omitting the actual fault locations.Although numerous automated program repair techniques exist, we observe that the prevailing fix patterns do not readily apply to Rust programs due to natural differences in language mechanisms.To tackle the above challenges, this paper introduces a systematic study aimed at fixing Rust panic bugs.We commence by assembling a dataset, namely Panic4R, which includes 102 real panic bugs and their fixes from the top 500 most downloaded open-source crates.By analyzing Rust's implementation, we identify Rust-specific patterns for fixing panic bugs, which can aid in understanding and providing guidance for generating patches.Finally, we design and implement the first automated fixing tool, PanicKiller, for Rust panic bugs, which effectively generates correct patches on the real-world large-scale dataset, and has already assisted in the resolution of 28 panic bugs in open-source projects.Each resolved issue has been validated by the developers and merged into the respective codebases.</p>

                ThinkRepair: Self-Directed Automated Program Repair

                  <p><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Though many approaches have been proposed for Automated Program Repair (APR) and indeed achieved remarkable performance, they still have limitations in fixing bugs that require analyzing and reasoning about the logic of the buggy program. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.617</span></span>Recently, large language models (LLMs) instructed by prompt engineering have attracted much attention for their powerful ability to address many kinds of tasks including bug-fixing.However, the quality of the prompt will highly affect the ability of LLMs and manually constructing high-quality prompts is a costly endeavor.   To address this limitation, we propose a self-directed LLM-based automated program repair, ThinkRepair, with two main phases: collection phase and fixing phase.The former phase automatically collects various chains of thoughts that constitute pre-fixed knowledge by instructing LLMs with the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompt.The latter phase targets fixing a bug by first selecting examples for few-shot learning and second automatically interacting with LLMs, optionally appending with feedback of testing information.   Evaluations on two widely studied datasets (Defects4J and QuixBugs) by comparing ThinkRepair with 12 SOTA APRs indicate the priority of ThinkRepair in fixing bugs.Notably, ThinkRepair fixes 98 bugs and improves baselines by 27%-344.4% on Defects4J V1.2.On Defects4J V2.0, ThinkRepair fixes 12-65 more bugs than the SOTA APRs.Additionally, ThinkRepair also makes a considerable improvement on QuixBugs (31 for Java and 21 for Python at most).</p>
