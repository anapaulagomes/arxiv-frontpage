                  <p>Object affordance reasoning, the ability to infer object functionalities based on physical properties, is fundamental for task-oriented planning and activities in both humans and Artificial Intelligence (AI).This capability, required for planning and executing daily activities in a task-oriented manner, relies on commonsense knowledge of object physics and functionalities, extending beyond simple object recognition.Current computational models for affordance reasoning from perception lack generalizability, limiting their applicability in novel scenarios.Meanwhile, comprehensive Large Language Models (LLMs) with emerging reasoning capabilities are challenging to deploy on local devices for task-oriented manipulations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Here, we introduce LVIS-Aff, a large-scale dataset comprising 1,496 tasks and 119k images, designed to enhance the generalizability of affordance reasoning from perception. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.719</span></span>Utilizing this dataset, we develop Afford-X, an end-to-end trainable affordance reasoning model that incorporates Verb Attention and Bi-Fusion modules to improve multi-modal understanding.This model achieves up to a 12.1% performance improvement over the best-reported results from non-LLM methods, while also demonstrating a 1.2% enhancement compared to our previous conference paper.Additionally, it maintains a compact 187M parameter size and infers nearly 50 times faster than the GPT-4V API.Our work demonstrates the potential for efficient, generalizable affordance reasoning models that can be deployed on local devices for task-oriented manipulations.We showcase Afford-X's effectiveness in enabling task-oriented manipulations for robots across various tasks and environments, underscoring its efficiency and broad implications for advancing robotics and AI systems in real-world applications.</p>

PE-RL not only improves on overall NPOV quality compared to the strongest baseline ($97.06\%\rightarrow 99.08\%$), but also scores much higher on features linguists identify as key to separating good answers from the best answers ($60.25\%\rightarrow 85.21\%$ for presence of supportive details, $68.74\%\rightarrow 91.43\%$ for absence of oversimplification).A qualitative analysis corroborates this.Finally, our evaluation finds no statistical differences between results on topics that appear in the training dataset and those on separated evaluation topics, which provides strong evidence that our approach to training PE-RL exhibits very effective out of topic generalization.</p>

                  <p>The advancement of visual language models (VLMs) has enhanced mobile device operations, allowing simulated human-like actions to address user requirements.Current VLM-based mobile operating assistants can be structured into three levels: task, subtask, and action.The subtask level, linking high-level goals with low-level executable actions, is crucial for task completion but faces two challenges: ineffective subtasks that lower-level agent cannot execute and inefficient subtasks that fail to contribute to the completion of the higher-level task.These challenges stem from VLM's lack of experience in decomposing subtasks within GUI scenarios in multi-agent architecture.To address these, we propose a new mobile assistant architecture with constrained high-frequency o}ptimized planning (CHOP).Our approach overcomes the VLM's deficiency in GUI scenarios planning by using human-planned subtasks as the basis vector.We evaluate our architecture in both English and Chinese contexts across 20 Apps, demonstrating significant improvements in both effectiveness and efficiency.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our dataset and code is available at https://github.com/Yuqi-Zhou/CHOP <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.853</span></span></p>

                  <p>Preference learning enhances Code LLMs beyond supervised fine-tuning by leveraging relative quality comparisons.Existing methods construct preference pairs from   candidates based on test case success, treating the higher pass rate sample as positive and the lower as negative.However, this approach does not pinpoint specific errors in the code, which prevents the model from learning more informative error correction patterns, as aligning failing code as a whole lacks the granularity needed to capture meaningful error-resolution relationships.To address these issues, we propose IterPref, a new preference alignment framework that mimics human iterative debugging to refine Code LLMs.IterPref explicitly locates error regions and aligns the corresponding tokens via a tailored DPO algorithm.To generate informative pairs, we introduce the CodeFlow dataset, where samples are iteratively refined until passing tests, with modifications capturing error corrections.Extensive experiments show that a diverse suite of Code LLMs equipped with IterPref achieves significant performance gains in code generation and improves on challenging tasks like BigCodeBench.In-depth analysis reveals that IterPref yields fewer errors.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and data will be made publicaly available. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.832</span></span></p>

                  <p>Developing clinically useful cell-level analysis tools in digital pathology remains challenging due to limitations in dataset granularity, inconsistent annotations, high computational demands, and difficulties integrating new technologies into workflows.To address these issues, we propose a solution that enhances data quality, model performance, and usability by creating a lightweight, extensible cell segmentation and classification model.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>First, we update data labels through cross-relabeling to refine annotations of PanNuke and MoNuSAC, producing a unified dataset with seven distinct cell types. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.794</span></span>Second, we leverage the H-Optimus foundation model as a fixed encoder to improve feature representation for simultaneous segmentation and classification tasks.Third, to address foundation models' computational demands, we distill knowledge to reduce model size and complexity while maintaining comparable performance.Finally, we integrate the distilled model into QuPath, a widely used open-source digital pathology platform.Results demonstrate improved segmentation and classification performance using the H-Optimus-based model compared to a CNN-based model.Specifically, average $R^2$ improved from 0.575 to 0.871, and average $PQ$ score improved from 0.450 to 0.492, indicating better alignment with actual cell counts and enhanced segmentation quality.The distilled model maintains comparable performance while reducing parameter count by a factor of 48.By reducing computational complexity and integrating into workflows, this approach may significantly impact diagnostics, reduce pathologist workload, and improve outcomes.Although the method shows promise, extensive validation is necessary prior to clinical deployment.</p>

                  <p>Research on egocentric tasks in computer vision has mostly focused on head-mounted cameras, such as fisheye cameras or embedded cameras inside immersive headsets.We argue that the increasing miniaturization of optical sensors will lead to the prolific integration of cameras into many more body-worn devices at various locations.This will bring fresh perspectives to established tasks in computer vision and benefit key areas such as human motion tracking, body pose estimation, or action recognition -- particularly for the lower body, which is typically occluded.   In this paper, we introduce EgoSim, a novel simulator of body-worn cameras that generates realistic egocentric renderings from multiple perspectives across a wearer's body.A key feature of EgoSim is its use of real motion capture data to render motion artifacts, which are especially noticeable with arm- or leg-worn cameras.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, we introduce MultiEgoView, a dataset of egocentric footage from six body-worn cameras and ground-truth full-body 3D poses during several activities: 119 hours of data are derived from AMASS motion sequences in four high-fidelity virtual environments, which we augment with 5 hours of real-world motion data from 13 participants using six GoPro cameras and 3D body pose references from an Xsens motion capture suit.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.833</span></span>We demonstrate EgoSim's effectiveness by training an end-to-end video-only 3D pose estimation network.Analyzing its domain gap, we show that our dataset and simulator substantially aid training for inference on real-world data.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>EgoSim code & MultiEgoView dataset: https://siplab.org/projects/EgoSim <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.836</span></span></p>

                  <p>Masked language modelling (MLM) as a pretraining objective has been widely adopted in genomic sequence modelling.While pretrained models can successfully serve as encoders for various downstream tasks, the distribution shift between pretraining and inference detrimentally impacts performance, as the pretraining task is to map [MASK] tokens to predictions, yet the [MASK] is absent during downstream applications.This means the encoder does not prioritize its encodings of non-[MASK] tokens, and expends parameters and compute on work only relevant to the MLM task, despite this being irrelevant at deployment time.In this work, we propose a modified encoder-decoder architecture based on the masked autoencoder framework, designed to address this inefficiency within a BERT-based transformer.We empirically show that the resulting mismatch is particularly detrimental in genomic pipelines where models are often used for feature extraction without fine-tuning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate our approach on the BIOSCAN-5M dataset, comprising over 2 million unique DNA barcodes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.727</span></span>We achieve substantial performance gains in both closed-world and open-world classification tasks when compared against causal models and bidirectional architectures pretrained with MLM tasks.</p>

                  <p>Our ability to continuously acquire, organize, and leverage knowledge is a key feature of human intelligence that AI systems must approximate to unlock their full potential.Given the challenges in continual learning with large language models (LLMs), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become the dominant way to introduce new information.However, its reliance on vector retrieval hinders its ability to mimic the dynamic and interconnected nature of human long-term memory.Recent RAG approaches augment vector embeddings with various structures like knowledge graphs to address some of these gaps, namely sense-making and associativity.However, their performance on more basic factual memory tasks drops considerably below standard RAG.We address this unintended deterioration and propose HippoRAG 2, a framework that outperforms standard RAG comprehensively on factual, sense-making, and associative memory tasks.HippoRAG 2 builds upon the Personalized PageRank algorithm used in HippoRAG and enhances it with deeper passage integration and more effective online use of an LLM.This combination pushes this RAG system closer to the effectiveness of human long-term memory, achieving a 7% improvement in associative memory tasks over the state-of-the-art embedding model while also exhibiting superior factual knowledge and sense-making memory capabilities.This work paves the way for non-parametric continual learning for LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and data will be released at https://github.com/OSU-NLP-Group/HippoRAG. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.727</span></span></p>

In this study, we evaluate both general-purpose and medical-specific LLMs for medication recommendation tasks.Our findings reveal that LLMs frequently encounter the challenge of overprescribing, leading to heightened clinical risks and diminished medication recommendation accuracy.To address this issue, we propose Language-Assisted Medication Recommendation (LAMO), which employs a parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach to tailor open-source LLMs for optimal performance in medication recommendation scenarios.LAMO leverages the wealth of clinical information within clinical notes, a resource often underutilized in traditional methodologies.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>As a result of our approach, LAMO outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by over 10% in internal validation accuracy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.687</span></span>Furthermore, temporal and external validations demonstrate LAMO's robust generalization capabilities across various temporal and hospital contexts.Additionally, an out-of-distribution medication recommendation experiment demonstrates LAMO's remarkable accuracy even with medications outside the training data.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled LLM-based agents to successfully tackle interactive planning tasks.However, despite their successes, existing approaches often suffer from planning hallucinations and require retraining for each new agent.To address these challenges, we propose the Meta Plan Optimization (MPO) framework, which enhances agent planning capabilities by directly incorporating explicit guidance.Unlike previous methods that rely on complex knowledge, which either require significant human effort or lack quality assurance, MPO leverages high-level general guidance through meta plans to assist agent planning and enables continuous optimization of the meta plans based on feedback from the agent's task execution.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experiments conducted on two representative tasks demonstrate that MPO significantly outperforms existing baselines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.629</span></span>Moreover, our analysis indicates that MPO provides a plug-and-play solution that enhances both task completion efficiency and generalization capabilities in previous unseen scenarios.</p>

                  <p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have gained significant attention due to their biological plausibility and energy efficiency, making them promising alternatives to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs).However, the performance gap between SNNs and ANNs remains a substantial challenge hindering the widespread adoption of SNNs.In this paper, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Attention Aggregator SNN (STAA-SNN) framework, which dynamically focuses on and captures both spatial and temporal dependencies.First, we introduce a spike-driven self-attention mechanism specifically designed for SNNs.Additionally, we pioneeringly incorporate position encoding to integrate latent temporal relationships into the incoming features.For spatial-temporal information aggregation, we employ step attention to selectively amplify relevant features at different steps.Finally, we implement a time-step random dropout strategy to avoid local optima.As a result, STAA-SNN effectively captures both spatial and temporal dependencies, enabling the model to analyze complex patterns and make accurate predictions.The framework demonstrates exceptional performance across diverse datasets and exhibits strong generalization capabilities.Notably, STAA-SNN achieves state-of-the-art results on neuromorphic datasets CIFAR10-DVS, with remarkable performances of 97.14%, 82.05% and 70.40% on the static datasets CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet, respectively.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, our model exhibits improved performance ranging from 0.33\% to 2.80\% with fewer time steps. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.625</span></span>The code for the model is available on GitHub.</p>

                  <p>The ever-growing availability of unlabeled data presents both opportunities and challenges for training artificial intelligence systems.While self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for extracting meaningful representations from vast amounts of unlabeled data, existing methods still struggle to adapt to the non-stationary, non-IID nature of real-world data streams without forgetting previously learned knowledge.Recent works have adopted a repeated cosine annealing schedule for large-scale continual pre-training; however, these schedules (1) inherently cause forgetting during the re-warming phase and (2) have not been systematically compared to existing continual SSL methods.In this work, we systematically compare the widely used cosine schedule with the recently proposed infinite learning rate schedule and empirically find the latter to be a more effective alternative.Our extensive empirical evaluation across diverse image and language datasets demonstrates that the infinite learning rate schedule consistently enhances continual pre-training performance compared to a repeated cosine decay without being restricted to a fixed iteration budget.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For instance, in a small-scale MAE pre-training setup, it outperforms several strong baselines from the literature. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.619</span></span>We then scale up our experiments to larger MAE pre-training and autoregressive language model pre-training.Our results show that the infinite learning rate schedule remains effective at scale, surpassing repeated cosine decay for both MAE pre-training and zero-shot LM benchmarks.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit misaligned confidence scores, usually overestimating the reliability of their predictions.While verbalized confidence in Large Language Models (LLMs) has gained attention, prior work remains divided on whether confidence scores can be systematically steered through prompting.Recent studies even argue that such prompt-induced confidence shifts are negligible, suggesting LLMs' confidence calibration is rigid to linguistic interventions.Contrary to these claims, we first rigorously confirm the existence of directional confidence shifts by probing three models (including GPT3.5, LLAMA3-70b, GPT4) across 7 benchmarks, demonstrating that explicit instructions can inflate or deflate confidence scores in a regulated manner.Based on this observation, we propose a novel framework containing three components: confidence steering, steered confidence aggregation and steered answers selection, named SteeringConf.Our method, SteeringConf, leverages a confidence manipulation mechanism to steer the confidence scores of LLMs in several desired directions, followed by a summarization module that aggregates the steered confidence scores to produce a final prediction.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate our method on 7 benchmarks and it consistently outperforms the baselines in terms of calibration metrics in task of confidence calibration and failure detection. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.733</span></span></p>

                  <p>Fast and accurate estimation of quantiles on data streams coming from communication networks, Internet of Things (IoT), and alike, is at the heart of important data processing applications including statistical analysis, latency monitoring, query optimization for parallel database management systems, and more.Indeed, quantiles are more robust indicators for the underlying distribution, compared to moment-based indicators such as mean and variance.The streaming setting additionally constrains accurate tracking of quantiles, as stream items may arrive at a very high rate and must be processed as quickly as possible and discarded, being their storage usually unfeasible.Since an exact solution is only possible when data are fully stored, the goal in practical contexts is to provide an approximate solution with a provably guaranteed bound on the approximation error committed, while using a minimal amount of space.At the same time, with the increasing amount of personal and sensitive information exchanged, it is essential to design privacy protection techniques to ensure confidentiality and data integrity.In this paper we present the following differentially private streaming algorithms for frugal estimation of a quantile: DP-FRUGAL-1U-L, DP-FRUGAL-1U-G, DP-FRUGAL-1U-\r{ho} and DP-FRUGAL-2U-SA.Frugality refers to the ability of the algorithms to provide a good approximation to the sought quantile using a modest amount of space, either one or two units of memory.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We provide a theoretical analysis and extensive experimental results, in which we also compare DP-FRUGAL-1U-L with LDPQ, a recent state of the art algorithm, and show that DP-FRUGAL-1U-L outperforms LDPQ in both accuracy and speed. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.629</span></span></p>

                  <p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in learning joint representations of visual and textual data, making them powerful tools for tasks such as Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL).CZSL requires models to generalize to novel combinations of visual primitives-such as attributes and objects-that were not explicitly encountered during training.Recent works in prompting for CZSL have focused on modifying inputs for the text encoder, often using static prompts that do not change across varying visual contexts.However, these approaches struggle to fully capture varying visual contexts, as they focus on text adaptation rather than leveraging visual features for compositional reasoning.To address this, we propose Visual Adaptive Prompting System (VAPS) that leverages a learnable visual prompt repository and similarity-based retrieval mechanism within the framework of VLMs to bridge the gap between semantic and visual features.Our method introduces a dynamic visual prompt repository mechanism that selects the most relevant attribute and object prompts based on the visual features of the image.Our proposed system includes a visual prompt adapter that encourages the model to learn a more generalizable embedding space.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments on three CZSL benchmarks, across both closed and open-world scenarios, demonstrate state-of-the-art results. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.658</span></span></p>

                  <p>Network alignment, which aims to find node correspondence across different networks, is the cornerstone of various downstream multi-network and Web mining tasks.Most of the embedding-based methods indirectly model cross-network node relationships by contrasting positive and negative node pairs sampled from hand-crafted strategies, which are vulnerable to graph noises and lead to potential misalignment of nodes.Another line of work based on the optimal transport (OT) theory directly models cross-network node relationships and generates noise-reduced alignments.However, OT methods heavily rely on fixed, pre-defined cost functions that prohibit end-to-end training and are hard to generalize.In this paper, we aim to unify the embedding and OT-based methods in a mutually beneficial manner and propose a joint optimal transport and embedding framework for network alignment named JOENA.For one thing (OT for embedding), through a simple yet effective transformation, the noise-reduced OT mapping serves as an adaptive sampling strategy directly modeling all cross-network node pairs for robust embedding learning.For another (embedding for OT), on top of the learned embeddings, the OT cost can be gradually trained in an end-to-end fashion, which further enhances the alignment quality.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>With a unified objective, the mutual benefits of both methods can be achieved by an alternating optimization schema with guaranteed convergence. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span>Extensive experiments on real-world networks validate the effectiveness and scalability of JOENA, achieving up to 16% improvement in MRR and 20x speedup compared with the state-of-the-art alignment methods.</p>

                  <p>LiDAR registration is a fundamental task in robotic mapping and localization.A critical component of aligning two point clouds is identifying robust point correspondences using point descriptors.This step becomes particularly challenging in scenarios involving domain shifts, seasonal changes, and variations in point cloud structures.These factors substantially impact both handcrafted and learning-based approaches.In this paper, we address these problems by proposing to use DINOv2 features, obtained from surround-view images, as point descriptors.We demonstrate that coupling these descriptors with traditional registration algorithms, such as RANSAC or ICP, facilitates robust 6DoF alignment of LiDAR scans with 3D maps, even when the map was recorded more than a year before.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Although conceptually straightforward, our method substantially outperforms more complex baseline techniques. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.701</span></span>In contrast to previous learning-based point descriptors, our method does not require domain-specific retraining and is agnostic to the point cloud structure, effectively handling both sparse LiDAR scans and dense 3D maps.We show that leveraging the additional camera data enables our method to outperform the best baseline by +24.8 and +17.3 registration recall on the NCLT and Oxford RobotCar datasets.We publicly release the registration benchmark and the code of our work on https://vfm-registration.cs.uni-freiburg.de.</p>

                  <p>Training dense LLMs requires enormous amounts of data and centralized compute, which introduces fundamental bottlenecks and ever-growing costs for large models.Several studies aim to reduce this dependency on centralization by reducing the communication overhead of training dense models.Taking this idea of reducing communication overhead to a natural extreme, by training embarrassingly parallelizable ensembles of small independent experts, has been shown to outperform large dense models trained in traditional centralized settings.However, existing studies do not take into account underlying differences amongst data domains and treat them as monolithic, regardless of their underlying complexity, size, or distribution.In this paper, we explore the effects of introducing heterogeneity to these ensembles of domain expert models.Specifically, by allowing models within the ensemble to vary in size--as well as the number of training steps taken depending on the training data's domain--we study the effect heterogeneity has on these ensembles when evaluated against domains included in, and excluded from, the training set.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We use the same compute budget to train heterogeneous ensembles and homogeneous baselines for comparison. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.653</span></span>We show that the heterogeneous ensembles achieve the lowest perplexity scores in $20$ out of the $21$ data domains used in the evaluation.Our code is available at https://github.com/gensyn-ai/hdee.</p>

                  <p>Existing LLM-based agents have achieved strong performance on held-in tasks, but their generalizability to unseen tasks remains poor.Hence, some recent work focus on fine-tuning the policy model with more diverse tasks to improve the generalizability.In this work, we find that finetuning a reward model to guide the policy model is more robust than directly finetuning the policy model.Based on this finding, we propose AgentRM, a generalizable reward model, to guide the policy model for effective test-time search.We comprehensively investigate three approaches to construct the reward model, including explicit reward modeling, implicit reward modeling and LLM-as-a-judge.We then use AgentRM to guide the answer generation with Best-of-N sampling and step-level beam search.On four types of nine agent tasks, AgentRM enhances the base policy model by $8.8$ points on average, surpassing the top general agent by $4.0$. Moreover, it demonstrates weak-to-strong generalization, yielding greater improvement of $12.6$ on LLaMA-3-70B policy model.As for the specializability, AgentRM can also boost a finetuned policy model and outperform the top specialized agent by $11.4$ on three held-in tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Further analysis verifies its effectiveness in test-time scaling. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.684</span></span>Codes will be released to facilitate the research in this area.</p>

                  <p>The rise of AI-driven coding assistants signals a fundamental shift in how software is built.While AI coding assistants have been integrated into existing Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), their full potential remains largely untapped.A key challenge is that these AI assistants can suffer from hallucinations, leading developers down decision paths that the AI should not dictate, sometimes even without the users awareness or consent.Moreover, current static-file IDEs lack the mechanisms to address critical issues such as tracking the provenance of AI-generated code and integrating version control in a way that aligns with the dynamic nature of AI-assisted development.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>As a result, developers are left without the necessary tools to manage, refine, and validate AI generated code systematically, making it difficult to ensure correctness, maintainability, and trust in the development process. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.654</span></span>Existing IDEs treat AI-generated code as static text, offering limited support for managing its evolution, refinement, or multiple alternative paths.   Drawing inspiration from the ancient art of Japanese Bonsai gardening focused on balance, structure, and deliberate pruning: we propose a new approach to IDEs, where AI is allowed to generate in its true, unconstrained form, free from traditional file structures.This approach fosters a more fluid and interactive method for code evolution.We introduce the concept of a Bonsai-inspired IDE, structured as a graph of generated code snippets and multiple code paths, enabling developers to reshape AI generated code to suit their needs.Our vision calls for a shift away from a static file based model toward a dynamic, evolving system that allows for continuous refinement of generated code, with the IDE evolving alongside AI powered modifications rather than merely serving as a place to write and edit code.</p>
