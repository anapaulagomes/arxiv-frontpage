                  <p>Multimodal embedding models have gained significant attention for their ability to map data from different modalities, such as text and images, into a unified representation space.However, the limited labeled multimodal data often hinders embedding performance.Recent approaches have leveraged data synthesis to address this problem, yet the quality of synthetic data remains a critical bottleneck.In this work, we identify three criteria for high-quality synthetic multimodal data.First, broad scope ensures that the generated data covers diverse tasks and modalities, making it applicable to various downstream scenarios.Second, robust cross-modal alignment makes different modalities semantically consistent.Third, high fidelity ensures that the synthetic data maintains realistic details to enhance its reliability.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Guided by these principles, we synthesize datasets that: (1) cover a wide range of tasks, modality combinations, and languages, (2) are generated via a deep thinking process within a single pass of a multimodal large language model, and (3) incorporate real-world images with accurate and relevant texts, ensuring fidelity through self-evaluation and refinement. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.754</span></span>Leveraging these high-quality synthetic and labeled datasets, we train a multimodal multilingual E5 model mmE5.Extensive experiments demonstrate that mmE5 achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MMEB Benchmark and superior multilingual performance on the XTD benchmark.Our codes, datasets and models are released in https://github.com/haon-chen/mmE5.</p>

                  <p>Video Moment Retrieval is a common task to evaluate the performance of visual-language models - it involves localising start and end times of moments in videos from query sentences.The current task formulation assumes that the queried moment is present in the video, resulting in false positive moment predictions when irrelevant query sentences are provided.   In this paper we propose the task of Negative-Aware Video Moment Retrieval (NA-VMR), which considers both moment retrieval accuracy and negative query rejection accuracy.We make the distinction between In-Domain and Out-of-Domain negative queries and provide new evaluation benchmarks for two popular video moment retrieval datasets: QVHighlights and Charades-STA.We analyse the ability of current SOTA video moment retrieval approaches to adapt to Negative-Aware Video Moment Retrieval and propose UniVTG-NA, an adaptation of UniVTG designed to tackle NA-VMR.UniVTG-NA achieves high negative rejection accuracy (avg.$98.4\%$) scores while retaining moment retrieval scores to within $3.87\%$ Recall@1.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Dataset splits and code are available at https://github.com/keflanagan/MomentofUntruth <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.774</span></span></p>

                  <p>We present MatSwap, a method to transfer materials to designated surfaces in an image photorealistically.Such a task is non-trivial due to the large entanglement of material appearance, geometry, and lighting in a photograph.In the literature, material editing methods typically rely on either cumbersome text engineering or extensive manual annotations requiring artist knowledge and 3D scene properties that are impractical to obtain.In contrast, we propose to directly learn the relationship between the input material -- as observed on a flat surface -- and its appearance within the scene, without the need for explicit UV mapping.To achieve this, we rely on a custom light- and geometry-aware diffusion model.We fine-tune a large-scale pre-trained text-to-image model for material transfer using our synthetic dataset, preserving its strong priors to ensure effective generalization to real images.As a result, our method seamlessly integrates a desired material into the target location in the photograph while retaining the identity of the scene.We evaluate our method on synthetic and real images and show that it compares favorably to recent work both qualitatively and quantitatively.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We will release our code and data upon publication. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.773</span></span></p>

                  <p>Self-driving cars relying solely on ego-centric perception face limitations in sensing, often failing to detect occluded, faraway objects.Collaborative autonomous driving (CAV) seems like a promising direction, but collecting data for development is non-trivial.It requires placing multiple sensor-equipped agents in a real-world driving scene, simultaneously!<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>As such, existing datasets are limited in locations and agents. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.758</span></span>We introduce a novel surrogate to the rescue, which is to generate realistic perception from different viewpoints in a driving scene, conditioned on a real-world sample - the ego-car's sensory data.This surrogate has huge potential: it could potentially turn any ego-car dataset into a collaborative driving one to scale up the development of CAV.We present the very first solution, using a combination of simulated collaborative data and real ego-car data.Our method, Transfer Your Perspective (TYP), learns a conditioned diffusion model whose output samples are not only realistic but also consistent in both semantics and layouts with the given ego-car data.Empirical results demonstrate TYP's effectiveness in aiding in a CAV setting.In particular, TYP enables us to (pre-)train collaborative perception algorithms like early and late fusion with little or no real-world collaborative data, greatly facilitating downstream CAV applications.</p>

                  <p>Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is a key technique for improving conditional generation in diffusion models, enabling more accurate control while enhancing sample quality.It is natural to extend this technique to video diffusion, which generates video conditioned on a variable number of context frames, collectively referred to as history.However, we find two key challenges to guiding with variable-length history: architectures that only support fixed-size conditioning, and the empirical observation that CFG-style history dropout performs poorly.To address this, we propose the Diffusion Forcing Transformer (DFoT), a video diffusion architecture and theoretically grounded training objective that jointly enable conditioning on a flexible number of history frames.We then introduce History Guidance, a family of guidance methods uniquely enabled by DFoT.We show that its simplest form, vanilla history guidance, already significantly improves video generation quality and temporal consistency.A more advanced method, history guidance across time and frequency further enhances motion dynamics, enables compositional generalization to out-of-distribution history, and can stably roll out extremely long videos.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Website: https://boyuan.space/history-guidance <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.755</span></span></p>

                  <p>The login functionality, being the gateway to app usage, plays a critical role in both user experience and application security.As Android apps increasingly incorporate login functionalities, they support a variety of authentication methods with complicated login processes, catering to personalized user experiences.However, the complexities in managing different operations in login processes make it difficult for developers to handle them correctly.In this paper, we present the first empirical study of login issues in Android apps.We analyze 361 issues from 44 popular open-source Android repositories, examining the root causes, symptoms, and trigger conditions of these issues.Our findings indicate that the vast majority of the login issues are induced by the improper handling of complex state transitions during the login process, which can prevent users from logging in or misdirect them to incorrect subsequent actions.Additionally, we observed that issues related to this cause typically require the convergence of multiple trigger conditions to manifest.These findings can help developers to model the login processes which can help them to identify the causes of issues and design targeted test cases and precise test oracles.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our dataset has been made openly available to facilitate future research in this area. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.852</span></span></p>

                  <p>Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is crucial for automotive design, requiring the analysis of large 3D point clouds to study how vehicle geometry affects pressure fields and drag forces.However, existing deep learning approaches for CFD struggle with the computational complexity of processing high-resolution 3D data.We propose Factorized Implicit Global Convolution (FIGConv), a novel architecture that efficiently solves CFD problems for very large 3D meshes with arbitrary input and output geometries.FIGConv achieves quadratic complexity $O(N^2)$, a significant improvement over existing 3D neural CFD models that require cubic complexity $O(N^3)$. Our approach combines Factorized Implicit Grids to approximate high-resolution domains, efficient global convolutions through 2D reparameterization, and a U-shaped architecture for effective information gathering and integration.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We validate our approach on the industry-standard Ahmed body dataset and the large-scale DrivAerNet dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.767</span></span>In DrivAerNet, our model achieves an $R^2$ value of 0.95 for drag prediction, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art by a significant margin.This represents a 40% improvement in relative mean squared error and a 70% improvement in absolute mean squared error over previous methods.</p>

To address these challenges, we propose a curation pipeline designed to enhance the quality of the largest publicly available code review dataset.We begin by establishing an evaluation framework, incorporating specific criteria and categories to empirically study the initial quality of the dataset.Using a large language model (LLM)-driven approach, we then apply our curation pipeline to refine the dataset.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A comparative analysis of the newly curated dataset, based on the same evaluation framework, demonstrates substantial improvements in the clarity and conciseness of the comments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.819</span></span>Additionally, we assess the impact of the curated dataset on automating downstream tasks, specifically comment generation and code refinement.Our findings show that the curated dataset leads to enhanced model performance in generating more accurate comments.Curated comments are also more useful as they lead to more accurate code refinement.</p>

                  <p>Medical image segmentation is a crucial task in medical image analysis, but it can be very challenging especially when there are less labeled data but with large unlabeled data.Contrastive learning has proven to be effective for medical image segmentation in semi-supervised learning by constructing contrastive samples from partial pixels.However, although previous contrastive learning methods can mine semantic information from partial pixels within images, they ignore the whole context information of unlabeled images, which is very important to precise segmentation.In order to solve this problem, we propose a novel prototype contrastive learning method called Prototype Contrastive Consistency Segmentation (PCCS) for semi-supervised medical image segmentation.The core idea is to enforce the prototypes of the same semantic class to be closer and push the prototypes in different semantic classes far away from each other.Specifically, we construct a signed distance map and an uncertainty map from unlabeled images.The signed distance map is used to construct prototypes for contrastive learning, and then we estimate the prototype uncertainty from the uncertainty map as trade-off among prototypes.In order to obtain better prototypes, based on the student-teacher architecture, a new mechanism named prototype updating prototype is designed to assist in updating the prototypes for contrastive learning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, we propose an uncertainty-consistency loss to mine more reliable information from unlabeled data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.617</span></span>Extensive experiments on medical image segmentation demonstrate that PCCS achieves better segmentation performance than the state-of-the-art methods.The code is available at https://github.com/comphsh/PCCS.</p>

                  <p>Referring Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (RRSIS) is critical for ecological monitoring, urban planning, and disaster management, requiring precise segmentation of objects in remote sensing imagery guided by textual descriptions.This task is uniquely challenging due to the considerable vision-language gap, the high spatial resolution and broad coverage of remote sensing imagery with diverse categories and small targets, and the presence of clustered, unclear targets with blurred edges.To tackle these issues, we propose \ours, a novel framework designed to bridge the vision-language gap, enhance multi-scale feature interaction, and improve fine-grained object differentiation.Specifically, \ours introduces: (1) the Bidirectional Spatial Correlation (BSC) for improved vision-language feature alignment, (2) the Target-Background TwinStream Decoder (T-BTD) for precise distinction between targets and non-targets, and (3) the Dual-Modal Object Learning Strategy (D-MOLS) for robust multimodal feature reconstruction.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets RefSegRS and RRSIS-D demonstrate that \ours achieves state-of-the-art performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.611</span></span>Specifically, \ours improves the overall IoU (oIoU) by 3.76 percentage points (80.57) and 1.44 percentage points (79.23) on the two datasets, respectively.Additionally, it outperforms previous methods in the mean IoU (mIoU) by 5.37 percentage points (67.95) and 1.84 percentage points (66.04), effectively addressing the core challenges of RRSIS with enhanced precision and robustness.</p>

We model the sorting problem as a query-limited tournament graph where edges involving erroneous nodes may yield arbitrary results.Our primary contribution is a randomized algorithm inspired by quick-sort that, in expectation, produces an ordering close to the true total order while only querying $\tilde{O}(n)$ edges.We achieve a distance from the target order $\pi$ within $(3 + \epsilon)|B|$, where $B$ is the set of erroneous nodes, balancing the competing objectives of minimizing both query complexity and misalignment with $\pi$. Our algorithm needs to carefully balance two aspects: identify a pivot that partitions the vertex set evenly and ensure that this partition is "truthful" and yet query as few "triangles" in the graph $G$ as possible.Since the nodes in $B$ can potentially hide in an intricate manner, our algorithm requires several technical steps.   Additionally, we demonstrate significant implications for the Ulam-$k$-Median problem, a classical clustering problem where the metric is defined on the set of permutations on a set of $d$ elements.Chakraborty, Das, and Krauthgamer gave a $(2-\varepsilon)$ FPT approximation algorithm for this problem, where the running time is super-linear in both $n$ and $d$. We use our robust sorting framework to give the first $(2-\varepsilon)$ FPT linear time approximation algorithm for this problem.</p>

Our analysis provides improvements over previous bounds, particularly when the spectrum of $M$ satisfies natural structural assumptions.The novel insight is to view the addition of Gaussian noise to a matrix as a continuous-time matrix Brownian motion.This viewpoint allows us to track the evolution of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix, which are governed by stochastic differential equations discovered by Dyson.These equations enable us to upper bound the Frobenius distance between the best rank-$k$ approximation of $M$ and that of a Gaussian perturbation of $M$ as an integral that involves inverse eigenvalue gaps of the stochastically evolving matrix, as opposed to a sum of perturbation bounds obtained via Davis-Kahan-type theorems.Subsequently, again using the Dyson Brownian motion viewpoint, we show that the eigenvalues of the matrix $M$ perturbed by Gaussian noise have large gaps with high probability.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These results also contribute to the analysis of low-rank approximations under average-case perturbations, and to an understanding of eigenvalue gaps for random matrices, both of which may be of independent interest. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.61</span></span></p>

CHIRLA consists of recordings from strategically placed cameras over a seven-month period, capturing significant variations in both temporal and appearance attributes, including controlled changes in participants' clothing and physical features.The dataset includes 22 individuals, four connected indoor environments, and seven cameras.We collected more than five hours of video that we semi-automatically labeled to generate around one million bounding boxes with identity annotations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By introducing this comprehensive benchmark, we aim to facilitate the development and evaluation of Re-ID algorithms that can reliably perform in challenging, long-term real-world scenarios. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.638</span></span></p>

                  <p>Purpose: Earth system models (ESMs) integrate the interactions of the atmosphere, ocean, land, ice, and biosphere to estimate the state of regional and global climate under a wide variety of conditions.The ESMs are highly complex, and thus, deep neural network architectures are used to model the complexity and store the down-sampled data.In this paper, we propose the Vision Transformer Sinusoidal Representation Networks (ViSIR) to improve the single image SR (SR) reconstruction task for the ESM data.   Methods: ViSIR combines the SR capability of Vision Transformers (ViT) with the high-frequency detail preservation of the Sinusoidal Representation Network (SIREN) to address the spectral bias observed in SR tasks.   Results:The ViSIR outperforms ViT by 4.1 dB, SIREN by 7.5 dB, and SR-Generative Adversarial (SR-GANs) by 7.1dB PSNR on average for three different measurements.   Conclusion: The proposed ViSIR is evaluated and compared with state-of-the-art methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results show that the proposed algorithm is outperforming other methods in terms of Mean Square Error(MSE), Peak-Signal-to-Noise-Ratio(PSNR), and Structural Similarity Index Measure(SSIM). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.72</span></span></p>

                  <p>Randomized experiments are the preferred approach for evaluating the effects of interventions, but they are costly and often yield estimates with substantial uncertainty.On the other hand, in silico experiments leveraging foundation models offer a cost-effective alternative that can potentially attain higher statistical precision.However, the benefits of in silico experiments come with a significant risk: statistical inferences are not valid if the models fail to accurately predict experimental responses to interventions.In this paper, we propose a novel approach that integrates the predictions from multiple foundation models with experimental data while preserving valid statistical inference.Our estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal, with asymptotic variance no larger than the standard estimator based on experimental data alone.Importantly, these statistical properties hold even when model predictions are arbitrarily biased.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Empirical results across several randomized experiments show that our estimator offers substantial precision gains, equivalent to a reduction of up to 20% in the sample size needed to match the same precision as the standard estimator based on experimental data alone. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.664</span></span></p>

                  <p>While deep learning (DL) has permeated, and become an integral component of many critical software systems, today software engineering research hasn't explored how to separately test data and models that are integral for DL approaches to work effectively.The main challenge in independently testing these components arises from the tight dependency between data and models.This research explores this gap, introducing our methodology of mock deep testing for unit testing of DL applications.To enable unit testing, we introduce a design paradigm that decomposes the workflow into distinct, manageable components, minimizes sequential dependencies, and modularizes key stages of the DL.For unit testing these components, we propose modeling their dependencies using mocks.This modular approach facilitates independent development and testing of the components, ensuring comprehensive quality assurance throughout the development process.We have developed KUnit, a framework for enabling mock deep testing for the Keras library.We empirically evaluated KUnit to determine the effectiveness of mocks.Our assessment of 50 DL programs obtained from Stack Overflow and GitHub shows that mocks effectively identified 10 issues in the data preparation stage and 53 issues in the model design stage.We also conducted a user study with 36 participants using KUnit to perceive the effectiveness of our approach.Participants using KUnit successfully resolved 25 issues in the data preparation stage and 38 issues in the model design stage.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings highlight that mock objects provide a lightweight emulation of the dependencies for unit testing, facilitating early bug detection. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>Lastly, to evaluate the usability of KUnit, we conducted a post-study survey.The results reveal that KUnit is helpful to DL application developers, enabling them to independently test each component effectively in different stages.</p>

To more effectively tackle the problem of S2R quality annotation, we propose a new technique called AstroBR, which leverages the language understanding capabilities of LLMs to identify and extract the S2Rs from bug reports and map them to GUI interactions in a program state model derived via dynamic analysis.We compared AstroBR to a related state-of-the-art approach and we found that AstroBR annotates S2Rs 25.2% better (in terms of F1 score) than the baseline.Additionally, AstroBR suggests more accurate missing S2Rs than the baseline (by 71.4% in terms of F1 score).</p>

To address these challenges, we propose a curation pipeline designed to enhance the quality of the largest publicly available code review dataset.We begin by establishing an evaluation framework, incorporating specific criteria and categories to empirically study the initial quality of the dataset.Using a large language model (LLM)-driven approach, we then apply our curation pipeline to refine the dataset.A comparative analysis of the newly curated dataset, based on the same evaluation framework, demonstrates substantial improvements in the clarity and conciseness of the comments.Additionally, we assess the impact of the curated dataset on automating downstream tasks, specifically comment generation and code refinement.Our findings show that the curated dataset leads to enhanced model performance in generating more accurate comments.Curated comments are also more useful as they lead to more accurate code refinement.</p>

                  <p>The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 with Extended Reality (XR) technologies offers the potential to build truly immersive XR environments that interact with human users through natural language, e.g., generating and animating 3D scenes from audio inputs.However, the complexity of XR environments makes it difficult to accurately extract relevant contextual data and scene/object parameters from an overwhelming volume of XR artifacts.It leads to not only increased costs with pay-per-use models, but also elevated levels of generation errors.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, existing approaches focusing on coding script generation are often prone to generation errors, resulting in flawed or invalid scripts, application crashes, and ultimately a degraded user experience. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.64</span></span>To overcome these challenges, we introduce LLMER, a novel framework that creates interactive XR worlds using JSON data generated by LLMs.Unlike prior approaches focusing on coding script generation, LLMER translates natural language inputs into JSON data, significantly reducing the likelihood of application crashes and processing latency.It employs a multi-stage strategy to supply only the essential contextual information adapted to the user's request and features multiple modules designed for various XR tasks.Our preliminary user study reveals the effectiveness of the proposed system, with over 80% reduction in consumed tokens and around 60% reduction in task completion time compared to state-of-the-art approaches.The analysis of users' feedback also illuminates a series of directions for further optimization.</p>
