                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in various NLP tasks, yet they still face significant challenges in reasoning and arithmetic.Temporal reasoning, a critical component of natural language understanding, has raised increasing research attention.However, comprehensive testing of Allen's interval relations (e.g., before, after, during) -- a fundamental framework for temporal relationships -- remains underexplored.To fill this gap, we present ChronoSense, a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs' temporal understanding.It includes 16 tasks, focusing on identifying the Allen relation between two temporal events and temporal arithmetic, using both abstract events and real-world data from Wikidata.We assess the performance of seven recent LLMs using this benchmark and the results indicate that models handle Allen relations, even symmetrical ones, quite differently.Moreover, the findings suggest that the models may rely on memorization to answer time-related questions.Overall, the models' low performance highlights the need for improved temporal understanding in LLMs and ChronoSense offers a robust framework for future research in this area.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our dataset and the source code are available at https://github.com/duyguislakoglu/chronosense. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.863</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in various NLP tasks, including semantic parsing, which trans lates natural language into formal code representations.However, the reverse process, translating code into natural language, termed semantic captioning, has received less attention.This task is becoming increasingly important as LLMs are integrated into platforms for code generation, security analysis, and educational purposes.In this paper, we focus on the captioning of SQL query (SQL2Text) to address the critical need for understanding and explaining SQL queries in an era where LLM-generated code poses potential security risks.We repurpose Text2SQL datasets for SQL2Text by introducing an iterative ICL prompt using GPT-4o to generate multiple additional utterances, which enhances the robustness of the datasets for the reverse task.We conduct our experiments using in-context learning (ICL) based on different sample selection methods, emphasizing smaller, more computationally efficient LLMs.Our findings demonstrate that leveraging the inherent graph properties of SQL for ICL sample selection significantly outperforms random selection by up to 39% on BLEU score and provides better results than alternative methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Dataset and codes are published: \url{https://github.com/aliwister/ast-icl}. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.837</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent 3D content generation pipelines commonly employ Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to encode shapes into compact latent representations for diffusion-based generation.However, the widely adopted uniform point sampling strategy in Shape VAE training often leads to a significant loss of geometric details, limiting the quality of shape reconstruction and downstream generation tasks.We present Dora-VAE, a novel approach that enhances VAE reconstruction through our proposed sharp edge sampling strategy and a dual cross-attention mechanism.By identifying and prioritizing regions with high geometric complexity during training, our method significantly improves the preservation of fine-grained shape features.Such sampling strategy and the dual attention mechanism enable the VAE to focus on crucial geometric details that are typically missed by uniform sampling approaches.To systematically evaluate VAE reconstruction quality, we additionally propose Dora-bench, a benchmark that quantifies shape complexity through the density of sharp edges, introducing a new metric focused on reconstruction accuracy at these salient geometric features.Extensive experiments on the Dora-bench demonstrate that Dora-VAE achieves comparable reconstruction quality to the state-of-the-art dense XCube-VAE while requiring a latent space at least 8$\times$ smaller (1,280 vs. > 10,000 codes).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We will release our code and benchmark dataset to facilitate future research in 3D shape modeling. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.731</span></span></p>

To address this gap, GIRAFE is a data repository designed to facilitate the development of advanced techniques for the semantic segmentation, analysis, and fast evaluation of High-Speed videoendoscopic sequences of the vocal folds.The repository includes 65 high-speed videoendoscopic recordings from a cohort of 50 patients (30 female, 20 male).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset comprises 15 recordings from healthy controls, 26 from patients with diagnosed voice disorders, and 24 with an unknown health condition. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.91</span></span>All of them were manually annotated by an expert, including the masks corresponding to the semantic segmentation of the glottal gap.The repository is also complemented with the automatic segmentation of the glottal area using different state-of-the-art approaches.

                  <p>The suite of datasets commonly used to train and evaluate the mathematical capabilities of AI-based mathematical copilots (primarily large language models) exhibit several shortcomings.These limitations include a restricted scope of mathematical complexity, typically not exceeding lower undergraduate-level mathematics, binary rating protocols and other issues, which makes comprehensive proof-based evaluation suites difficult.We systematically explore these limitations and contend that enhancing the capabilities of large language models, or any forthcoming advancements in AI-based mathematical assistants (copilots or "thought partners"), necessitates a paradigm shift in the design of mathematical datasets and the evaluation criteria of mathematical ability: It is necessary to move away from result-based datasets (theorem statement to theorem proof) and convert the rich facets of mathematical research practice to data LLMs can train on.Examples of these are mathematical workflows (sequences of atomic, potentially subfield-dependent tasks that are often performed when creating new mathematics), which are an important part of the proof-discovery process.Additionally, we advocate for mathematical dataset developers to consider the concept of "motivated proof", introduced by G. P\'olya in 1949, which can serve as a blueprint for datasets that offer a better proof learning signal, alleviating some of the mentioned limitations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Lastly, we introduce math datasheets for datasets, extending the general, dataset-agnostic variants of datasheets: We provide a questionnaire designed specifically for math datasets that we urge dataset creators to include with their datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.772</span></span>This will make creators aware of potential limitations of their datasets while at the same time making it easy for readers to assess it from the point of view of training and evaluating mathematical copilots.</p>

                  <p>Domain Generalization (DG) seeks to transfer knowledge from multiple source domains to unseen target domains, even in the presence of domain shifts.Achieving effective generalization typically requires a large and diverse set of labeled source data to learn robust representations that can generalize to new, unseen domains.However, obtaining such high-quality labeled data is often costly and labor-intensive, limiting the practical applicability of DG.To address this, we investigate a more practical and challenging problem: semi-supervised domain generalization (SSDG) under a label-efficient paradigm.In this paper, we propose a novel method, CAT, which leverages semi-supervised learning with limited labeled data to achieve competitive generalization performance under domain shifts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our method addresses key limitations of previous approaches, such as reliance on fixed thresholds and sensitivity to noisy pseudo-labels. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>CAT combines adaptive thresholding with noisy label refinement techniques, creating a straightforward yet highly effective solution for SSDG tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, our approach uses flexible thresholding to generate high-quality pseudo-labels with higher class diversity while refining noisy pseudo-labels to improve their reliability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.679</span></span>Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method, highlighting its effectiveness in achieving robust generalization under domain shift.</p>

                  <p>Model inversion attacks pose a significant privacy threat to machine learning models by reconstructing sensitive data from their outputs.While various defenses have been proposed to counteract these attacks, they often come at the cost of the classifier's utility, thus creating a challenging trade-off between privacy protection and model utility.Moreover, most existing defenses require retraining the classifier for enhanced robustness, which is impractical for large-scale, well-established models.This paper introduces a novel defense mechanism to better balance privacy and utility, particularly against adversaries who employ a machine learning model (i.e., inversion model) to reconstruct private data.Drawing inspiration from data poisoning attacks, which can compromise the performance of machine learning models, we propose a strategy that leverages data poisoning to contaminate the training data of inversion models, thereby preventing model inversion attacks.   Two defense methods are presented.The first, termed label-preserving poisoning attacks for all output vectors (LPA), involves subtle perturbations to all output vectors while preserving their labels.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings demonstrate that these minor perturbations, introduced through a data poisoning approach, significantly increase the difficulty of data reconstruction without compromising the utility of the classifier. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>Subsequently, we introduce a second method, label-flipping poisoning for partial output vectors (LFP), which selectively perturbs a small subset of output vectors and alters their labels during the process.Empirical results indicate that LPA is notably effective, outperforming the current state-of-the-art defenses.Our data poisoning-based defense provides a new retraining-free defense paradigm that preserves the victim classifier's utility.</p>

                  <p>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cardiac dyssynchrony are major public health problems in the United States.Precise cardiac image segmentation is crucial for extracting quantitative measures that help categorize cardiac dyssynchrony.However, achieving high accuracy often depends on centralizing large datasets from different hospitals, which can be challenging due to privacy concerns.To solve this problem, Federated Learning (FL) is proposed to enable decentralized model training on such data without exchanging sensitive information.However, bandwidth limitations and data heterogeneity remain as significant challenges in conventional FL algorithms.In this paper, we propose a novel efficient and adaptive federate learning method for cardiac segmentation that improves model performance while reducing the bandwidth requirement.Our method leverages the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to regularize model weight update and reduce communication overhead.We also propose a \mymethod{} aggregation technique to address data heterogeneity among clients.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This technique adaptively penalizes the aggregated weights from different clients by comparing the validation accuracy in each client, allowing better generalization performance and fast local adaptation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.661</span></span>In-client and cross-client evaluations on public cardiac MR datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over other LoRA-based federate learning approaches.</p>

To this end, this paper introduces the first AutOmated Robustness Testing frAmework, AORTA, which reconceptualizes the testing process into a combinatorial optimization problem.Existing testing methods designed for DNN-based software can be applied to LLM-based software by AORTA, but their effectiveness is limited.To address this, we propose a novel testing method for LLM-based software within AORTA called Adaptive Beam Search.ABS is tailored for the expansive feature space of LLMs and improves testing effectiveness through an adaptive beam width and the capability for backtracking.   We successfully embed 18 test methods in the designed framework AORTA and compared the test validity of ABS with three datasets and five threat models.ABS facilitates a more comprehensive and accurate robustness assessment before software deployment, with an average test success rate of 86.138%.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Compared to the currently best-performing baseline PWWS, ABS significantly reduces the computational overhead by up to 3441.895 seconds per successful test case and decreases the number of queries by 218.762 times on average. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span>Furthermore, test cases generated by ABS exhibit greater naturalness and transferability.</p>

Our algorithms certify a bound which is asymptotically smaller than the naive one, given by the maximum singular value of $M$, for nearly the widest-possible range of $n,d,$ and $\eta$. Efficiently certifying such a bound for a range of $n,d$ and $\eta$ which is larger by any polynomial factor than what is achieved by our algorithm would violate lower bounds in the SQ and low-degree polynomials models.Our certification algorithm makes essential use of the Sum-of-Squares hierarchy.To prove the correctness of our algorithm, we develop a new combinatorial connection between the graph matrix approach to analyze random matrices with dependent entries, and the Efron-Stein decomposition of functions of independent random variables.   As applications of our certification algorithm, we obtain new efficient algorithms for a wide range of well-studied algorithmic tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In algorithmic robust statistics, we obtain new algorithms for robust mean and covariance estimation with tradeoffs between breakdown point and sample complexity, which are nearly matched by SQ and low-degree polynomial lower bounds (that we establish). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.609</span></span>We also obtain new polynomial-time guarantees for certification of $\ell_1/\ell_2$ distortion of random subspaces of $\mathbb{R}^n$ (also with nearly matching lower bounds), sparse principal component analysis, and certification of the $2\rightarrow p$ norm of a random matrix.</p>

                  <p>The core of the Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) task is to predict and complete the missing relations or nodes in a KG.Common KGC tasks are mostly about inferring unknown elements with one or two elements being known in a triple.In comparison, the Triple Set Prediction (TSP) task is a more realistic knowledge graph completion task.It aims to predict all elements of unknown triples based on the information from known triples.In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have exhibited significant advancements in language comprehension, demonstrating considerable potential for KGC tasks.However, the potential of LLM on the TSP task has not yet to be investigated.Thus in this paper we proposed a new framework to explore the strengths and limitations of LLM in the TSP task.Specifically, the framework consists of LLM-based rule mining and LLM-based triple set prediction.The relation list of KG embedded within rich semantic information is first leveraged to prompt LLM in the generation of rules.This process is both efficient and independent of statistical information, making it easier to mine effective and realistic rules.For each subgraph, the specified rule is applied in conjunction with the relevant triples within that subgraph to guide the LLM in predicting the missing triples.Subsequently, the predictions from all subgraphs are consolidated to derive the complete set of predicted triples on KG.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, the method is evaluated on the relatively complete CFamily dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span>The experimental results indicate that when LLMs are required to adhere to a large amount of factual knowledge to predict missing triples, significant hallucinations occurs, leading to a noticeable decline in performance.To further explore the causes of this phenomenon, this paper presents a comprehensive analysis supported by a detailed case study.</p>

                  <p>Association rules are an important technique for gaining insights over large relational datasets consisting of tuples of elements (i.e. attribute-value pairs).However, it is difficult to explain the relative importance of data elements with respect to the rules in which they appear.This paper develops a measure of an element's contribution to a set of association rules based on Shapley values, denoted SHARQ (ShApley Rules Quantification).As is the case with many Shapely-based computations, the cost of a naive calculation of the score is exponential in the number of elements.To that end, we present an efficient framework for computing the exact SharQ value of a single element whose running time is practically linear in the number of rules.Going one step further, we develop an efficient multi-element SHARQ algorithm which amortizes the cost of the single element SHARQ calculation over a set of elements.Based on the definition of SHARQ for elements we describe two additional use cases for association rules explainability: rule importance and attribute importance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments over a novel benchmark dataset containing 45 instances of mined rule sets show the effectiveness of our approach. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span></p>

                  <p>Traditional analyses of gradient descent optimization show that, when the largest eigenvalue of the loss Hessian - often referred to as the sharpness - is below a critical learning-rate threshold, then training is 'stable' and training loss decreases monotonically.Recent studies, however, have suggested that the majority of modern deep neural networks achieve good performance despite operating outside this stable regime.In this work, we demonstrate that such instabilities, induced by large learning rates, move model parameters toward flatter regions of the loss landscape.Our crucial insight lies in noting that, during these instabilities, the orientation of the Hessian eigenvectors rotate.This, we conjecture, allows the model to explore regions of the loss landscape that display more desirable geometrical properties for generalization, such as flatness.These rotations are a consequence of network depth, and we prove that for any network with depth > 1, unstable growth in parameters cause rotations in the principal components of the Hessian, which promote exploration of the parameter space away from unstable directions.Our empirical studies reveal an implicit regularization effect in gradient descent with large learning rates operating beyond the stability threshold.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We find these lead to excellent generalization performance on modern benchmark datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.669</span></span></p>

                  <p>In this paper, we reveal the intrinsic duality between graph neural networks (GNNs) and evolutionary algorithms (EAs), bridging two traditionally distinct fields.Building on this insight, we propose Graph Neural Evolution (GNE), a novel evolutionary algorithm that models individuals as nodes in a graph and leverages designed frequency-domain filters to balance global exploration and local exploitation.Through the use of these filters, GNE aggregates high-frequency (diversity-enhancing) and low-frequency (stability-promoting) information, transforming EAs into interpretable and tunable mechanisms in the frequency domain.Extensive experiments on benchmark functions demonstrate that GNE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms such as GA, DE, CMA-ES, SDAES, and RL-SHADE, excelling in complex landscapes, optimal solution shifts, and noisy environments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Its robustness, adaptability, and superior convergence highlight its practical and theoretical value. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.639</span></span>Beyond optimization, GNE establishes a conceptual and mathematical foundation linking EAs and GNNs, offering new perspectives for both fields.Its framework encourages the development of task-adaptive filters and hybrid approaches for EAs, while its insights can inspire advances in GNNs, such as improved global information propagation and mitigation of oversmoothing.GNE's versatility extends to solving challenges in machine learning, including hyperparameter tuning and neural architecture search, as well as real-world applications in engineering and operations research.By uniting the dynamics of EAs with the structural insights of GNNs, this work provides a foundation for interdisciplinary innovation, paving the way for scalable and interpretable solutions to complex optimization problems.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities across a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks.However, keeping these models up-to-date with evolving world knowledge remains a significant challenge due to the high costs of frequent retraining.To address this challenge, knowledge editing techniques have emerged to update LLMs with new information without rebuilding the model from scratch.Among these, the in-context editing paradigm stands out for its effectiveness in integrating new knowledge while preserving the model's original capabilities.Despite its potential, existing in-context knowledge editing methods are often task-specific, focusing primarily on multi-hop QA tasks using structured knowledge triples.Moreover, their reliance on few-shot prompting for task decomposition makes them unstable and less effective in generalizing across diverse tasks.   In response to these limitations, we propose EditCoT, a novel knowledge editing framework that flexibly and efficiently updates LLMs across various tasks without retraining.EditCoT works by generating a chain-of-thought (CoT) for a given input and then iteratively refining this CoT process using a CoT editor based on updated knowledge.We evaluate EditCoT across a diverse range of benchmarks, covering multiple languages and tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance while offering superior generalization, effectiveness, and stability compared to existing methods, marking a significant advancement in the field of knowledge updating. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.636</span></span>Code and data are available at: https://github.com/bebr2/EditCoT.</p>

                  <p>Learning a robust video Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is essential for reducing video redundancy and facilitating efficient video generation.Directly applying image VAEs to individual frames in isolation can result in temporal inconsistencies and suboptimal compression rates due to a lack of temporal compression.Existing Video VAEs have begun to address temporal compression; however, they often suffer from inadequate reconstruction performance.In this paper, we present a novel and powerful video autoencoder capable of high-fidelity video encoding.First, we observe that entangling spatial and temporal compression by merely extending the image VAE to a 3D VAE can introduce motion blur and detail distortion artifacts.Thus, we propose temporal-aware spatial compression to better encode and decode the spatial information.Additionally, we integrate a lightweight motion compression model for further temporal compression.Second, we propose to leverage the textual information inherent in text-to-video datasets and incorporate text guidance into our model.This significantly enhances reconstruction quality, particularly in terms of detail preservation and temporal stability.Third, we further improve the versatility of our model through joint training on both images and videos, which not only enhances reconstruction quality but also enables the model to perform both image and video autoencoding.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive evaluations against strong recent baselines demonstrate the superior performance of our method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.825</span></span>The project website can be found at~\href{https://yzxing87.github.io/vae/}{https://yzxing87.github.io/vae/}.</p>

                  <p>Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) enables operations on encrypted data, making it extremely useful for privacy-preserving applications, especially in cloud computing environments.In such contexts, operations like ranking, order statistics, and sorting are fundamental functionalities often required for database queries or as building blocks of larger protocols.However, the high computational overhead and limited native operations of FHE pose significant challenges for an efficient implementation of these tasks.These challenges are exacerbated by the fact that all these functionalities are based on comparing elements, which is a severely expensive operation under encryption.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Previous solutions have typically based their designs on swap-based techniques, where two elements are conditionally swapped based on the results of their comparison. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.611</span></span>These methods aim to reduce the primary computational bottleneck: the comparison depth, which is the number of non-parallelizable homomorphic comparisons.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The current state of the art solution for sorting by Lu et al.

                  <p>Mixture-of-Agents (MoA) has recently been proposed as a method to enhance performance of large language models (LLMs), enabling multiple individual LLMs to work together for collaborative inference.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This collaborative approach results in improved responses to user prompts compared to relying on a single LLM. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.684</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we consider such an MoA architecture in a distributed setting, where LLMs operate on individual edge devices, each uniquely associated with a user and equipped with its own distributed computing power. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.709</span></span>These devices exchange information using decentralized gossip algorithms, allowing different device nodes to talk without the supervision of a centralized server.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In the considered setup, different users have their own LLM models to address user prompts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.769</span></span>Additionally, the devices gossip either their own user-specific prompts or augmented prompts to generate more refined answers to certain queries.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>User prompts are temporarily stored in the device queues when their corresponding LLMs are busy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.687</span></span>Given the memory limitations of edge devices, it is crucial to ensure that the average queue sizes in the system remain bounded.In this paper, we address this by theoretically calculating the queuing stability conditions for the device queues under reasonable assumptions, which we validate experimentally as well.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Further, we demonstrate through experiments, leveraging open-source LLMs for the implementation of distributed MoA, that certain MoA configurations produce higher-quality responses compared to others, as evaluated on AlpacaEval 2.0 benchmark. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.66</span></span>The implementation is available at: https://github.com/purbeshmitra/distributed_moa.</p>

This study examines the impact of LLM-based automated code review tools in an industrial setting.The study was conducted within a software development environment that adopted an AI-assisted review tool (based on open-source Qodo PR Agent).Around 238 practitioners across ten projects had access to the tool.We focused on three projects with 4,335 pull requests, 1,568 of which underwent automated reviews.Data collection comprised three sources: (1) a quantitative analysis of pull request data, including comment labels indicating whether developers acted on the automated comments, (2) surveys sent to developers regarding their experience with reviews on individual pull requests, and (3) a broader survey of 22 practitioners capturing their general opinions on automated reviews.   73.8% of automated comments were resolved.However, the average pull request closure duration increased from five hours 52 minutes to eight hours 20 minutes, with varying trends across projects.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Most practitioners reported a minor improvement in code quality due to automated reviews.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.6</span></span>The LLM-based tool proved useful in software development, enhancing bug detection, increasing awareness of code quality, and promoting best practices.However, it also led to longer pull request closure times and introduced drawbacks like faulty reviews, unnecessary corrections, and irrelevant comments.</p>

                  <p>Recently, an increasing number of AI-driven programming assistants powered by code LLMs have been integrated into various real-world software development environments, significantly boosting developer productivity.However, existing code generation benchmarks primarily focus on general-purpose scenarios, leaving the code generation performance of LLMs for specific application domains largely unknown.In this paper, we introduce a new benchmark, MultiCodeBench, to fill this gap.MultiCodeBench comprises 2,400 programming tasks, covering 12 popular software development domains and 15 programming languages.Specifically, we perform in-depth research to identify these 12 application domains.Given that each domain may involve multiple technical frameworks, and that different frameworks present distinct challenges in the coding process, we categorize the commonly used frameworks and platforms within each domain.We then sample programming problems from GitHub repositories related to these subdomains.To ensure the quality of the tasks and mitigate data leakage issues, we invite annotators to rewrite the docstrings for each task in MultiCodeBench.Additionally, we build a static analysis-based dependency parsing tool to extract the dependencies in the ground truth for each task, enabling deeper performance analysis.Through extensive experiments on MultiCodeBench with eleven representative mainstream LLMs, we reveal the code generation performance of the LLMs across different application domains, providing practical insights for developers in downstream fields when selecting LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we analyze the reasons behind the models' failures in completing software application development tasks, offering guidance for model developers to enhance domain-specific code generation capabilities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span></p>
