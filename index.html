                  <p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate robust zero-shot capabilities across diverse vision-language tasks after training on mega-scale datasets.However, dense prediction tasks, such as semantic segmentation and keypoint detection, pose significant challenges for MLLMs when represented solely as text outputs.Simultaneously, current MLLMs utilizing latent embeddings for visual task decoding generally demonstrate limited adaptability to both multi-task learning and multi-granularity scenarios.In this work, we present REF-VLM, an end-to-end framework for unified training of various visual decoding tasks.To address complex visual decoding scenarios, we introduce the Triplet-Based Referring Paradigm (TRP), which explicitly decouples three critical dimensions in visual decoding tasks through a triplet structure: concepts, decoding types, and targets.TRP employs symbolic delimiters to enforce structured representation learning, enhancing the parsability and interpretability of model outputs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, we construct Visual-Task Instruction Following Dataset (VTInstruct), a large-scale multi-task dataset containing over 100 million multimodal dialogue samples across 25 task types. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.753</span></span>Beyond text inputs and outputs, VT-Instruct incorporates various visual prompts such as point, box, scribble, and mask, and generates outputs composed of text and visual units like box, keypoint, depth and mask.The combination of different visual prompts and visual units generates a wide variety of task types, expanding the applicability of REF-VLM significantly.Both qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our REF-VLM outperforms other MLLMs across a variety of standard benchmarks.The code, dataset, and demo available at https://github.com/MacavityT/REF-VLM.</p>

                  <p>Although large visual-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in multimodal tasks, errors may occasionally arise due to biases during the reasoning process.Recently, reward models (RMs) have become increasingly pivotal in the reasoning process.Specifically, process RMs evaluate each reasoning step, outcome RMs focus on the assessment of reasoning results, and critique RMs perform error analysis on the entire reasoning process, followed by corrections.However, existing benchmarks for vision-language RMs (VLRMs) typically assess only a single aspect of their capabilities (e.g., distinguishing between two answers), thus limiting the all-round evaluation and restricting the development of RMs in the visual-language domain.To address this gap, we propose a comprehensive and challenging benchmark, dubbed as VLRMBench, encompassing 12,634 questions.VLRMBench is constructed based on three distinct types of datasets, covering mathematical reasoning, hallucination understanding, and multi-image understanding.We design 12 tasks across three major categories, focusing on evaluating VLRMs in the aspects of process understanding, outcome judgment, and critique generation.Extensive experiments are conducted on 21 open-source models and 5 advanced closed-source models, highlighting the challenges posed by VLRMBench.For instance, in the `Forecasting Future', a binary classification task, the advanced GPT-4o achieves only a 76.0% accuracy.Additionally, we perform comprehensive analytical studies, offering valuable insights for the future development of VLRMs.We anticipate that VLRMBench will serve as a pivotal benchmark in advancing VLRMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code and datasets will be available at https://github.com/JCruan519/VLRMBench. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.852</span></span></p>

                  <p>Robust and accurate proprioceptive state estimation of the main body is crucial for legged robots to execute tasks in extreme environments where exteroceptive sensors, such as LiDARs and cameras may become unreliable.In this paper, we propose DogLegs, a state estimation system for legged robots that fuses the measurements from a body-mounted inertial measurement unit (Body-IMU), joint encoders, and multiple leg-mounted IMUs (Leg-IMU) using an extended Kalman filter (EKF).The filter system contains the error states of all IMU frames.The Leg-IMUs are used to detect foot contact, thereby providing zero velocity measurements to update the state of the Leg-IMU frames.Additionally, we compute the relative position constraints between the Body-IMU and Leg-IMUs by the leg kinematics and use them to update the main body state and reduce the error drift of the individual IMU frames.Field experimental results have shown that our proposed system can achieve better state estimation accuracy compared to the traditional leg odometry method (using only Body-IMU and joint encoders) across different terrains.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We make our datasets publicly available to benefit the research community. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.746</span></span></p>

                  <p>Remote Sensing Image Captioning (RSIC) is a cross-modal field bridging vision and language, aimed at automatically generating natural language descriptions of features and scenes in remote sensing imagery.Despite significant advances in developing sophisticated methods and large-scale datasets for training vision-language models (VLMs), two critical challenges persist: the scarcity of non-English descriptive datasets and the lack of multilingual capability evaluation for models.These limitations fundamentally impede the progress and practical deployment of RSIC, particularly in the era of large VLMs.To address these challenges, this paper presents several significant contributions to the field.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>First, we introduce and analyze BRSIC (Bilingual Remote Sensing Image Captioning), a comprehensive bilingual dataset that enriches three established English RSIC datasets with Chinese descriptions, encompassing 13,634 images paired with 68,170 bilingual captions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.852</span></span>Building upon this foundation, we develop a systematic evaluation framework that addresses the prevalent inconsistency in evaluation protocols, enabling rigorous assessment of model performance through standardized retraining procedures on BRSIC.Furthermore, we present an extensive empirical study of eight state-of-the-art large vision-language models (LVLMs), examining their capabilities across multiple paradigms including zero-shot inference, supervised fine-tuning, and multi-lingual training.This comprehensive evaluation provides crucial insights into the strengths and limitations of current LVLMs in handling multilingual remote sensing tasks.Additionally, our cross-dataset transfer experiments reveal interesting findings.The code and data will be available at https://github.com/mrazhou/BRSIC.</p>

                  <p>Response consistency-based, reference-free hallucination detection (RFHD) methods do not depend on internal model states, such as generation probabilities or gradients, which Grey-box models typically rely on but are inaccessible in closed-source LLMs.However, their inability to capture query-response alignment patterns often results in lower detection accuracy.Additionally, the lack of large-scale benchmark datasets spanning diverse domains remains a challenge, as most existing datasets are limited in size and scope.To this end, we propose HalluCounter, a novel reference-free hallucination detection method that utilizes both response-response and query-response consistency and alignment patterns.This enables the training of a classifier that detects hallucinations and provides a confidence score and an optimal response for user queries.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we introduce HalluCounterEval, a benchmark dataset comprising both synthetically generated and human-curated samples across multiple domains. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.758</span></span>Our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by a significant margin, achieving over 90\% average confidence in hallucination detection across datasets.</p>

                  <p>High-quality data resources play a crucial role in learning large language models (LLMs), particularly for low-resource languages like Cantonese.Despite having more than 85 million native speakers, Cantonese is still considered a low-resource language in the field of natural language processing (NLP) due to factors such as the dominance of Mandarin, lack of cohesion within the Cantonese-speaking community, diversity in character encoding and input methods, and the tendency of overseas Cantonese speakers to prefer using English.In addition, rich colloquial vocabulary of Cantonese, English loanwords, and code-switching characteristics add to the complexity of corpus collection and processing.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address these challenges, we collect Cantonese texts from a variety of sources, including open source corpora, Hong Kong-specific forums, Wikipedia, and Common Crawl data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.774</span></span>We conduct rigorous data processing through language filtering, quality filtering, content filtering, and de-duplication steps, successfully constructing a high-quality Cantonese corpus of over 2 billion tokens for training large language models.We further refined the model through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on curated Cantonese tasks, enhancing its ability to handle specific applications.Upon completion of the training, the model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on four Cantonese benchmarks.After training on our dataset, the model also exhibits improved performance on other mainstream language tasks.</p>

                  <p>The advancement of visual language models (VLMs) has enhanced mobile device operations, allowing simulated human-like actions to address user requirements.Current VLM-based mobile operating assistants can be structured into three levels: task, subtask, and action.The subtask level, linking high-level goals with low-level executable actions, is crucial for task completion but faces two challenges: ineffective subtasks that lower-level agent cannot execute and inefficient subtasks that fail to contribute to the completion of the higher-level task.These challenges stem from VLM's lack of experience in decomposing subtasks within GUI scenarios in multi-agent architecture.To address these, we propose a new mobile assistant architecture with constrained high-frequency o}ptimized planning (CHOP).Our approach overcomes the VLM's deficiency in GUI scenarios planning by using human-planned subtasks as the basis vector.We evaluate our architecture in both English and Chinese contexts across 20 Apps, demonstrating significant improvements in both effectiveness and efficiency.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our dataset and code is available at https://github.com/Yuqi-Zhou/CHOP <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.853</span></span></p>

                  <p>Research on egocentric tasks in computer vision has mostly focused on head-mounted cameras, such as fisheye cameras or embedded cameras inside immersive headsets.We argue that the increasing miniaturization of optical sensors will lead to the prolific integration of cameras into many more body-worn devices at various locations.This will bring fresh perspectives to established tasks in computer vision and benefit key areas such as human motion tracking, body pose estimation, or action recognition -- particularly for the lower body, which is typically occluded.   In this paper, we introduce EgoSim, a novel simulator of body-worn cameras that generates realistic egocentric renderings from multiple perspectives across a wearer's body.A key feature of EgoSim is its use of real motion capture data to render motion artifacts, which are especially noticeable with arm- or leg-worn cameras.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, we introduce MultiEgoView, a dataset of egocentric footage from six body-worn cameras and ground-truth full-body 3D poses during several activities: 119 hours of data are derived from AMASS motion sequences in four high-fidelity virtual environments, which we augment with 5 hours of real-world motion data from 13 participants using six GoPro cameras and 3D body pose references from an Xsens motion capture suit.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.833</span></span>We demonstrate EgoSim's effectiveness by training an end-to-end video-only 3D pose estimation network.Analyzing its domain gap, we show that our dataset and simulator substantially aid training for inference on real-world data.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>EgoSim code & MultiEgoView dataset: https://siplab.org/projects/EgoSim <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.836</span></span></p>

                  <p>Masked language modelling (MLM) as a pretraining objective has been widely adopted in genomic sequence modelling.While pretrained models can successfully serve as encoders for various downstream tasks, the distribution shift between pretraining and inference detrimentally impacts performance, as the pretraining task is to map [MASK] tokens to predictions, yet the [MASK] is absent during downstream applications.This means the encoder does not prioritize its encodings of non-[MASK] tokens, and expends parameters and compute on work only relevant to the MLM task, despite this being irrelevant at deployment time.In this work, we propose a modified encoder-decoder architecture based on the masked autoencoder framework, designed to address this inefficiency within a BERT-based transformer.We empirically show that the resulting mismatch is particularly detrimental in genomic pipelines where models are often used for feature extraction without fine-tuning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate our approach on the BIOSCAN-5M dataset, comprising over 2 million unique DNA barcodes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.727</span></span>We achieve substantial performance gains in both closed-world and open-world classification tasks when compared against causal models and bidirectional architectures pretrained with MLM tasks.</p>

                  <p>While cryptographic algorithms such as the ubiquitous Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) are secure, *physical implementations* of these algorithms in hardware inevitably 'leak' sensitive data such as cryptographic keys.A particularly insidious form of leakage arises from the fact that hardware consumes power and emits radiation in a manner that is statistically associated with the data it processes and the instructions it executes.Supervised deep learning has emerged as a state-of-the-art tool for carrying out *side-channel attacks*, which exploit this leakage by learning to map power/radiation measurements throughout encryption to the sensitive data operated on during that encryption.In this work we develop a principled deep learning framework for determining the relative leakage due to measurements recorded at different points in time, in order to inform *defense* against such attacks.This information is invaluable to cryptographic hardware designers for understanding *why* their hardware leaks and how they can mitigate it (e.g. by indicating the particular sections of code or electronic components which are responsible).Our framework is based on an adversarial game between a family of classifiers trained to estimate the conditional distributions of sensitive data given subsets of measurements, and a budget-constrained noise distribution which probabilistically erases individual measurements to maximize the loss of these classifiers.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We demonstrate our method's efficacy and ability to overcome limitations of prior work through extensive experimental comparison with 8 baseline methods using 3 evaluation metrics and 6 publicly-available power/EM trace datasets from AES, ECC and RSA implementations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.642</span></span>We provide an open-source PyTorch implementation of these experiments.</p>

                  <p>Enabling robots to learn novel tasks in a data-efficient manner is a long-standing challenge.Common strategies involve carefully leveraging prior experiences, especially transition data collected on related tasks.Although much progress has been made for general pick-and-place manipulation, far fewer studies have investigated contact-rich assembly tasks, where precise control is essential.We introduce SRSA (Skill Retrieval and Skill Adaptation), a novel framework designed to address this problem by utilizing a pre-existing skill library containing policies for diverse assembly tasks.The challenge lies in identifying which skill from the library is most relevant for fine-tuning on a new task.Our key hypothesis is that skills showing higher zero-shot success rates on a new task are better suited for rapid and effective fine-tuning on that task.To this end, we propose to predict the transfer success for all skills in the skill library on a novel task, and then use this prediction to guide the skill retrieval process.We establish a framework that jointly captures features of object geometry, physical dynamics, and expert actions to represent the tasks, allowing us to efficiently learn the transfer success predictor.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments demonstrate that SRSA significantly outperforms the leading baseline. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span>When retrieving and fine-tuning skills on unseen tasks, SRSA achieves a 19% relative improvement in success rate, exhibits 2.6x lower standard deviation across random seeds, and requires 2.4x fewer transition samples to reach a satisfactory success rate, compared to the baseline.Furthermore, policies trained with SRSA in simulation achieve a 90% mean success rate when deployed in the real world.Please visit our project webpage https://srsa2024.github.io/.</p>

                  <p>TSP is a classic and extensively studied problem with numerous real-world applications in artificial intelligence and operations research.It is well-known that TSP admits a constant approximation ratio on metric graphs but becomes NP-hard to approximate within any computable function $f(n)$ on general graphs.This disparity highlights a significant gap between the results on metric graphs and general graphs.Recent research has introduced some parameters to measure the ``distance'' of general graphs from being metric and explored FPT approximation algorithms parameterized by these parameters.Two commonly studied parameters are $p$, the number of vertices in triangles violating the triangle inequality, and $q$, the minimum number of vertices whose removal results in a metric graph.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we present improved FPT approximation algorithms with respect to these two parameters. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.65</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For $p$, we propose an FPT algorithm with a 1.5-approximation ratio, improving upon the previous ratio of 2.5. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.629</span></span>For $q$, we significantly enhance the approximation ratio from 11 to 3, advancing the state of the art in both cases.</p>

                  <p>Medication recommendation systems have garnered attention within healthcare for their potential to deliver personalized and efficacious drug combinations based on patient's clinical data.However, existing methodologies encounter challenges in adapting to diverse Electronic Health Records (EHR) systems and effectively utilizing unstructured data, resulting in limited generalization capabilities and suboptimal performance.Recently, interest is growing in harnessing Large Language Models (LLMs) in the medical domain to support healthcare professionals and enhance patient care.Despite the emergence of medical LLMs and their promising results in tasks like medical question answering, their practical applicability in clinical settings, particularly in medication recommendation, often remains underexplored.   In this study, we evaluate both general-purpose and medical-specific LLMs for medication recommendation tasks.Our findings reveal that LLMs frequently encounter the challenge of overprescribing, leading to heightened clinical risks and diminished medication recommendation accuracy.To address this issue, we propose Language-Assisted Medication Recommendation (LAMO), which employs a parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach to tailor open-source LLMs for optimal performance in medication recommendation scenarios.LAMO leverages the wealth of clinical information within clinical notes, a resource often underutilized in traditional methodologies.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>As a result of our approach, LAMO outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by over 10% in internal validation accuracy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.687</span></span>Furthermore, temporal and external validations demonstrate LAMO's robust generalization capabilities across various temporal and hospital contexts.Additionally, an out-of-distribution medication recommendation experiment demonstrates LAMO's remarkable accuracy even with medications outside the training data.</p>

                  <p>JSON Schemas provide useful guardrails for developers of Web APIs to guarantee that the semi-structured JSON input provided by clients matches a predefined structure.This is important both to ensure the correctness of the data received as input and also to avoid potential security issues from processing input that is not correctly validated.However, this validation process can be time-consuming and adds overhead to every request.Different keywords in the JSON Schema specification have complex interactions that may increase validation time.Since popular APIs may process thousands of requests per second and schemas change infrequently, we observe that we can resolve some of the complexity ahead of time in order to achieve faster validation.   Our JSON Schema validator, Blaze, compiles complex schemas to an efficient representation in seconds to minutes, adding minimal overhead at build time.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Blaze incorporates several unique optimizations to reduce the validation time by an average of approximately 10x compared existing validators on a variety of datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.626</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In some cases, Blaze achieves a reduction in validation time of multiple orders of magnitude compared to the next fastest validator. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.607</span></span>We also demonstrate that several popular validators produce incorrect results in some cases, while Blaze maintains strict adherence to the JSON Schema specification.</p>

                  <p>We analyze the trade-off between the undetected error probability (i.e., the probability that the channel decoder outputs an erroneous message without detecting the error) and the total error probability in the short blocklength regime.We address the problem by developing two new finite blocklength achievability bounds, which we use to benchmark the performance of two coding schemes based on polar codes with outer cyclic redundancy check (CRC) codes -- also referred to as CRC-aided (CA) polar codes.The first bound is obtained by considering an outer detection code, whereas the second bound relies on a threshold test applied to the generalized information density.Similarly, in the first CA polar code scheme, we reserve a fraction of the outer CRC parity bits for error detection, whereas in the second scheme, we apply a threshold test (specifically, Forney's optimal rule) to the output of the successive cancellation list decoder.Numerical simulations performed on the binary-input AWGN channel reveal that, in the short-blocklength regime, the threshold-based approach is superior to the CRC-based approach, both in terms of bounds and performance of CA polar code schemes.We also consider the case of decoding with noisy channel-state information, which leads to a mismatched decoding setting.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results illustrate that, differently from the previous case, in this scenario, the CRC-based approach outperforms the threshold-based approach, which is more sensitive to the mismatch. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span></p>

                  <p>In modern large language models (LLMs), LLM alignment is of crucial importance and is typically achieved through methods such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and direct preference optimization (DPO).However, in most existing methods for LLM alignment, all tokens in the response are optimized using a sparse, response-level reward or preference annotation.The ignorance of token-level rewards may erroneously punish high-quality tokens or encourage low-quality tokens, resulting in suboptimal performance and slow convergence speed.To address this issue, we propose AlignDistil, an RLHF-equivalent distillation method for token-level reward optimization.Specifically, we introduce the reward learned by DPO into the RLHF objective and theoretically prove the equivalence between this objective and a token-level distillation process, where the teacher distribution linearly combines the logits from the DPO model and a reference model.On this basis, we further bridge the accuracy gap between the reward from the DPO model and the pure reward model, by building a contrastive DPO reward with a normal and a reverse DPO model.Moreover, to avoid under- and over-optimization on different tokens, we design a token adaptive logit extrapolation mechanism to construct an appropriate teacher distribution for each token.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our AlignDistil over existing methods and showcase fast convergence due to its token-level distributional reward optimization. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.612</span></span></p>

                  <p>The ever-growing availability of unlabeled data presents both opportunities and challenges for training artificial intelligence systems.While self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for extracting meaningful representations from vast amounts of unlabeled data, existing methods still struggle to adapt to the non-stationary, non-IID nature of real-world data streams without forgetting previously learned knowledge.Recent works have adopted a repeated cosine annealing schedule for large-scale continual pre-training; however, these schedules (1) inherently cause forgetting during the re-warming phase and (2) have not been systematically compared to existing continual SSL methods.In this work, we systematically compare the widely used cosine schedule with the recently proposed infinite learning rate schedule and empirically find the latter to be a more effective alternative.Our extensive empirical evaluation across diverse image and language datasets demonstrates that the infinite learning rate schedule consistently enhances continual pre-training performance compared to a repeated cosine decay without being restricted to a fixed iteration budget.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For instance, in a small-scale MAE pre-training setup, it outperforms several strong baselines from the literature. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.619</span></span>We then scale up our experiments to larger MAE pre-training and autoregressive language model pre-training.Our results show that the infinite learning rate schedule remains effective at scale, surpassing repeated cosine decay for both MAE pre-training and zero-shot LM benchmarks.</p>

                  <p>Existing long-form video generation frameworks lack automated planning, requiring manual input for storylines, scenes, cinematography, and character interactions, resulting in high costs and inefficiencies.To address these challenges, we present MovieAgent, an automated movie generation via multi-agent Chain of Thought (CoT) planning.MovieAgent offers two key advantages: 1) We firstly explore and define the paradigm of automated movie/long-video generation.Given a script and character bank, our MovieAgent can generates multi-scene, multi-shot long-form videos with a coherent narrative, while ensuring character consistency, synchronized subtitles, and stable audio throughout the film.2) MovieAgent introduces a hierarchical CoT-based reasoning process to automatically structure scenes, camera settings, and cinematography, significantly reducing human effort.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By employing multiple LLM agents to simulate the roles of a director, screenwriter, storyboard artist, and location manager, MovieAgent streamlines the production pipeline. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.687</span></span>Experiments demonstrate that MovieAgent achieves new state-of-the-art results in script faithfulness, character consistency, and narrative coherence.Our hierarchical framework takes a step forward and provides new insights into fully automated movie generation.The code and project website are available at: https://github.com/showlab/MovieAgent and https://weijiawu.github.io/MovieAgent.</p>

                  <p>We present Autoregressive Representation Alignment (ARRA), a new training framework that unlocks global-coherent text-to-image generation in autoregressive LLMs without architectural changes.Unlike prior work that requires complex architectural redesigns, ARRA aligns LLM hidden states with visual representations from external visual foundational models via a global visual alignment loss and a hybrid token, <HYBNEXT>.This token enforces dual constraints: local next-token prediction and global semantic distillation, enabling LLMs to implicitly learn spatial and contextual coherence while retaining their original autoregressive paradigm.Extensive experiments validate ARRA's plug-and-play versatility.When training from text-generation-only LLMs or random initialization, ARRA reduces FID by 25.5% (MIMIC-CXR), 8.8% (DeepEyeNet), and 7.5% (ImageNet) for advanced autoregressive LLMs like Chameleon and LlamaGen, all without framework modifications.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For domain adaption, ARRA aligns general-purpose LLMs with specialized models (e.g., BioMedCLIP), achieving an 18.6% FID reduction over direct fine-tuning on medical imaging (MIMIC-CXR). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span>By demonstrating that training objective redesign -- not just architectural innovation -- can resolve cross-modal global coherence challenges, ARRA offers a complementary paradigm for advancing autoregressive models.Code and models will be released to advance autoregressive image generation.</p>

                  <p>Diffusion models have driven the advancement of vision generation over the past years.However, it is often difficult to apply these large models in downstream tasks, due to massive fine-tuning cost.Recently, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has been applied for efficient tuning of diffusion models.Unfortunately, the capabilities of LoRA-tuned diffusion models are limited, since the same LoRA is used for different timesteps of the diffusion process.To tackle this problem, we introduce a general and concise TimeStep Master (TSM) paradigm with two key fine-tuning stages.In the fostering stage (1-stage), we apply different LoRAs to fine-tune the diffusion model at different timestep intervals.This results in different TimeStep LoRA experts that can effectively capture different noise levels.In the assembling stage (2-stage), we design a novel asymmetrical mixture of TimeStep LoRA experts, via core-context collaboration of experts at multi-scale intervals.For each timestep, we leverage TimeStep LoRA expert within the smallest interval as the core expert without gating, and use experts within the bigger intervals as the context experts with time-dependent gating.Consequently, our TSM can effectively model the noise level via the expert in the finest interval, and adaptively integrate contexts from the experts of other scales, boosting the versatility of diffusion models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To show the effectiveness of our TSM paradigm, we conduct extensive experiments on three typical and popular LoRA-related tasks of diffusion models, including domain adaptation, post-pretraining, and model distillation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span>Our TSM achieves the state-of-the-art results on all these tasks, throughout various model structures (UNet, DiT and MM-DiT) and visual data modalities (Image, Video), showing its remarkable generalization capacity.</p>

                  <p>Although large visual-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in multimodal tasks, errors may occasionally arise due to biases during the reasoning process.Recently, reward models (RMs) have become increasingly pivotal in the reasoning process.Specifically, process RMs evaluate each reasoning step, outcome RMs focus on the assessment of reasoning results, and critique RMs perform error analysis on the entire reasoning process, followed by corrections.However, existing benchmarks for vision-language RMs (VLRMs) typically assess only a single aspect of their capabilities (e.g., distinguishing between two answers), thus limiting the all-round evaluation and restricting the development of RMs in the visual-language domain.To address this gap, we propose a comprehensive and challenging benchmark, dubbed as VLRMBench, encompassing 12,634 questions.VLRMBench is constructed based on three distinct types of datasets, covering mathematical reasoning, hallucination understanding, and multi-image understanding.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We design 12 tasks across three major categories, focusing on evaluating VLRMs in the aspects of process understanding, outcome judgment, and critique generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span>Extensive experiments are conducted on 21 open-source models and 5 advanced closed-source models, highlighting the challenges posed by VLRMBench.For instance, in the `Forecasting Future', a binary classification task, the advanced GPT-4o achieves only a 76.0% accuracy.Additionally, we perform comprehensive analytical studies, offering valuable insights for the future development of VLRMs.We anticipate that VLRMBench will serve as a pivotal benchmark in advancing VLRMs.Code and datasets will be available at https://github.com/JCruan519/VLRMBench.</p>

                  <p>In large language models (LLMs), code and reasoning reinforce each other: code offers an abstract, modular, and logic-driven structure that supports reasoning, while reasoning translates high-level goals into smaller, executable steps that drive more advanced code intelligence.In this study, we examine how code serves as a structured medium for enhancing reasoning: it provides verifiable execution paths, enforces logical decomposition, and enables runtime validation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also explore how improvements in reasoning have transformed code intelligence from basic completion to advanced capabilities, enabling models to address complex software engineering tasks through planning and debugging. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.637</span></span>Finally, we identify key challenges and propose future research directions to strengthen this synergy, ultimately improving LLM's performance in both areas.</p>

                  <p>[Context] Technical debt (TD) in machine learning (ML) systems, much like its counterpart in software engineering (SE), holds the potential to lead to future rework, posing risks to productivity, quality, and team morale.Despite growing attention to TD in SE, the understanding of ML-specific code-related TD remains underexplored.[Objective]This paper aims to identify and discuss the relevance of code-related issues that lead to TD in ML code throughout the ML workflow.[Method] The study first compiled a list of 34 potential issues contributing to TD in ML code by examining the phases of the ML workflow, their typical associated activities, and problem types.This list was refined through two focus group sessions involving nine experienced ML professionals, where each issue was assessed based on its occurrence contributing to TD in ML code and its relevance.[Results] The list of issues contributing to TD in the source code of ML systems was refined from 34 to 30, with 24 of these issues considered highly relevant.The data pre-processing phase was the most critical, with 14 issues considered highly relevant.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Shortcuts in code related to typical pre-processing tasks (e.g., handling missing values, outliers, inconsistencies, scaling, rebalancing, and feature selection) often result in "patch fixes" rather than sustainable solutions, leading to the accumulation of TD and increasing maintenance costs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.61</span></span>Relevant issues were also found in the data collection, model creation and training, and model evaluation phases.[Conclusion] We have made the final list of issues available to the community and believe it will help raise awareness about issues that need to be addressed throughout the ML workflow to reduce TD and improve the maintainability of ML code.</p>
