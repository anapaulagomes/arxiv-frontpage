                  <p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced their knowledge and generative capabilities, leading to a surge of interest in leveraging LLMs for high-quality data synthesis.However, synthetic data generation via prompting LLMs remains challenging due to LLMs' limited understanding of target data distributions and the complexity of prompt engineering, especially for structured formatted data.To address these issues, we introduce DiffLM, a controllable data synthesis framework based on variational autoencoder (VAE), which further (1) leverages diffusion models to reserve more information of original distribution and format structure in the learned latent distribution and (2) decouples the learning of target distribution knowledge from the LLM's generative objectives via a plug-and-play latent feature injection module.As we observed significant discrepancies between the VAE's latent representations and the real data distribution, the latent diffusion module is introduced into our framework to learn a fully expressive latent distribution.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Evaluations on seven real-world datasets with structured formatted data (i.e., Tabular, Code and Tool data) demonstrate that DiffLM generates high-quality data, with performance on downstream tasks surpassing that of real data by 2-7 percent in certain cases. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.812</span></span>The data and code will be publicly available upon completion of internal review.</p>

                  <p>Converting webpage design into functional UI code is a critical step for building websites, which can be labor-intensive and time-consuming.To automate this design-to-code transformation process, various automated methods using learning-based networks and multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have been proposed.However, these studies were merely evaluated on a narrow range of static web pages and ignored dynamic interaction elements, making them less practical for real-world website deployment.   To fill in the blank, we present the first systematic investigation of MLLMs in generating interactive webpages.Specifically, we first formulate the Interaction-to-Code task and build the Interaction2Code benchmark that contains 97 unique web pages and 213 distinct interactions, spanning 15 webpage types and 30 interaction categories.We then conduct comprehensive experiments on three state-of-the-art (SOTA) MLLMs using both automatic metrics and human evaluations, thereby summarizing six findings accordingly.Our experimental results highlight the limitations of MLLMs in generating fine-grained interactive features and managing interactions with complex transformations and subtle visual modifications.We further analyze failure cases and their underlying causes, identifying 10 common failure types and assessing their severity.Additionally, our findings reveal three critical influencing factors, i.e., prompts, visual saliency, and textual descriptions, that can enhance the interaction generation performance of MLLMs.Based on these findings, we elicit implications for researchers and developers, providing a foundation for future advancements in this field.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Datasets and source code are available at https://github.com/WebPAI/Interaction2Code. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.87</span></span></p>

                  <p>Code translation transforms programs from one programming language (PL) to another.Several rule-based transpilers have been designed to automate code translation between different pairs of PLs.However, the rules can become obsolete as the PLs evolve and cannot generalize to other PLs.Recent studies have explored the automation of code translation using Large Language Models (LLMs).One key observation is that such techniques may work well for crafted benchmarks but fail to generalize to the scale and complexity of real-world projects with dependencies, custom types, PL-specific features, etc.   We propose AlphaTrans, a neuro-symbolic approach to automate repository-level code translation.AlphaTrans translates both source and test code, and employs multiple levels of validation to ensure the translation preserves the functionality of the source program.To break down the problem for LLMs, AlphaTrans leverages program analysis to decompose the program into fragments and translates them in the reverse call order.We leveraged AlphaTrans to translate ten real-world open-source projects consisting of <836, 8575, 2719> classes, methods, and tests.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>AlphaTrans translated the entire repository of these projects consisting of 6899 source code fragments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.805</span></span>99.1% of the translated code fragments are syntactically correct, and AlphaTrans validates the translations' runtime behavior and functional correctness for 25.8%.On average, the integrated translation and validation take 36 hours to translate a project, showing its scalability in practice.For the syntactically or semantically incorrect translations, AlphaTrans generates a report including existing translation, stack trace, test errors, or assertion failures.We provided these artifacts to two developers to fix the translation bugs in four projects.They were able to fix the issues in 20.1 hours on average and achieve all passing tests.</p>

                  <p>Personalization in Information Retrieval (IR) is a topic studied by the research community since a long time.However, there is still a lack of datasets to conduct large-scale evaluations of personalized IR; this is mainly due to the fact that collecting and curating high-quality user-related information requires significant costs and time investment.Furthermore, the creation of datasets for Personalized IR (PIR) tasks is affected by both privacy concerns and the need for accurate user-related data, which are often not publicly available.Recently, researchers have started to explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate synthetic datasets, which is a possible solution to generate data for low-resource tasks.In this paper, we investigate the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating synthetic documents to train an IR system for a Personalized Community Question Answering task.To study the effectiveness of IR models fine-tuned on LLM-generated data, we introduce a new dataset, named Sy-SE-PQA.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We build Sy-SE-PQA based on an existing dataset, SE-PQA, which consists of questions and answers posted on the popular StackExchange communities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.848</span></span>Starting from questions in SE-PQA, we generate synthetic answers using different prompt techniques and LLMs.Our findings suggest that LLMs have high potential in generating data tailored to users' needs.The synthetic data can replace human-written training data, even if the generated data may contain incorrect information.</p>

                  <p>Road safety remains a critical challenge worldwide, with approximately 1.35 million fatalities annually attributed to traffic accidents, often due to human errors.As we advance towards higher levels of vehicle automation, challenges still exist, as driving with automation can cognitively over-demand drivers if they engage in non-driving-related tasks (NDRTs), or lead to drowsiness if driving was the sole task.This calls for the urgent need for an effective Driver Monitoring System (DMS) that can evaluate cognitive load and drowsiness in SAE Level-2/3 autonomous driving contexts.In this study, we propose a novel multi-task DMS, termed VDMoE, which leverages RGB video input to monitor driver states non-invasively.By utilizing key facial features to minimize computational load and integrating remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG) for physiological insights, our approach enhances detection accuracy while maintaining efficiency.Additionally, we optimize the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework to accommodate multi-modal inputs and improve performance across different tasks.A novel prior-inclusive regularization method is introduced to align model outputs with statistical priors, thus accelerating convergence and mitigating overfitting risks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We validate our method with the creation of a new dataset (MCDD), which comprises RGB video and physiological indicators from 42 participants, and two public datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.736</span></span>Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of VDMoE in monitoring driver states, contributing to safer autonomous driving systems.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code and data will be released. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.785</span></span></p>

                  <p>Grasping is a fundamental skill in robotics with diverse applications across medical, industrial, and domestic domains.However, current approaches for predicting valid grasps are often tailored to specific grippers, limiting their applicability when gripper designs change.To address this limitation, we explore the transfer of grasping strategies between various gripper designs, enabling the use of data from diverse sources.In this work, we present an approach based on equivariant diffusion that facilitates gripper-agnostic encoding of scenes containing graspable objects and gripper-aware decoding of grasp poses by integrating gripper geometry into the model.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also develop a dataset generation framework that produces cluttered scenes with variable-sized object heaps, improving the training of grasp synthesis methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.818</span></span>Experimental evaluation on diverse object datasets demonstrates the generalizability of our approach across gripper architectures, ranging from simple parallel-jaw grippers to humanoid hands, outperforming both single-gripper and multi-gripper state-of-the-art methods.</p>

                  <p>Cognitive decline is a natural part of aging, often resulting in reduced cognitive abilities.In some cases, however, this decline is more pronounced, typically due to disorders such as Alzheimer's disease.Early detection of anomalous cognitive decline is crucial, as it can facilitate timely professional intervention.While medical data can help in this detection, it often involves invasive procedures.An alternative approach is to employ non-intrusive techniques such as speech or handwriting analysis, which do not necessarily affect daily activities.This survey reviews the most relevant methodologies that use deep learning techniques to automate the cognitive decline estimation task, including audio, text, and visual processing.We discuss the key features and advantages of each modality and methodology, including state-of-the-art approaches like Transformer architecture and foundation models.In addition, we present works that integrate different modalities to develop multimodal models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also highlight the most significant datasets and the quantitative results from studies using these resources. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.725</span></span>From this review, several conclusions emerge.In most cases, the textual modality achieves the best results and is the most relevant for detecting cognitive decline.Moreover, combining various approaches from individual modalities into a multimodal model consistently enhances performance across nearly all scenarios.</p>

                  <p>Content moderation typically combines the efforts of human moderators and machine learning models.However, these systems often rely on data where significant disagreement occurs during moderation, reflecting the subjective nature of toxicity perception.Rather than dismissing this disagreement as noise, we interpret it as a valuable signal that highlights the inherent ambiguity of the content,an insight missed when only the majority label is considered.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we introduce a novel content moderation framework that emphasizes the importance of capturing annotation disagreement. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.637</span></span>Our approach uses multitask learning, where toxicity classification serves as the primary task and annotation disagreement is addressed as an auxiliary task.Additionally, we leverage uncertainty estimation techniques, specifically Conformal Prediction, to account for both the ambiguity in comment annotations and the model's inherent uncertainty in predicting toxicity and disagreement.The framework also allows moderators to adjust thresholds for annotation disagreement, offering flexibility in determining when ambiguity should trigger a review.We demonstrate that our joint approach enhances model performance, calibration, and uncertainty estimation, while offering greater parameter efficiency and improving the review process in comparison to single-task methods.</p>

                  <p>The denoising diffusion model has recently emerged as a powerful generative technique, capable of transforming noise into meaningful data.While theoretical convergence guarantees for diffusion models are well established when the target distribution aligns with the training distribution, practical scenarios often present mismatches.One common case is in zero-shot conditional diffusion sampling, where the target conditional distribution is different from the (unconditional) training distribution.These score-mismatched diffusion models remain largely unexplored from a theoretical perspective.In this paper, we present the first performance guarantee with explicit dimensional dependencies for general score-mismatched diffusion samplers, focusing on target distributions with finite second moments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We show that score mismatches result in an asymptotic distributional bias between the target and sampling distributions, proportional to the accumulated mismatch between the target and training distributions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span>This result can be directly applied to zero-shot conditional samplers for any conditional model, irrespective of measurement noise.Interestingly, the derived convergence upper bound offers useful guidance for designing a novel bias-optimal zero-shot sampler in linear conditional models that minimizes the asymptotic bias.For such bias-optimal samplers, we further establish convergence guarantees with explicit dependencies on dimension and conditioning, applied to several interesting target distributions, including those with bounded support and Gaussian mixtures.Our findings are supported by numerical studies.</p>

                  <p>In-context Learning (ICL) has become the primary method for performing natural language tasks with Large Language Models (LLMs).The knowledge acquired during pre-training is crucial for this few-shot capability, providing the model with task priors.However, recent studies have shown that ICL predominantly relies on retrieving task priors rather than "learning" to perform tasks.This limitation is particularly evident in complex subjective domains such as emotion and morality, where priors significantly influence posterior predictions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we examine whether this is the result of the aggregation used in corresponding datasets, where trying to combine low-agreement, disparate annotations might lead to annotation artifacts that create detrimental noise in the prompt. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.611</span></span>Moreover, we evaluate the posterior bias towards certain annotators by grounding our study in appropriate, quantitative measures of LLM priors.Our results indicate that aggregation is a confounding factor in the modeling of subjective tasks, and advocate focusing on modeling individuals instead.However, aggregation does not explain the entire gap between ICL and the state of the art, meaning other factors in such tasks also account for the observed phenomena.Finally, by rigorously studying annotator-level labels, we find that it is possible for minority annotators to both better align with LLMs and have their perspectives further amplified.</p>

                  <p>Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising solution to the privacy concerns associated with centralized Machine Learning (ML) by enabling decentralized, collaborative learning.However, FL is vulnerable to various security threats, including poisoning attacks, where adversarial clients manipulate the training data or model updates to degrade overall model performance.Recognizing this threat, researchers have focused on developing defense mechanisms to counteract poisoning attacks in FL systems.However, existing robust FL methods predominantly focus on computer vision tasks, leaving a gap in addressing the unique challenges of FL with time series data.In this paper, we present FLORAL, a defense mechanism designed to mitigate poisoning attacks in federated learning for time-series tasks, even in scenarios with heterogeneous client data and a large number of adversarial participants.Unlike traditional model-centric defenses, FLORAL leverages logical reasoning to evaluate client trustworthiness by aligning their predictions with global time-series patterns, rather than relying solely on the similarity of client updates.Our approach extracts logical reasoning properties from clients, then hierarchically infers global properties, and uses these to verify client updates.Through formal logic verification, we assess the robustness of each client contribution, identifying deviations indicative of adversarial behavior.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared to existing baseline methods, highlighting its potential to enhance the robustness of FL to time series applications. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span>Notably, FLORAL reduced the prediction error by 93.27\% in the best-case scenario compared to the second-best baseline.Our code is available at \url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/FLORAL-Robust-FTS}.</p>

                  <p>Image shadow removal is a typical low-level vision problem, where the presence of shadows leads to abrupt changes in brightness in certain regions, affecting the accuracy of upstream tasks.Current shadow removal methods still face challenges such as residual boundary artifacts, and capturing feature information at shadow boundaries is crucial for removing shadows and eliminating residual boundary artifacts.Recently, Mamba has achieved remarkable success in computer vision by globally modeling long-sequence information with linear complexity.However, when applied to image shadow removal, the original Mamba scanning method overlooks the semantic continuity of shadow boundaries as well as the continuity of semantics within the same region.Based on the unique characteristics of shadow images, this paper proposes a novel selective scanning method called boundary-region selective scanning.This method scans boundary regions, shadow regions, and non-shadow regions independently, bringing pixels of the same region type closer together in the long sequence, especially focusing on the local information at the boundaries, which is crucial for shadow removal.This method combines with global scanning and channel scanning to jointly accomplish the shadow removal.We name our model ShadowMamba, the first Mamba-based model for shadow removal.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experimental results show that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art models across most metrics on multiple datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span>The code for ShadowMamba is available at (Code will be released upon acceptance).</p>

                  <p>The past year has witnessed the significant advancement of video-based large language models.However, the challenge of developing a unified model for both short and long video understanding remains unresolved.Most existing video LLMs cannot handle hour-long videos, while methods custom for long videos tend to be ineffective for shorter videos and images.In this paper, we identify the key issue as the redundant content in videos.To address this, we propose a novel pooling strategy that simultaneously achieves token compression and instruction-aware visual feature aggregation.Our model is termed Prompt-guided Pooling LLaVA, or PPLLaVA for short.Specifically, PPLLaVA consists of three core components: the CLIP-based visual-prompt alignment that extracts visual information relevant to the user's instructions, the prompt-guided pooling that compresses the visual sequence to arbitrary scales using convolution-style pooling, and the clip context extension designed for lengthy prompt common in visual dialogue.Moreover, our codebase also integrates the most advanced video Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and visual interleave training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments have validated the performance of our model. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.67</span></span>With superior throughput and only 1024 visual context, PPLLaVA achieves better results on image benchmarks as a video LLM, while achieving state-of-the-art performance across various video benchmarks, excelling in tasks ranging from caption generation to multiple-choice questions, and handling video lengths from seconds to hours.Codes have been available at https://github.com/farewellthree/PPLLaVA.</p>

                  <p>Texturing is a crucial step in the 3D asset production workflow, which enhances the visual appeal and diversity of 3D assets.Despite recent advancements in Text-to-Texture (T2T) generation, existing methods often yield subpar results, primarily due to local discontinuities, inconsistencies across multiple views, and their heavy dependence on UV unwrapping outcomes.To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel generation-refinement 3D texturing framework called MVPaint, which can generate high-resolution, seamless textures while emphasizing multi-view consistency.MVPaint mainly consists of three key modules.1) Synchronized Multi-view Generation (SMG).Given a 3D mesh model, MVPaint first simultaneously generates multi-view images by employing an SMG model, which leads to coarse texturing results with unpainted parts due to missing observations.2) Spatial-aware 3D Inpainting (S3I).To ensure complete 3D texturing, we introduce the S3I method, specifically designed to effectively texture previously unobserved areas.3) UV Refinement (UVR).Furthermore, MVPaint employs a UVR module to improve the texture quality in the UV space, which first performs a UV-space Super-Resolution, followed by a Spatial-aware Seam-Smoothing algorithm for revising spatial texturing discontinuities caused by UV unwrapping.Moreover, we establish two T2T evaluation benchmarks: the Objaverse T2T benchmark and the GSO T2T benchmark, based on selected high-quality 3D meshes from the Objaverse dataset and the entire GSO dataset, respectively.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experimental results demonstrate that MVPaint surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.649</span></span>Notably, MVPaint could generate high-fidelity textures with minimal Janus issues and highly enhanced cross-view consistency.</p>

                  <p>Mixed precision quantization has become an important technique for enabling the execution of deep neural networks (DNNs) on limited resource computing platforms.Traditional quantization methods have primarily concentrated on maintaining neural network accuracy, either ignoring the impact of quantization on the robustness of the network, or using only empirical techniques for improving robustness.In contrast, techniques for robustness certification, which can provide strong guarantees about the robustness of DNNs have not been used during quantization due to their high computation cost.   This paper introduces ARQ, an innovative mixed-precision quantization method that not only preserves the clean accuracy of the smoothed classifiers but also maintains their certified robustness.ARQ uses reinforcement learning to find accurate and robust DNN quantization, while efficiently leveraging randomized smoothing, a popular class of statistical DNN verification algorithms, to guide the search process.   We compare ARQ with multiple state-of-the-art quantization techniques on several DNN architectures commonly used in quantization studies: ResNet-20 on CIFAR-10, ResNet-50 on ImageNet, and MobileNetV2 on ImageNet.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We demonstrate that ARQ consistently performs better than these baselines across all the benchmarks and the input perturbation levels. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.619</span></span>In many cases, the performance of ARQ quantized networks can reach that of the original DNN with floating-point weights, but with only 1.5% instructions.</p>

                  <p>Deep neural networks are susceptible to adversarial attacks and common corruptions, which undermine their robustness.In order to enhance model resilience against such challenges, Adversarial Training (AT) has emerged as a prominent solution.Nevertheless, adversarial robustness is often attained at the expense of model fairness during AT, i.e., disparity in class-wise robustness of the model.While distinctive classes become more robust towards such adversaries, hard to detect classes suffer.Recently, research has focused on improving model fairness specifically for perturbed images, overlooking the accuracy of the most likely non-perturbed data.Additionally, despite their robustness against the adversaries encountered during model training, state-of-the-art adversarial trained models have difficulty maintaining robustness and fairness when confronted with diverse adversarial threats or common corruptions.In this work, we address the above concerns by introducing a novel approach called Fair Targeted Adversarial Training (FAIR-TAT).We show that using targeted adversarial attacks for adversarial training (instead of untargeted attacks) can allow for more favorable trade-offs with respect to adversarial fairness.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Empirical results validate the efficacy of our approach. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span></p>

                  <p>Visual content and accompanied audio signals naturally formulate a joint representation to improve audio-visual (AV) related applications.While studies develop various AV representation learning frameworks, the importance of AV data alignment is usually undermined for achieving high-quality representation.We observe that an audio signal may contain background noise interference.Also, non-synchronization may appear between audio and video streams.These non-strict data alignment limits representation quality and downgrade application performance.In this paper, we propose to improve AV joint representations from a data-centric perspective by aligning audio signals to visual data.Our alignment is conducted in an agentic workflow controlled by an LLM-based assistant named AVAgent.For each input AV data pair, our AVAgent uses a multi-modal LLM to convert audio and visual data into language descriptions separately (i.e., tool use).Then, AVAgent reasons whether this paired data is aligned well and plans to edit the audio signal if needed (i.e., planning).The audio editing is executed by predefined actions that filter noise or augment data.Moreover, we use a VLM to evaluate how modified audio signals match the visual content and provide feedback to AVAgent (i.e., reflection).The tool use, planning, and reflection steps operate cyclically to become an agentic workflow where audio signals are gradually aligned to visual content.To this end, existing methods can directly leverage the aligned AV data via our agentic workflow to improve AV joint representations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The experimental results comprehensively demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed approach against previous baselines in diverse downstream tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.64</span></span></p>

We show that the core can be approximated only under structured loss functions, and even then, the best approximation we are able to establish, using an adaptation of the GreedyCapture algorithm developed for centroid clustering[Chen et al., 2019; Micha and Shah, 2020], is unappealing for a natural loss function.In contrast, we design a new (inefficient) algorithm, GreedyCohesiveClustering, which achieves the relaxation FJR exactly under arbitrary loss functions, and show that the efficient GreedyCapture algorithm achieves a constant approximation of FJR.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also design an efficient auditing algorithm, which estimates the FJR approximation of any given clustering solution up to a constant factor. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span>Our experiments on real data suggest that traditional clustering algorithms are highly unfair, whereas GreedyCapture is considerably fairer and incurs only a modest loss in common clustering objectives.</p>

                  <p>Authenticated Key Exchange (AKE) between any two entities is one of the most important security protocols available for securing our digital networks and infrastructures.In PQCrypto 2023, Bruckner, Ramacher and Striecks proposed a novel hybrid AKE (HAKE) protocol, dubbed Muckle+, that is particularly useful in large quantum-safe networks consisting of a large number of nodes.Their protocol is hybrid in the sense that it allows key material from conventional and post-quantum primitives, as well as from quantum key distribution, to be incorporated into a single end-to-end shared key.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To achieve the desired authentication properties, Muckle+ utilizes post-quantum digital signatures. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.609</span></span>However, available instantiations of such signatures schemes are not yet efficient enough compared to their post-quantum key-encapsulation mechanism (KEM) counterparts, particularly in large networks with potentially several connections in a short period of time.   To mitigate this gap, we propose Muckle# that pushes the efficiency boundaries of currently known HAKE constructions.Muckle# uses post-quantum key-encapsulating mechanisms for implicit authentication inspired by recent works done in the area of Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols, particularly, in KEMTLS (CCS'20).   We port those ideas to the HAKE framework and develop novel proof techniques on the way.Due to our novel KEM-based approach, the resulting protocol has a slightly different message flow compared to prior work that we carefully align with the HAKE framework and which makes our changes to the Muckle+ non-trivial.</p>

Using activation patching, we characterize internal components that are critical in solving our logic problem.Overall, our work systemically uncovers novel aspects of small and large transformers, and continues the study of how they plan and reason.</p>

                  <p>Self-alignment, whereby models learn to improve themselves without human annotation, is a rapidly growing research area.However, existing techniques often fail to improve complex reasoning tasks due to the difficulty of assigning correct rewards.An orthogonal approach that is known to improve correctness is self-consistency, a method applied at inference time based on multiple sampling in order to find the most consistent answer.In this work, we extend the self-consistency concept to help train models.We thus introduce self-consistency preference optimization (ScPO), which iteratively trains consistent answers to be preferred over inconsistent ones on unsupervised new problems.We show ScPO leads to large improvements over conventional reward model training on reasoning tasks such as GSM8K and MATH, closing the gap with supervised training with gold answers or preferences, and that combining ScPO with standard supervised learning improves results even further.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>On ZebraLogic, ScPO finetunes Llama-3 8B to be superior to Llama-3 70B, Gemma-2 27B, and Claude-3 Haiku. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span></p>

                Medical Adaptation of Large Language and Vision-Language Models: Are We Making Progress?

                  <p>Several recent works seek to develop foundation models specifically for medical applications, adapting general-purpose large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) via continued pretraining on publicly available biomedical corpora.These works typically claim that such domain-adaptive pretraining (DAPT) improves performance on downstream medical tasks, such as answering medical licensing exam questions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we compare seven public "medical" LLMs and two VLMs against their corresponding base models, arriving at a different conclusion: all medical VLMs and nearly all medical LLMs fail to consistently improve over their base models in the zero-/few-shot prompting regime for medical question-answering (QA) tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.642</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For instance, across the tasks and model pairs we consider in the 3-shot setting, medical LLMs only outperform their base models in 12.1% of cases, reach a (statistical) tie in 49.8% of cases, and are significantly worse than their base models in the remaining 38.2% of cases. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.641</span></span>Our conclusions are based on (i) comparing each medical model head-to-head, directly against the corresponding base model; (ii) optimizing the prompts for each model separately; and (iii) accounting for statistical uncertainty in comparisons.While these basic practices are not consistently adopted in the literature, our ablations show that they substantially impact conclusions.Our findings suggest that state-of-the-art general-domain models may already exhibit strong medical knowledge and reasoning capabilities, and offer recommendations to strengthen the conclusions of future studies.</p>

                  <p>Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities across various visual understanding and reasoning tasks.However, their real-world deployment is often constrained by high latency during inference due to substantial compute required to process the large number of input tokens (predominantly from the image) by the LLM.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To reduce inference costs, one can either downsize the LLM or reduce the number of input image-tokens, the latter of which has been the focus of many recent works around token compression. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.673</span></span>However, it is unclear what the optimal trade-off is, as both the factors directly affect the VLM performance.We first characterize this optimal trade-off between the number of visual tokens and LLM parameters by establishing scaling laws that capture variations in performance with these two factors.Our results reveal a surprising trend: for visual reasoning tasks, the inference-optimal behavior in VLMs, i.e., minimum downstream error at any given fixed inference compute, is achieved when using the largest LLM that fits within the inference budget while minimizing visual token count - often to a single token.While the token reduction literature has mainly focused on maintaining base model performance by modestly reducing the token count (e.g., $5-10\times$), our results indicate that the compute-optimal inference regime requires operating under even higher token compression ratios.Based on these insights, we take some initial steps towards building approaches tailored for high token compression settings.Code is available at https://github.com/locuslab/llava-token-compression.</p>
