                  <p>The low-orbit mega-constellation network (LMCN) is an important part of the space-air-ground integrated network system.An effective satellite-ground interconnection design can result in a stable constellation topology for LMCNs.A naive solution is accessing the satellite with the longest remaining service time (LRST), which is widely used in previous designs.The Coordinated Satellite-Ground Interconnecting (CSGI), the state-of-the-art algorithm, coordinates the establishment of ground-satellite links (GSLs).Compared with existing solutions, it reduces latency by 19% and jitter by 70% on average.However, CSGI only supports the scenario where terminals access only one satellite and cannot fully utilize the multi-access capabilities of terminals.Additionally, CSGI's high computational complexity poses deployment challenges.To overcome these problems, we propose the Classification-based Longest Remaining Service Time (C-LRST) algorithm.C-LRST supports the actual scenario with multi-access capabilities.It adds optional paths during routing with low computational complexity, improving end-to-end communications quality.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct our 1000s simulation from Brazil to Lithuania on the open-source platform Hypatia. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.769</span></span>Experiment results show that compared with CSGI, C-LRST reduces the latency and increases the throughput by approximately 60% and 40%, respectively.In addition, C-LRST's GSL switching number is 14, whereas CSGI is 23.C-LRST has better link stability than CSGI.</p>

                  <p>Code translation transforms programs from one programming language (PL) to another.Several rule-based transpilers have been designed to automate code translation between different pairs of PLs.However, the rules can become obsolete as the PLs evolve and cannot generalize to other PLs.Recent studies have explored the automation of code translation using Large Language Models (LLMs).One key observation is that such techniques may work well for crafted benchmarks but fail to generalize to the scale and complexity of real-world projects with dependencies, custom types, PL-specific features, etc.   We propose AlphaTrans, a neuro-symbolic approach to automate repository-level code translation.AlphaTrans translates both source and test code, and employs multiple levels of validation to ensure the translation preserves the functionality of the source program.To break down the problem for LLMs, AlphaTrans leverages program analysis to decompose the program into fragments and translates them in the reverse call order.We leveraged AlphaTrans to translate ten real-world open-source projects consisting of <836, 8575, 2719> classes, methods, and tests.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>AlphaTrans translated the entire repository of these projects consisting of 6899 source code fragments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.805</span></span>99.1% of the translated code fragments are syntactically correct, and AlphaTrans validates the translations' runtime behavior and functional correctness for 25.8%.On average, the integrated translation and validation take 36 hours to translate a project, showing its scalability in practice.For the syntactically or semantically incorrect translations, AlphaTrans generates a report including existing translation, stack trace, test errors, or assertion failures.We provided these artifacts to two developers to fix the translation bugs in four projects.They were able to fix the issues in 20.1 hours on average and achieve all passing tests.</p>

                  <p>Human beings are endowed with a complementary learning system, which bridges the slow learning of general world dynamics with fast storage of episodic memory from a new experience.Previous video generation models, however, primarily focus on slow learning by pre-training on vast amounts of data, overlooking the fast learning phase crucial for episodic memory storage.This oversight leads to inconsistencies across temporally distant frames when generating longer videos, as these frames fall beyond the model's context window.To this end, we introduce SlowFast-VGen, a novel dual-speed learning system for action-driven long video generation.Our approach incorporates a masked conditional video diffusion model for the slow learning of world dynamics, alongside an inference-time fast learning strategy based on a temporal LoRA module.Specifically, the fast learning process updates its temporal LoRA parameters based on local inputs and outputs, thereby efficiently storing episodic memory in its parameters.We further propose a slow-fast learning loop algorithm that seamlessly integrates the inner fast learning loop into the outer slow learning loop, enabling the recall of prior multi-episode experiences for context-aware skill learning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To facilitate the slow learning of an approximate world model, we collect a large-scale dataset of 200k videos with language action annotations, covering a wide range of scenarios. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.784</span></span>Extensive experiments show that SlowFast-VGen outperforms baselines across various metrics for action-driven video generation, achieving an FVD score of 514 compared to 782, and maintaining consistency in longer videos, with an average of 0.37 scene cuts versus 0.89.The slow-fast learning loop algorithm significantly enhances performances on long-horizon planning tasks as well.Project Website: https://slowfast-vgen.github.io</p>

                  <p>Although large language models (LLMs) are typically aligned, they remain vulnerable to jailbreaking through either carefully crafted prompts in natural language or, interestingly, gibberish adversarial suffixes.However, gibberish tokens have received relatively less attention despite their success in attacking aligned LLMs.Recent work, AmpleGCG~\citep{liao2024amplegcg}, demonstrates that a generative model can quickly produce numerous customizable gibberish adversarial suffixes for any harmful query, exposing a range of alignment gaps in out-of-distribution (OOD) language spaces.To bring more attention to this area, we introduce AmpleGCG-Plus, an enhanced version that achieves better performance in fewer attempts.Through a series of exploratory experiments, we identify several training strategies to improve the learning of gibberish suffixes.Our results, verified under a strict evaluation setting, show that it outperforms AmpleGCG on both open-weight and closed-source models, achieving increases in attack success rate (ASR) of up to 17\% in the white-box setting against Llama-2-7B-chat, and more than tripling ASR in the black-box setting against GPT-4.Notably, AmpleGCG-Plus jailbreaks the newer GPT-4o series of models at similar rates to GPT-4, and, uncovers vulnerabilities against the recently proposed circuit breakers defense.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We publicly release AmpleGCG-Plus along with our collected training datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.825</span></span></p>

                  <p>Personalization in Information Retrieval (IR) is a topic studied by the research community since a long time.However, there is still a lack of datasets to conduct large-scale evaluations of personalized IR; this is mainly due to the fact that collecting and curating high-quality user-related information requires significant costs and time investment.Furthermore, the creation of datasets for Personalized IR (PIR) tasks is affected by both privacy concerns and the need for accurate user-related data, which are often not publicly available.Recently, researchers have started to explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate synthetic datasets, which is a possible solution to generate data for low-resource tasks.In this paper, we investigate the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating synthetic documents to train an IR system for a Personalized Community Question Answering task.To study the effectiveness of IR models fine-tuned on LLM-generated data, we introduce a new dataset, named Sy-SE-PQA.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We build Sy-SE-PQA based on an existing dataset, SE-PQA, which consists of questions and answers posted on the popular StackExchange communities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.848</span></span>Starting from questions in SE-PQA, we generate synthetic answers using different prompt techniques and LLMs.Our findings suggest that LLMs have high potential in generating data tailored to users' needs.The synthetic data can replace human-written training data, even if the generated data may contain incorrect information.</p>

                  <p>The denoising diffusion model has recently emerged as a powerful generative technique, capable of transforming noise into meaningful data.While theoretical convergence guarantees for diffusion models are well established when the target distribution aligns with the training distribution, practical scenarios often present mismatches.One common case is in zero-shot conditional diffusion sampling, where the target conditional distribution is different from the (unconditional) training distribution.These score-mismatched diffusion models remain largely unexplored from a theoretical perspective.In this paper, we present the first performance guarantee with explicit dimensional dependencies for general score-mismatched diffusion samplers, focusing on target distributions with finite second moments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We show that score mismatches result in an asymptotic distributional bias between the target and sampling distributions, proportional to the accumulated mismatch between the target and training distributions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span>This result can be directly applied to zero-shot conditional samplers for any conditional model, irrespective of measurement noise.Interestingly, the derived convergence upper bound offers useful guidance for designing a novel bias-optimal zero-shot sampler in linear conditional models that minimizes the asymptotic bias.For such bias-optimal samplers, we further establish convergence guarantees with explicit dependencies on dimension and conditioning, applied to several interesting target distributions, including those with bounded support and Gaussian mixtures.Our findings are supported by numerical studies.</p>

                  <p>Face recognition technologies are increasingly used in various applications, yet they are vulnerable to face spoofing attacks.These spoofing attacks often involve unique 3D structures, such as printed papers or mobile device screens.Although stereo-depth cameras can detect such attacks effectively, their high-cost limits their widespread adoption.Conversely, two-sensor systems without extrinsic calibration offer a cost-effective alternative but are unable to calculate depth using stereo techniques.In this work, we propose a method to overcome this challenge by leveraging facial attributes to derive disparity information and estimate relative depth for anti-spoofing purposes, using non-calibrated systems.We introduce a multi-modal anti-spoofing model, coined Disparity Model, that incorporates created disparity maps as a third modality alongside the two original sensor modalities.We demonstrate the effectiveness of the Disparity Model in countering various spoof attacks using a comprehensive dataset collected from the Intel RealSense ID Solution F455.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our method outperformed existing methods in the literature, achieving an Equal Error Rate (EER) of 1.71% and a False Negative Rate (FNR) of 2.77% at a False Positive Rate (FPR) of 1%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.723</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These errors are lower by 2.45% and 7.94% than the errors of the best comparison method, respectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.712</span></span>Additionally, we introduce a model ensemble that addresses 3D spoof attacks as well, achieving an EER of 2.04% and an FNR of 3.83% at an FPR of 1%.Overall, our work provides a state-of-the-art solution for the challenging task of anti-spoofing in non-calibrated systems that lack depth information.</p>

                  <p>Bilevel optimization problems are characterized by an interactive hierarchical structure, where the upper level seeks to optimize its strategy while simultaneously considering the response of the lower level.Evolutionary algorithms are commonly used to solve complex bilevel problems in practical scenarios, but they face significant resource consumption challenges due to the nested structure imposed by the implicit lower-level optimality condition.This challenge becomes even more pronounced as problem dimensions increase.Although recent methods have enhanced bilevel convergence through task-level knowledge sharing, further efficiency improvements are still hindered by redundant lower-level iterations that consume excessive resources while generating unpromising solutions.To overcome this challenge, this paper proposes an efficient dynamic resource allocation framework for evolutionary bilevel optimization, named DRC-BLEA.Compared to existing approaches, DRC-BLEA introduces a novel competitive quasi-parallel paradigm, in which multiple lower-level optimization tasks, derived from different upper-level individuals, compete for resources.A continuously updated selection probability is used to prioritize execution opportunities to promising tasks.Additionally, a cooperation mechanism is integrated within the competitive framework to further enhance efficiency and prevent premature convergence.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results compared with chosen state-of-the-art algorithms demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.742</span></span>Specifically, DRC-BLEA achieves competitive accuracy across diverse problem sets and real-world scenarios, while significantly reducing the number of function evaluations and overall running time.</p>

                  <p>The cooperative driving technology of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) is crucial for improving the efficiency and safety of transportation systems.Learning-based methods, such as Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), have demonstrated strong capabilities in cooperative decision-making tasks.However, existing MARL approaches still face challenges in terms of learning efficiency and performance.In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly advanced and shown remarkable abilities in various sequential decision-making tasks.To enhance the learning capabilities of cooperative agents while ensuring decision-making efficiency and cost-effectiveness, we propose LDPD, a language-driven policy distillation method for guiding MARL exploration.In this framework, a teacher agent based on LLM trains smaller student agents to achieve cooperative decision-making through its own decision-making demonstrations.The teacher agent enhances the observation information of CAVs and utilizes LLMs to perform complex cooperative decision-making reasoning, which also leverages carefully designed decision-making tools to achieve expert-level decisions, providing high-quality teaching experiences.The student agent then refines the teacher's prior knowledge into its own model through gradient policy updates.The experiments demonstrate that the students can rapidly improve their capabilities with minimal guidance from the teacher and eventually surpass the teacher's performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments show that our approach demonstrates better performance and learning efficiency compared to baseline methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.726</span></span></p>

                  <p>Mixed precision quantization has become an important technique for enabling the execution of deep neural networks (DNNs) on limited resource computing platforms.Traditional quantization methods have primarily concentrated on maintaining neural network accuracy, either ignoring the impact of quantization on the robustness of the network, or using only empirical techniques for improving robustness.In contrast, techniques for robustness certification, which can provide strong guarantees about the robustness of DNNs have not been used during quantization due to their high computation cost.   This paper introduces ARQ, an innovative mixed-precision quantization method that not only preserves the clean accuracy of the smoothed classifiers but also maintains their certified robustness.ARQ uses reinforcement learning to find accurate and robust DNN quantization, while efficiently leveraging randomized smoothing, a popular class of statistical DNN verification algorithms, to guide the search process.   We compare ARQ with multiple state-of-the-art quantization techniques on several DNN architectures commonly used in quantization studies: ResNet-20 on CIFAR-10, ResNet-50 on ImageNet, and MobileNetV2 on ImageNet.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We demonstrate that ARQ consistently performs better than these baselines across all the benchmarks and the input perturbation levels. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.619</span></span>In many cases, the performance of ARQ quantized networks can reach that of the original DNN with floating-point weights, but with only 1.5% instructions.</p>

                  <p>Deep neural networks are susceptible to adversarial attacks and common corruptions, which undermine their robustness.In order to enhance model resilience against such challenges, Adversarial Training (AT) has emerged as a prominent solution.Nevertheless, adversarial robustness is often attained at the expense of model fairness during AT, i.e., disparity in class-wise robustness of the model.While distinctive classes become more robust towards such adversaries, hard to detect classes suffer.Recently, research has focused on improving model fairness specifically for perturbed images, overlooking the accuracy of the most likely non-perturbed data.Additionally, despite their robustness against the adversaries encountered during model training, state-of-the-art adversarial trained models have difficulty maintaining robustness and fairness when confronted with diverse adversarial threats or common corruptions.In this work, we address the above concerns by introducing a novel approach called Fair Targeted Adversarial Training (FAIR-TAT).We show that using targeted adversarial attacks for adversarial training (instead of untargeted attacks) can allow for more favorable trade-offs with respect to adversarial fairness.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Empirical results validate the efficacy of our approach. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span></p>

                  <p>3D models have recently been popularized by the potentiality of end-to-end training offered first by Neural Radiance Fields and most recently by 3D Gaussian Splatting models.The latter has the big advantage of naturally providing fast training convergence and high editability.However, as the research around these is still in its infancy, there is still a gap in the literature regarding the model's scalability.In this work, we propose an approach enabling both memory and computation scalability of such models.More specifically, we propose an iterative pruning strategy that removes redundant information encoded in the model.We also enhance compressibility for the model by including in the optimization strategy a differentiable quantization and entropy coding estimator.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results on popular benchmarks showcase the effectiveness of the proposed approach and open the road to the broad deployability of such a solution even on resource-constrained devices. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.668</span></span></p>

                  <p>Visual content and accompanied audio signals naturally formulate a joint representation to improve audio-visual (AV) related applications.While studies develop various AV representation learning frameworks, the importance of AV data alignment is usually undermined for achieving high-quality representation.We observe that an audio signal may contain background noise interference.Also, non-synchronization may appear between audio and video streams.These non-strict data alignment limits representation quality and downgrade application performance.In this paper, we propose to improve AV joint representations from a data-centric perspective by aligning audio signals to visual data.Our alignment is conducted in an agentic workflow controlled by an LLM-based assistant named AVAgent.For each input AV data pair, our AVAgent uses a multi-modal LLM to convert audio and visual data into language descriptions separately (i.e., tool use).Then, AVAgent reasons whether this paired data is aligned well and plans to edit the audio signal if needed (i.e., planning).The audio editing is executed by predefined actions that filter noise or augment data.Moreover, we use a VLM to evaluate how modified audio signals match the visual content and provide feedback to AVAgent (i.e., reflection).The tool use, planning, and reflection steps operate cyclically to become an agentic workflow where audio signals are gradually aligned to visual content.To this end, existing methods can directly leverage the aligned AV data via our agentic workflow to improve AV joint representations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The experimental results comprehensively demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed approach against previous baselines in diverse downstream tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.64</span></span></p>

We show that the core can be approximated only under structured loss functions, and even then, the best approximation we are able to establish, using an adaptation of the GreedyCapture algorithm developed for centroid clustering[Chen et al., 2019; Micha and Shah, 2020], is unappealing for a natural loss function.In contrast, we design a new (inefficient) algorithm, GreedyCohesiveClustering, which achieves the relaxation FJR exactly under arbitrary loss functions, and show that the efficient GreedyCapture algorithm achieves a constant approximation of FJR.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also design an efficient auditing algorithm, which estimates the FJR approximation of any given clustering solution up to a constant factor. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span>Our experiments on real data suggest that traditional clustering algorithms are highly unfair, whereas GreedyCapture is considerably fairer and incurs only a modest loss in common clustering objectives.</p>

                  <p>As a fundamental operation in modern machine vision models, feature upsampling has been widely used and investigated in the literatures.An ideal upsampling operation should be lightweight, with low computational complexity.That is, it can not only improve the overall performance but also not affect the model complexity.Content-aware Reassembly of Features (CARAFE) is a well-designed learnable operation to achieve feature upsampling.Albeit encouraging performance achieved, this method requires generating large-scale kernels, which brings a mass of extra redundant parameters, and inherently has limited scalability.To this end, we propose a lightweight upsampling operation, termed Dynamic Lightweight Upsampling (DLU) in this paper.In particular, it first constructs a small-scale source kernel space, and then samples the large-scale kernels from the kernel space by introducing learnable guidance offsets, hence avoiding introducing a large collection of trainable parameters in upsampling.Experiments on several mainstream vision tasks show that our DLU achieves comparable and even better performance to the original CARAFE, but with much lower complexity, e.g., DLU requires 91% fewer parameters and at least 63% fewer FLOPs (Floating Point Operations) than CARAFE in the case of 16x upsampling, but outperforms the CARAFE by 0.3% mAP in object detection.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code is available at https://github.com/Fu0511/Dynamic-Lightweight-Upsampling. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span></p>

                  <p>Developing algorithms to differentiate between machine-generated texts and human-written texts has garnered substantial attention in recent years.Existing methods in this direction typically concern an offline setting where a dataset containing a mix of real and machine-generated texts is given upfront, and the task is to determine whether each sample in the dataset is from a large language model (LLM) or a human.However, in many practical scenarios, sources such as news websites, social media accounts, or on other forums publish content in a streaming fashion.Therefore, in this online scenario, how to quickly and accurately determine whether the source is an LLM with strong statistical guarantees is crucial for these media or platforms to function effectively and prevent the spread of misinformation and other potential misuse of LLMs.To tackle the problem of online detection, we develop an algorithm based on the techniques of sequential hypothesis testing by betting that not only builds upon and complements existing offline detection techniques but also enjoys statistical guarantees, which include a controlled false positive rate and the expected time to correctly identify a source as an LLM.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments were conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span></p>

Despite a vast collection of explainable AI (XAI) algorithms produced by the AI research community, successful examples of XAI are still relatively scarce in real-world AI applications.This can be due to the gap between what the XAI is designed for and how the XAI is actually perceived by end-users.As explainability is an inherently human-centered property, in recent years, the XAI field is starting to embrace human-centered approaches and increasingly realizing the importance of empirical studies of XAI design by involving human subjects.   To move a step towards a systematic review of empirical study for human-centered XAI design, in this survey, we first brief the technical landscape of commonly used XAI algorithms in existing empirical studies.Then we analyze the diverse stakeholders and needs-finding approaches.Next, we provide an overview of the design space explored in the current human-centered XAI design.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Further, we summarize the evaluation metrics based on evaluation goals. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span>Afterward, we analyze the common findings and pitfalls derived from existing studies.For each chapter, we provide a summary of current challenges and research opportunities.Finally, we conclude the survey with a framework for human-centered XAI design with empirical studies.</p>

                  <p>Treatment selection in breast cancer is guided by molecular subtypes and clinical characteristics.Recurrence risk assessment plays a crucial role in personalizing treatment.Current methods, including genomic assays, have limited accuracy and clinical utility, leading to suboptimal decisions for many patients.We developed a test for breast cancer patient stratification based on digital pathology and clinical characteristics using novel AI methods.Specifically, we utilized a vision transformer-based pan-cancer foundation model trained with self-supervised learning to extract features from digitized H&E-stained slides.These features were integrated with clinical data to form a multi-modal AI test predicting cancer recurrence and death.The test was developed and evaluated using data from a total of 8,161 breast cancer patients across 15 cohorts originating from seven countries.Of these, 3,502 patients from five cohorts were used exclusively for evaluation, while the remaining patients were used for training.Our test accurately predicted our primary endpoint, disease-free interval, in the five external cohorts (C-index: 0.71[0.68-0.75], HR: 3.63[3.02-4.37, p<0.01]).In a direct comparison (N=858), the AI test was more accurate than Oncotype DX, the standard-of-care 21-gene assay, with a C-index of 0.67[0.61-0.74] versus 0.61[0.49-0.73], respectively.Additionally, the AI test added independent information to Oncotype DX in a multivariate analysis (HR: 3.11 [1.91-5.09, p<0.01)]).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The test demonstrated robust accuracy across all major breast cancer subtypes, including TNBC (C-index: 0.71 <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span>[0.62-0.81], HR: 3.81[2.35-6.17, p=0.02]), where no diagnostic tools are currently recommended by clinical guidelines.These results suggest that our AI test can improve accuracy, extend applicability to a wider range of patients, and enhance access to treatment selection tools.</p>

                  <p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have become essential for advancing the integration of visual and linguistic information, facilitating a wide range of complex applications and tasks.However, the evaluation of LVLMs presents significant challenges as the evaluation benchmark always demands lots of human cost for its construction, and remains static, lacking flexibility once constructed.Even though automatic evaluation has been explored in textual modality, the visual modality remains under-explored.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>As a result, in this work, we address a question: "Can LVLMs serve as a path to automatic benchmarking?". <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.63</span></span>We introduce AutoBench-V, an automated framework for serving evaluation on demand, i.e., benchmarking LVLMs based on specific aspects of model capability.Upon receiving an evaluation capability, AutoBench-V leverages text-to-image models to generate relevant image samples and then utilizes LVLMs to orchestrate visual question-answering (VQA) tasks, completing the evaluation process efficiently and flexibly.Through an extensive evaluation of seven popular LVLMs across five demanded user inputs (i.e., evaluation capabilities), the framework shows effectiveness and reliability.We observe the following: (1) Our constructed benchmark accurately reflects varying task difficulties; (2) As task difficulty rises, the performance gap between models widens; (3) While models exhibit strong performance in abstract level understanding, they underperform in details reasoning tasks; and (4) Constructing a dataset with varying levels of difficulties is critical for a comprehensive and exhaustive evaluation.Overall, AutoBench-V not only successfully utilizes LVLMs for automated benchmarking but also reveals that LVLMs as judges have significant potential in various domains.</p>

                  <p>Continuous prompts, or "soft prompts", are a widely-adopted parameter-efficient tuning strategy for large language models, but are often less favorable due to their opaque nature.Prior attempts to interpret continuous prompts relied on projecting individual prompt tokens onto the vocabulary space.However, this approach is problematic as performant prompts can yield arbitrary or contradictory text, and it interprets prompt tokens individually.In this work, we propose a new approach to interpret continuous prompts that elicits textual descriptions from their representations during model inference.Using a Patchscopes variant (Ghandeharioun et al., 2024) called InSPEcT over various tasks, we show our method often yields accurate task descriptions which become more faithful as task performance increases.Moreover, an elaborated version of InSPEcT reveals biased features in continuous prompts, whose presence correlates with biased model predictions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Providing an effective interpretability solution, InSPEcT can be leveraged to debug unwanted properties in continuous prompts and inform developers on ways to mitigate them. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.661</span></span></p>
