                  <p>Humans are undoubtedly the most important participants in computer vision, and the ability to detect any individual given a natural language description, a task we define as referring to any person, holds substantial practical value.However, we find that existing models generally fail to achieve real-world usability, and current benchmarks are limited by their focus on one-to-one referring, that hinder progress in this area.In this work, we revisit this task from three critical perspectives: task definition, dataset design, and model architecture.We first identify five aspects of referable entities and three distinctive characteristics of this task.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Next, we introduce HumanRef, a novel dataset designed to tackle these challenges and better reflect real-world applications. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.879</span></span>From a model design perspective, we integrate a multimodal large language model with an object detection framework, constructing a robust referring model named RexSeek.Experimental results reveal that state-of-the-art models, which perform well on commonly used benchmarks like RefCOCO/+/g, struggle with HumanRef due to their inability to detect multiple individuals.In contrast, RexSeek not only excels in human referring but also generalizes effectively to common object referring, making it broadly applicable across various perception tasks.Code is available at https://github.com/IDEA-Research/RexSeek</p>

                  <p>In recent years, lightweight large language models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention in the robotics field due to their low computational resource requirements and suitability for edge deployment.However, in task planning -- particularly for complex tasks that involve dynamic semantic logic reasoning -- lightweight LLMs have underperformed.To address this limitation, we propose a novel task planner, LightPlanner, which enhances the performance of lightweight LLMs in complex task planning by fully leveraging their reasoning capabilities.Unlike conventional planners that use fixed skill templates, LightPlanner controls robot actions via parameterized function calls, dynamically generating parameter values.This approach allows for fine-grained skill control and improves task planning success rates in complex scenarios.Furthermore, we introduce hierarchical deep reasoning.Before generating each action decision step, LightPlanner thoroughly considers three levels: action execution (feedback verification), semantic parsing (goal consistency verification), and parameter generation (parameter validity verification).This ensures the correctness of subsequent action controls.Additionally, we incorporate a memory module to store historical actions, thereby reducing context length and enhancing planning efficiency for long-term tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We train the LightPlanner-1.5B model on our LightPlan-40k dataset, which comprises 40,000 action controls across tasks with 2 to 13 action steps. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.815</span></span>Experiments demonstrate that our model achieves the highest task success rate despite having the smallest number of parameters.In tasks involving spatial semantic reasoning, the success rate exceeds that of ReAct by 14.9 percent.Moreover, we demonstrate LightPlanner's potential to operate on edge devices.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in Virtual Try-On (VITON) have significantly improved image realism and garment detail preservation, driven by powerful text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models.However, existing methods often rely on user-provided masks, introducing complexity and performance degradation due to imperfect inputs, as shown in Fig.1(a).To address this, we propose a Mask-Free VITON (MF-VITON) framework that achieves realistic VITON using only a single person image and a target garment, eliminating the requirement for auxiliary masks.Our approach introduces a novel two-stage pipeline: (1) We leverage existing Mask-based VITON models to synthesize a high-quality dataset.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This dataset contains diverse, realistic pairs of person images and corresponding garments, augmented with varied backgrounds to mimic real-world scenarios. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.885</span></span>(2) The pre-trained Mask-based model is fine-tuned on the generated dataset, enabling garment transfer without mask dependencies.This stage simplifies the input requirements while preserving garment texture and shape fidelity.Our framework achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance regarding garment transfer accuracy and visual realism.Notably, the proposed Mask-Free model significantly outperforms existing Mask-based approaches, setting a new benchmark and demonstrating a substantial lead over previous approaches.For more details, visit our project page: https://zhenchenwan.github.io/MF-VITON/.</p>

                  <p>Although large visual-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in multimodal tasks, errors may occasionally arise due to biases during the reasoning process.Recently, reward models (RMs) have become increasingly pivotal in the reasoning process.Specifically, process RMs evaluate each reasoning step, outcome RMs focus on the assessment of reasoning results, and critique RMs perform error analysis on the entire reasoning process, followed by corrections.However, existing benchmarks for vision-language RMs (VLRMs) typically assess only a single aspect of their capabilities (e.g., distinguishing between two answers), thus limiting the all-round evaluation and restricting the development of RMs in the visual-language domain.To address this gap, we propose a comprehensive and challenging benchmark, dubbed as VLRMBench, encompassing 12,634 questions.VLRMBench is constructed based on three distinct types of datasets, covering mathematical reasoning, hallucination understanding, and multi-image understanding.We design 12 tasks across three major categories, focusing on evaluating VLRMs in the aspects of process understanding, outcome judgment, and critique generation.Extensive experiments are conducted on 21 open-source models and 5 advanced closed-source models, highlighting the challenges posed by VLRMBench.For instance, in the `Forecasting Future', a binary classification task, the advanced GPT-4o achieves only a 76.0% accuracy.Additionally, we perform comprehensive analytical studies, offering valuable insights for the future development of VLRMs.We anticipate that VLRMBench will serve as a pivotal benchmark in advancing VLRMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code and datasets will be available at https://github.com/JCruan519/VLRMBench. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.852</span></span></p>

                  <p>Response consistency-based, reference-free hallucination detection (RFHD) methods do not depend on internal model states, such as generation probabilities or gradients, which Grey-box models typically rely on but are inaccessible in closed-source LLMs.However, their inability to capture query-response alignment patterns often results in lower detection accuracy.Additionally, the lack of large-scale benchmark datasets spanning diverse domains remains a challenge, as most existing datasets are limited in size and scope.To this end, we propose HalluCounter, a novel reference-free hallucination detection method that utilizes both response-response and query-response consistency and alignment patterns.This enables the training of a classifier that detects hallucinations and provides a confidence score and an optimal response for user queries.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we introduce HalluCounterEval, a benchmark dataset comprising both synthetically generated and human-curated samples across multiple domains. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.758</span></span>Our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by a significant margin, achieving over 90\% average confidence in hallucination detection across datasets.</p>

                  <p>High-quality data resources play a crucial role in learning large language models (LLMs), particularly for low-resource languages like Cantonese.Despite having more than 85 million native speakers, Cantonese is still considered a low-resource language in the field of natural language processing (NLP) due to factors such as the dominance of Mandarin, lack of cohesion within the Cantonese-speaking community, diversity in character encoding and input methods, and the tendency of overseas Cantonese speakers to prefer using English.In addition, rich colloquial vocabulary of Cantonese, English loanwords, and code-switching characteristics add to the complexity of corpus collection and processing.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address these challenges, we collect Cantonese texts from a variety of sources, including open source corpora, Hong Kong-specific forums, Wikipedia, and Common Crawl data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.774</span></span>We conduct rigorous data processing through language filtering, quality filtering, content filtering, and de-duplication steps, successfully constructing a high-quality Cantonese corpus of over 2 billion tokens for training large language models.We further refined the model through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on curated Cantonese tasks, enhancing its ability to handle specific applications.Upon completion of the training, the model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on four Cantonese benchmarks.After training on our dataset, the model also exhibits improved performance on other mainstream language tasks.</p>

                  <p>The advancement of visual language models (VLMs) has enhanced mobile device operations, allowing simulated human-like actions to address user requirements.Current VLM-based mobile operating assistants can be structured into three levels: task, subtask, and action.The subtask level, linking high-level goals with low-level executable actions, is crucial for task completion but faces two challenges: ineffective subtasks that lower-level agent cannot execute and inefficient subtasks that fail to contribute to the completion of the higher-level task.These challenges stem from VLM's lack of experience in decomposing subtasks within GUI scenarios in multi-agent architecture.To address these, we propose a new mobile assistant architecture with constrained high-frequency o}ptimized planning (CHOP).Our approach overcomes the VLM's deficiency in GUI scenarios planning by using human-planned subtasks as the basis vector.We evaluate our architecture in both English and Chinese contexts across 20 Apps, demonstrating significant improvements in both effectiveness and efficiency.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our dataset and code is available at https://github.com/Yuqi-Zhou/CHOP <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.853</span></span></p>

                  <p>The real-time process of directional changes while drilling, known as geosteering, is crucial for hydrocarbon extraction and emerging directional drilling applications such as geothermal energy, civil infrastructure, and CO2 storage.The geo-energy industry seeks an automatic geosteering workflow that continually updates the subsurface uncertainties and captures the latest geological understanding given the most recent observations in real-time.   We propose "DISTINGUISH": a real-time, AI-driven workflow designed to transform geosteering by integrating Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for geological parameterization, ensemble methods for model updating, and global discrete dynamic programming (DDP) optimization for complex decision-making during directional drilling operations.The DISTINGUISH framework relies on offline training of a GAN model to reproduce relevant geology realizations and a Forward Neural Network (FNN) to model Logging-While-Drilling (LWD) tools' response for a given geomodel.   This paper introduces a first-of-its-kind workflow that progressively reduces GAN-geomodel uncertainty around and ahead of the drilling bit and adjusts the well plan accordingly.The workflow automatically integrates real-time LWD data with a DDP-based decision support system, enhancing predictive models of geology ahead of drilling and leading to better steering decisions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We present a simple yet representative benchmark case and document the performance target achieved by the DISTINGUISH workflow prototype. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.637</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This benchmark will be a foundation for future methodological advancements and workflow refinements. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.679</span></span></p>

                  <p>In many practical scenarios of black box optimization, the objective function is subject to constraints that must be satisfied to avoid undesirable outcomes.Such constraints are typically unknown and must be learned during optimization.Safe Bayesian optimization aims to find the global optimum while ensuring that the constraints are satisfied with high probability.However, it is often sample-inefficient due to the small initial feasible set, which requires expansion by evaluating the objective or constraint functions, limiting its applicability to low-dimensional or inexpensive problems.To enhance sample efficiency, additional information from cheap simulations can be leveraged, albeit at the cost of safeness guarantees.This paper introduces a novel safe multi-task Bayesian optimization algorithm that integrates multiple tasks while maintaining high-probability safety.We derive robust uniform error bounds for the multi-task case and demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach on benchmark functions and a control problem.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results show a significant improvement in sample efficiency, making the proposed method well-suited for expensive-to-evaluate functions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.735</span></span></p>

                  <p>Bag-based Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) approaches have emerged as the mainstream methodology for Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification.However, most existing methods adopt a segmented training strategy, which first extracts features using a pre-trained feature extractor and then aggregates these features through MIL.This segmented training approach leads to insufficient collaborative optimization between the feature extraction network and the MIL network, preventing end-to-end joint optimization and thereby limiting the overall performance of the model.Additionally, conventional methods typically extract features from all patches of fixed size, ignoring the multi-scale observation characteristics of pathologists.This not only results in significant computational resource waste when tumor regions represent a minimal proportion (as in the Camelyon16 dataset) but may also lead the model to suboptimal solutions.   To address these limitations, this paper proposes an end-to-end multi-scale WSI classification framework that integrates multi-scale feature extraction with multiple instance learning.Specifically, our approach includes: (1) a semantic feature filtering module to reduce interference from non-lesion areas; (2) a multi-scale feature extraction module to capture pathological information at different levels; and (3) a multi-scale fusion MIL module for global modeling and feature integration.Through an end-to-end training strategy, we simultaneously optimize both the feature extractor and MIL network, ensuring maximum compatibility between them.   Experiments were conducted on three cross-center datasets (DigestPath2019, BCNB, and UBC-OCEAN).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both accuracy (ACC) and AUC metrics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.728</span></span></p>

                  <p>Object detection systems must reliably perceive objects of interest without being overly confident to ensure safe decision-making in dynamic environments.Filtering techniques based on out-of-distribution (OoD) detection are commonly added as an extra safeguard to filter hallucinations caused by overconfidence in novel objects.Nevertheless, evaluating YOLO-family detectors and their filters under existing OoD benchmarks often leads to unsatisfactory performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper studies the underlying reasons for performance bottlenecks and proposes a methodology to improve performance fundamentally. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.611</span></span>Our first contribution is a calibration of all existing evaluation results: Although images in existing OoD benchmark datasets are claimed not to have objects within in-distribution (ID) classes (i.e., categories defined in the training dataset), around 13% of objects detected by the object detector are actually ID objects.Dually, the ID dataset containing OoD objects can also negatively impact the decision boundary of filters.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These ultimately lead to a significantly imprecise performance estimation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.61</span></span>Our second contribution is to consider the task of hallucination reduction as a joint pipeline of detectors and filters.By developing a methodology to carefully synthesize an OoD dataset that semantically resembles the objects to be detected, and using the crafted OoD dataset in the fine-tuning of YOLO detectors to suppress the objectness score, we achieve a 88% reduction in overall hallucination error with a combined fine-tuned detection and filtering system on the self-driving benchmark BDD-100K.

                  <p>While cryptographic algorithms such as the ubiquitous Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) are secure, *physical implementations* of these algorithms in hardware inevitably 'leak' sensitive data such as cryptographic keys.A particularly insidious form of leakage arises from the fact that hardware consumes power and emits radiation in a manner that is statistically associated with the data it processes and the instructions it executes.Supervised deep learning has emerged as a state-of-the-art tool for carrying out *side-channel attacks*, which exploit this leakage by learning to map power/radiation measurements throughout encryption to the sensitive data operated on during that encryption.In this work we develop a principled deep learning framework for determining the relative leakage due to measurements recorded at different points in time, in order to inform *defense* against such attacks.This information is invaluable to cryptographic hardware designers for understanding *why* their hardware leaks and how they can mitigate it (e.g. by indicating the particular sections of code or electronic components which are responsible).Our framework is based on an adversarial game between a family of classifiers trained to estimate the conditional distributions of sensitive data given subsets of measurements, and a budget-constrained noise distribution which probabilistically erases individual measurements to maximize the loss of these classifiers.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We demonstrate our method's efficacy and ability to overcome limitations of prior work through extensive experimental comparison with 8 baseline methods using 3 evaluation metrics and 6 publicly-available power/EM trace datasets from AES, ECC and RSA implementations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.642</span></span>We provide an open-source PyTorch implementation of these experiments.</p>

                  <p>Enabling robots to learn novel tasks in a data-efficient manner is a long-standing challenge.Common strategies involve carefully leveraging prior experiences, especially transition data collected on related tasks.Although much progress has been made for general pick-and-place manipulation, far fewer studies have investigated contact-rich assembly tasks, where precise control is essential.We introduce SRSA (Skill Retrieval and Skill Adaptation), a novel framework designed to address this problem by utilizing a pre-existing skill library containing policies for diverse assembly tasks.The challenge lies in identifying which skill from the library is most relevant for fine-tuning on a new task.Our key hypothesis is that skills showing higher zero-shot success rates on a new task are better suited for rapid and effective fine-tuning on that task.To this end, we propose to predict the transfer success for all skills in the skill library on a novel task, and then use this prediction to guide the skill retrieval process.We establish a framework that jointly captures features of object geometry, physical dynamics, and expert actions to represent the tasks, allowing us to efficiently learn the transfer success predictor.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments demonstrate that SRSA significantly outperforms the leading baseline. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span>When retrieving and fine-tuning skills on unseen tasks, SRSA achieves a 19% relative improvement in success rate, exhibits 2.6x lower standard deviation across random seeds, and requires 2.4x fewer transition samples to reach a satisfactory success rate, compared to the baseline.Furthermore, policies trained with SRSA in simulation achieve a 90% mean success rate when deployed in the real world.Please visit our project webpage https://srsa2024.github.io/.</p>

In this study, we evaluate both general-purpose and medical-specific LLMs for medication recommendation tasks.Our findings reveal that LLMs frequently encounter the challenge of overprescribing, leading to heightened clinical risks and diminished medication recommendation accuracy.To address this issue, we propose Language-Assisted Medication Recommendation (LAMO), which employs a parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach to tailor open-source LLMs for optimal performance in medication recommendation scenarios.LAMO leverages the wealth of clinical information within clinical notes, a resource often underutilized in traditional methodologies.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>As a result of our approach, LAMO outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by over 10% in internal validation accuracy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.687</span></span>Furthermore, temporal and external validations demonstrate LAMO's robust generalization capabilities across various temporal and hospital contexts.Additionally, an out-of-distribution medication recommendation experiment demonstrates LAMO's remarkable accuracy even with medications outside the training data.</p>

Remarkably, without any retraining, the $D^3$ achieves success across a wide range of generation tasks for the first time.Experiments on large language models (\ie the Llama) with $7 \sim 70$ billion parameters show that $D^3$ can achieve an average 1.5x speedup compared with the full-inference pipeline while maintaining comparable performance with nearly no performance drop ($<1\%$) on the GSM8K and BBH benchmarks.</p>

                  <p>Surveys are a widespread method for collecting data at scale, but their rigid structure often limits the depth of qualitative insights obtained.While interviews naturally yield richer responses, they are challenging to conduct across diverse locations and large participant pools.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To partially bridge this gap, we investigate the potential of using LLM-based chatbots to support qualitative data collection through interview probes embedded in surveys. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.704</span></span>We assess four theory-based interview probes: descriptive, idiographic, clarifying, and explanatory.Through a split-plot study design (N=64), we compare the probes' impact on response quality and user experience across three key stages of HCI research: exploration, requirements gathering, and evaluation.Our results show that probes facilitate the collection of high-quality survey data, with specific probes proving effective at different research stages.We contribute practical and methodological implications for using chatbots as research tools to enrich qualitative data collection.</p>

                  <p><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Previous studies have found that PLM-based retrieval models exhibit a preference for LLM-generated content, assigning higher relevance scores to these documents even when their semantic quality is comparable to human-written ones. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.709</span></span>This phenomenon, known as source bias, threatens the sustainable development of the information access ecosystem.However, the underlying causes of source bias remain unexplored.In this paper, we explain the process of information retrieval with a causal graph and discover that PLM-based retrievers learn perplexity features for relevance estimation, causing source bias by ranking the documents with low perplexity higher.Theoretical analysis further reveals that the phenomenon stems from the positive correlation between the gradients of the loss functions in language modeling task and retrieval task.Based on the analysis, a causal-inspired inference-time debiasing method is proposed, called Causal Diagnosis and Correction (CDC).CDC first diagnoses the bias effect of the perplexity and then separates the bias effect from the overall estimated relevance score.Experimental results across three domains demonstrate the superior debiasing effectiveness of CDC, emphasizing the validity of our proposed explanatory framework.Source codes are available at https://github.com/WhyDwelledOnAi/Perplexity-Trap.</p>

Drawing inspiration from the ancient art of Japanese Bonsai gardening focused on balance, structure, and deliberate pruning: we propose a new approach to IDEs, where AI is allowed to generate in its true, unconstrained form, free from traditional file structures.This approach fosters a more fluid and interactive method for code evolution.We introduce the concept of a Bonsai-inspired IDE, structured as a graph of generated code snippets and multiple code paths, enabling developers to reshape AI generated code to suit their needs.Our vision calls for a shift away from a static file based model toward a dynamic, evolving system that allows for continuous refinement of generated code, with the IDE evolving alongside AI powered modifications rather than merely serving as a place to write and edit code.</p>

                  <p>In large language models (LLMs), code and reasoning reinforce each other: code offers an abstract, modular, and logic-driven structure that supports reasoning, while reasoning translates high-level goals into smaller, executable steps that drive more advanced code intelligence.In this study, we examine how code serves as a structured medium for enhancing reasoning: it provides verifiable execution paths, enforces logical decomposition, and enables runtime validation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also explore how improvements in reasoning have transformed code intelligence from basic completion to advanced capabilities, enabling models to address complex software engineering tasks through planning and debugging. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.637</span></span>Finally, we identify key challenges and propose future research directions to strengthen this synergy, ultimately improving LLM's performance in both areas.</p>
