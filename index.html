                  <p>The rapid and unrestrained advancement of generative artificial intelligence (AI) presents a double-edged sword: while enabling unprecedented creativity, it also facilitates the generation of highly convincing deceptive content, undermining societal trust.As image generation techniques become increasingly sophisticated, detecting synthetic images is no longer just a binary task: it necessitates interpretable, context-aware methodologies that enhance trustworthiness and transparency.However, existing detection models primarily focus on classification, offering limited explanatory insights into image authenticity.In this work, we propose FakeScope, an expert multimodal model (LMM) tailored for AI-generated image forensics, which not only identifies AI-synthetic images with high accuracy but also provides rich, interpretable, and query-driven forensic insights.We first construct FakeChain dataset that contains linguistic authenticity reasoning based on visual trace evidence, developed through a novel human-machine collaborative framework.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Building upon it, we further present FakeInstruct, the largest multimodal instruction tuning dataset containing 2 million visual instructions tailored to enhance forensic awareness in LMMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.761</span></span>FakeScope achieves state-of-the-art performance in both closed-ended and open-ended forensic scenarios.It can distinguish synthetic images with high accuracy while offering coherent and insightful explanations, free-form discussions on fine-grained forgery attributes, and actionable enhancement strategies.Notably, despite being trained exclusively on qualitative hard labels, FakeScope demonstrates remarkable zero-shot quantitative capability on detection, enabled by our proposed token-based probability estimation strategy.Furthermore, FakeScope exhibits strong generalization and in-the-wild ability, ensuring its applicability in real-world scenarios.</p>

                  <p>Objects produce different sounds when hit, and humans can intuitively infer how an object might sound based on its appearance and material properties.Inspired by this intuition, we propose Visual Acoustic Fields, a framework that bridges hitting sounds and visual signals within a 3D space using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS).Our approach features two key modules: sound generation and sound localization.The sound generation module leverages a conditional diffusion model, which takes multiscale features rendered from a feature-augmented 3DGS to generate realistic hitting sounds.Meanwhile, the sound localization module enables querying the 3D scene, represented by the feature-augmented 3DGS, to localize hitting positions based on the sound sources.To support this framework, we introduce a novel pipeline for collecting scene-level visual-sound sample pairs, achieving alignment between captured images, impact locations, and corresponding sounds.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first dataset to connect visual and acoustic signals in a 3D context. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.835</span></span>Extensive experiments on our dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of Visual Acoustic Fields in generating plausible impact sounds and accurately localizing impact sources.Our project page is at https://yuelei0428.github.io/projects/Visual-Acoustic-Fields/.</p>

                  <p>In recent years, performance on existing anomaly detection benchmarks like MVTec AD and VisA has started to saturate in terms of segmentation AU-PRO, with state-of-the-art models often competing in the range of less than one percentage point.This lack of discriminatory power prevents a meaningful comparison of models and thus hinders progress of the field, especially when considering the inherent stochastic nature of machine learning results.We present MVTec AD 2, a collection of eight anomaly detection scenarios with more than 8000 high-resolution images.It comprises challenging and highly relevant industrial inspection use cases that have not been considered in previous datasets, including transparent and overlapping objects, dark-field and back light illumination, objects with high variance in the normal data, and extremely small defects.We provide comprehensive evaluations of state-of-the-art methods and show that their performance remains below 60% average AU-PRO.Additionally, our dataset provides test scenarios with lighting condition changes to assess the robustness of methods under real-world distribution shifts.We host a publicly accessible evaluation server that holds the pixel-precise ground truth of the test set (https://benchmark.mvtec.com/).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>All image data is available at https://www.mvtec.com/company/research/datasets/mvtec-ad-2. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.712</span></span></p>

                  <p>The rapid development of multimodal large language models has resulted in remarkable advancements in visual perception and understanding, consolidating several tasks into a single visual question-answering framework.However, these models are prone to hallucinations, which limit their reliability as artificial intelligence systems.While this issue is extensively researched in natural language processing and image captioning, there remains a lack of investigation of hallucinations in Low-level Visual Perception and Understanding (HLPU), especially in the context of image quality assessment tasks.We consider that these hallucinations arise from an absence of clear self-awareness within the models.To address this issue, we first introduce the HLPU instruction database, the first instruction database specifically focused on hallucinations in low-level vision tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This database contains approximately 200K question-answer pairs and comprises four subsets, each covering different types of instructions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.82</span></span>Subsequently, we propose the Self-Awareness Failure Elimination (SAFEQA) model, which utilizes image features, salient region features and quality features to improve the perception and comprehension abilities of the model in low-level vision tasks.Furthermore, we propose the Enhancing Self-Awareness Preference Optimization (ESA-PO) framework to increase the model's awareness of knowledge boundaries, thereby mitigating the incidence of hallucination.Finally, we conduct comprehensive experiments on low-level vision tasks, with the results demonstrating that our proposed method significantly enhances self-awareness of the model in these tasks and reduces hallucinations.Notably, our proposed method improves both accuracy and self-awareness of the proposed model and outperforms close-source models in terms of various evaluation metrics.</p>

                  <p>Diagrams serve as a fundamental form of visual language, representing complex concepts and their inter-relationships through structured symbols, shapes, and spatial arrangements.Unlike natural images, their inherently symbolic and abstract nature poses significant challenges for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).However, current benchmarks conflate perceptual and reasoning tasks, making it difficult to assess whether MLLMs genuinely understand mathematical diagrams beyond superficial pattern recognition.To address this gap, we introduce MATHGLANCE, a benchmark specifically designed to isolate and evaluate mathematical perception in MLLMs.MATHGLANCE comprises 1.2K images and 1.6K carefully curated questions spanning four perception tasks: shape classification, object counting, relationship identification, and object grounding, covering diverse domains including plane geometry, solid geometry, and graphical representations.Our evaluation of MLLMs reveals that their ability to understand diagrams is notably limited, particularly in fine-grained grounding tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In response, we construct GeoPeP, a perception-oriented dataset of 200K structured geometry image-text pairs explicitly annotated with geometric primitives and precise spatial relationships. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.746</span></span>Training MLLM on GeoPeP leads to significant gains in perceptual accuracy, which in turn substantially improves mathematical reasoning.Our benchmark and dataset establish critical standards for evaluating and advancing multimodal mathematical understanding, providing valuable resources and insights to foster future MLLM research.</p>

                  <p>Segmentation is a fundamental task in computer vision, with prompt-driven methods gaining prominence due to their flexibility.The recent Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated powerful point-prompt segmentation capabilities, while text-based segmentation models offer rich semantic understanding.However, existing approaches rarely explore how to effectively combine these complementary modalities for optimal segmentation performance.This paper presents BiPrompt-SAM, a novel dual-modal prompt segmentation framework that fuses the advantages of point and text prompts through an explicit selection mechanism.Specifically, we leverage SAM's inherent ability to generate multiple mask candidates, combined with a semantic guidance mask from text prompts, and explicitly select the most suitable candidate based on similarity metrics.This approach can be viewed as a simplified Mixture of Experts (MoE) system, where the point and text modules act as distinct "experts," and the similarity scoring serves as a rudimentary "gating network."<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conducted extensive evaluations on both the Endovis17 medical dataset and RefCOCO series natural image datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.822</span></span>On Endovis17, BiPrompt-SAM achieved 89.55\% mDice and 81.46\% mIoU, comparable to state-of-the-art specialized medical segmentation models.On the RefCOCO series datasets, our method attained 87.1\%, 86.5\%, and 85.8\% IoU, significantly outperforming existing approaches.Experiments demonstrate that our explicit dual-selection method effectively combines the spatial precision of point prompts with the semantic richness of text prompts, particularly excelling in scenarios involving semantically complex objects, multiple similar objects, and partial occlusions.BiPrompt-SAM not only provides a simple yet effective implementation but also offers a new perspective on multi-modal prompt fusion.</p>

                  <p>Image geolocalization, in which, traditionally, an AI model predicts the precise GPS coordinates of an image is a challenging task with many downstream applications.However, the user cannot utilize the model to further their knowledge other than the GPS coordinate; the model lacks an understanding of the location and the conversational ability to communicate with the user.In recent days, with tremendous progress of large multimodal models (LMMs) proprietary and open-source researchers have attempted to geolocalize images via LMMs.However, the issues remain unaddressed; beyond general tasks, for more specialized downstream tasks, one of which is geolocalization, LMMs struggle.In this work, we propose to solve this problem by introducing a conversational model GAEA that can provide information regarding the location of an image, as required by a user.No large-scale dataset enabling the training of such a model exists.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Thus we propose a comprehensive dataset GAEA with 800K images and around 1.6M question answer pairs constructed by leveraging OpenStreetMap (OSM) attributes and geographical context clues. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.907</span></span>For quantitative evaluation, we propose a diverse benchmark comprising 4K image-text pairs to evaluate conversational capabilities equipped with diverse question types.We consider 11 state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary LMMs and demonstrate that GAEA significantly outperforms the best open-source model, LLaVA-OneVision by 25.69% and the best proprietary model, GPT-4o by 8.28%.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our dataset, model and codes are available <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.957</span></span></p>

                  <p>Repository-level code completion aims to complete code based on the long contexts of the repository.Existing studies extract long contexts from the repository as inputs and leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate code.However, we reveal a severe limitation of LLMs, i.e., LLMs may ignore the information within long contexts in code completion.In other words, even the contexts contain useful information (e.g., relevant APIs or similar code), LLMs may fail to utilize this information.We think this limitation is caused by an inherent bias in LLMs, i.e., relying on nearby contexts and ignoring long-range contexts.To address this, we propose a novel fine-tuning approach named CoLT.The core idea of CoLT is to provide explicit supervision signals, which emphasize that long-range contexts may hold relevant information.Specifically, CoLT proposes a reinforcement learning-based training, which explicitly encourages models to utilize the information within long contexts and punishes models for ignoring long contexts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To support CoLT, we release CoLT-132K, a large-scale dataset with 132k samples across four languages, each containing long-context inputs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.932</span></span>We apply CoLT to a popular LLM - aiXcoder-7B and release aiXcoder-7B-v2.We conduct extensive experiments on CoLT-132K and a public benchmark - CrossCodeEval.Our experiments yield the results: 1.Effectiveness.CoLT substantially improves aiXcoder-7B. aiXcoder-7B-v2 outperforms aiXcoder-7B by up to 44% in exact match.aiXcoder-7B-v2 becomes the state-of-the-art 7B model in code completion and even surpasses larger models.2. Generalizability.The capability learned by CoLT can generalize to new languages.Besides, CoLT is model-agnostic and effectively improves multiple LLMs.3. Enhanced Context Utilization Capability.CoLT significantly improves the capability of LLMs in utilizing the relevant information within long contexts.</p>

Our technical contributions are two-fold: first, we leverage resilience guarantees of Gaussians within the sum-of-squares framework.As a consequence, we obtain efficient sum-of-squares algorithms for regression with optimal robustness rates and sample complexity.Second, we generalize the recent robustness-to-privacy framework[HKMN23, (arXiv:2212.05015)] to account for the geometry induced by the covariance of the input samples.This framework crucially relies on the robust estimators to be sum-of-squares algorithms, and combining the two steps yields a sample-optimal private regression algorithm.We believe our techniques are of independent interest, and we demonstrate this by obtaining an efficient algorithm for covariance-aware mean estimation, with an optimal dependence on the privacy parameters.</p>

                  <p>To reduce the human intervention in the preference measure process,this article proposes a preference collaborative measure framework based on an updated belief system,which is also capable of improving the accuracy and efficiency of preferen-ce measure algorithms.Firstly,the distance of rules and the average internal distance of rulesets are proposed for specifying the relationship between the rules.For discovering the most representative preferences that are common in all users,namely common preference,a algorithm based on average internal distance of ruleset,PRA algorithm,is proposed,which aims to finish the discoveryprocess with minimum information loss rate.Furthermore,the concept of Common belief is proposed to update the belief system,and the common preferences are the evidences of updated belief system.Then,under the belief system,the proposed belief degree and deviation degree are used to determine whether a rule confirms the belief system or not and classify the preference rules into two kinds(generalized or personalized),and eventually filters out Top-K interesting rules relying on belief degree and deviation degree.Based on above,a scalable interestingness calculation framework that can apply various formulas is proposed for accurately calculating interestingness in different conditions.At last,IMCos algorithm and IMCov algorithm are proposed as exemplars to verify the accuracy and efficiency of the framework by using weighted cosine similarity and correlation coefficients as belief degree.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In experiments,the proposed algorithms are compared to two state-of-the-art algorithms and the results show that IMCos and IMCov outperform than the other two in most aspects. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.636</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent advances in DUSt3R have enabled robust estimation of dense point clouds and camera parameters of static scenes, leveraging Transformer network architectures and direct supervision on large-scale 3D datasets.In contrast, the limited scale and diversity of available 4D datasets present a major bottleneck for training a highly generalizable 4D model.This constraint has driven conventional 4D methods to fine-tune 3D models on scalable dynamic video data with additional geometric priors such as optical flow and depths.In this work, we take an opposite path and introduce Easi3R, a simple yet efficient training-free method for 4D reconstruction.Our approach applies attention adaptation during inference, eliminating the need for from-scratch pre-training or network fine-tuning.We find that the attention layers in DUSt3R inherently encode rich information about camera and object motion.By carefully disentangling these attention maps, we achieve accurate dynamic region segmentation, camera pose estimation, and 4D dense point map reconstruction.Extensive experiments on real-world dynamic videos demonstrate that our lightweight attention adaptation significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods that are trained or finetuned on extensive dynamic datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code is publicly available for research purpose at https://easi3r.github.io/ <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span></p>

                  <p>Accurate segmentation of cell nuclei in histopathology images is essential for numerous biomedical research and clinical applications.However, existing cell nucleus segmentation methods only consider a single dataset (i.e., primary domain), while neglecting to leverage supplementary data from diverse sources (i.e., auxiliary domains) to reduce overfitting and enhance the performance.Although incorporating multiple datasets could alleviate overfitting, it often exacerbates performance drops caused by domain shifts.In this work, we introduce Adversarial Multi-domain Alignment of Segment Anything Model (AMA-SAM) that extends the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to overcome these obstacles through two key innovations.First, we propose a Conditional Gradient Reversal Layer (CGRL), a multi-domain alignment module that harmonizes features from diverse domains to promote domain-invariant representation learning while preserving crucial discriminative features for the primary dataset.Second, we address SAM's inherent low-resolution output by designing a High-Resolution Decoder (HR-Decoder), which directly produces fine-grained segmentation maps in order to capture intricate nuclei boundaries in high-resolution histology images.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to adapt SAM for multi-dataset learning with application to histology nuclei segmentation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We validate our method on several publicly available datasets, demonstrating consistent and significant improvements over state-of-the-art approaches. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.645</span></span></p>

                  <p>Evaluating text-to-image synthesis is challenging due to misalignment between established metrics and human preferences.We propose cFreD, a metric based on the notion of Conditional Fr\'echet Distance that explicitly accounts for both visual fidelity and text-prompt alignment.Existing metrics such as Inception Score (IS), Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) and CLIPScore assess either image quality or image-text alignment but not both which limits their correlation with human preferences.Scoring models explicitly trained to replicate human preferences require constant updates and may not generalize to novel generation techniques or out-of-domain inputs.Through extensive experiments across multiple recently proposed text-to-image models and diverse prompt datasets, we demonstrate that cFreD exhibits a higher correlation with human judgments compared to statistical metrics, including metrics trained with human preferences.Our findings validate cFreD as a robust, future-proof metric for the systematic evaluation of text-to-image models, standardizing benchmarking in this rapidly evolving field.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We release our evaluation toolkit and benchmark in the appendix. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span></p>

                  <p>Ensuring the reliability and effectiveness of software release decisions is critical, particularly in safety-critical domains like automotive systems.Precise analysis of release validation data, often presented in tabular form, plays a pivotal role in this process.However, traditional methods that rely on manual analysis of extensive test datasets and validation metrics are prone to delays and high costs.Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative but face challenges in analytical reasoning, contextual understanding, handling out-of-scope queries, and processing structured test data consistently; limitations that hinder their direct application in safety-critical scenarios.This paper introduces GateLens, an LLM-based tool for analyzing tabular data in the automotive domain.GateLens translates natural language queries into Relational Algebra (RA) expressions and then generates optimized Python code.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It outperforms the baseline system on benchmarking datasets, achieving higher F1 scores and handling complex and ambiguous queries with greater robustness. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span>Ablation studies confirm the critical role of the RA module, with performance dropping sharply when omitted.Industrial evaluations reveal that GateLens reduces analysis time by over 80% while maintaining high accuracy and reliability.As demonstrated by presented results, GateLens achieved high performance without relying on few-shot examples, showcasing strong generalization across various query types from diverse company roles.Insights from deploying GateLens with a partner automotive company offer practical guidance for integrating AI into critical workflows such as release validation.Results show that by automating test result analysis, GateLens enables faster, more informed, and dependable release decisions, and can thus advance software scalability and reliability in automotive systems.</p>

                  <p>Recent pre-trained vision-language models (PT-VLMs) often face a Multi-Domain Class-Incremental Learning (MCIL) scenario in practice, where several classes and domains of multi-modal tasks are incrementally arrived.Without access to previously learned tasks and unseen tasks, memory-constrained MCIL suffers from forward and backward forgetting.To alleviate the above challenges, parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques (PEFT), such as prompt tuning, are employed to adapt the PT-VLM to the diverse incrementally learned tasks.To achieve effective new task adaptation, existing methods only consider the effect of PEFT strategy selection, but neglect the influence of PEFT parameter setting (e.g., prompting).In this paper, we tackle the challenge of optimizing prompt designs for diverse tasks in MCIL and propose an Instance-Aware Prompting (IAP) framework.Specifically, our Instance-Aware Gated Prompting (IA-GP) module enhances adaptation to new tasks while mitigating forgetting by dynamically assigning prompts across transformer layers at the instance level.Our Instance-Aware Class-Distribution-Driven Prompting (IA-CDDP) improves the task adaptation process by determining an accurate task-label-related confidence score for each instance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental evaluations across 11 datasets, using three performance metrics, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.696</span></span>Code can be found at https://github.com/FerdinandZJU/IAP.</p>

                  <p>Recently, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as a promising approach for robotic control.However, the deployment of DRL in real-world robots is hindered by its sensitivity to environmental perturbations.While existing whitebox adversarial attacks rely on local gradient information and apply uniform perturbations across all states to evaluate DRL robustness, they fail to account for temporal dynamics and state-specific vulnerabilities.To combat the above challenge, we first conduct a theoretical analysis of white-box attacks in DRL by establishing the adversarial victim-dynamics Markov decision process (AVD-MDP), to derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for a successful attack.Based on this, we propose a selective state-aware reinforcement adversarial attack method, named STAR, to optimize perturbation stealthiness and state visitation dispersion.STAR first employs a soft mask-based state-targeting mechanism to minimize redundant perturbations, enhancing stealthiness and attack effectiveness.Then, it incorporates an information-theoretic optimization objective to maximize mutual information between perturbations, environmental states, and victim actions, ensuring a dispersed state-visitation distribution that steers the victim agent into vulnerable states for maximum return reduction.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments demonstrate that STAR outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.665</span></span></p>

                  <p>Training deep neural networks (DNNs) is a structured optimization problem, because the parameters are naturally represented by matrices and tensors rather than simple vectors.Under this structural representation, it has been widely observed that gradients are low-rank and Hessians are approximately block-wise diagonal.These structured properties are crucial for designing efficient optimization algorithms but may not be utilized by current popular optimizers like Adam.In this paper, we present a novel optimization algorithm ASGO that capitalizes on these properties by employing a preconditioner that is adaptively updated using structured gradients.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By fine-grained theoretical analysis, ASGO is proven to achieve superior convergence rates compared to existing structured gradient methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.612</span></span>Based on the convergence theory, we further demonstrate that ASGO can benefit from the low-rank and block-wise diagonal properties.We also discuss practical modifications of ASGO and empirically verify the effectiveness of the algorithm on language model tasks.</p>

                  <p>Multimodal social interaction understanding (MMSI) is critical in human-robot interaction systems.In real-world scenarios, AI agents are required to provide real-time feedback.However, existing models often depend on both past and future contexts, which hinders them from applying to real-world problems.To bridge this gap, we propose an online MMSI setting, where the model must resolve MMSI tasks using only historical information, such as recorded dialogues and video streams.To address the challenges of missing the useful future context, we develop a novel framework, named Online-MMSI-VLM, that leverages two complementary strategies: multi-party conversation forecasting and social-aware visual prompting with multi-modal large language models.First, to enrich linguistic context, the multi-party conversation forecasting simulates potential future utterances in a coarse-to-fine manner, anticipating upcoming speaker turns and then generating fine-grained conversational details.Second, to effectively incorporate visual social cues like gaze and gesture, social-aware visual prompting highlights the social dynamics in video with bounding boxes and body keypoints for each person and frame.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on three tasks and two datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance and significantly outperforms baseline models, indicating its effectiveness on Online-MMSI. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.632</span></span>The code and pre-trained models will be publicly released at: https://github.com/Sampson-Lee/OnlineMMSI.</p>

                  <p>We address the problem of cluster identity estimation in a personalized federated learning (PFL) setting in which users aim to learn different personal models.The backbone of effective learning in such a setting is to cluster users into groups whose objectives are similar.A typical approach in the literature is to achieve this by training users' data on different proposed personal models and assign them to groups based on which model achieves the lowest value of the users' loss functions.This process is to be done iteratively until group identities converge.A key challenge in such a setting arises when users have noisy labeled data, which may produce misleading values of their loss functions, and hence lead to ineffective clustering.To overcome this challenge, we propose a label-agnostic data similarity-based clustering algorithm, coined RCC-PFL, with three main advantages: the cluster identity estimation procedure is independent from the training labels; it is a one-shot clustering algorithm performed prior to the training; and it requires fewer communication rounds and less computation compared to iterative-based clustering methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We validate our proposed algorithm using various models and datasets and show that it outperforms multiple baselines in terms of average accuracy and variance reduction. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.763</span></span></p>

                  <p>Fuzzing is a well-established technique for detecting bugs and vulnerabilities.With the surge of fuzzers and fuzzer platforms being developed such as AFL and OSSFuzz rises the necessity to benchmark these tools' performance.A common problem is that vulnerability benchmarks are based on bugs in old software releases.For this very reason, Magma introduced the notion of forward-porting to reintroduce vulnerable code in current software releases.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While their results are promising, the state-of-the-art lacks an update on the maintainability of this approach over time. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span>Indeed, adding the vulnerable code to a recent software version might either break its functionality or make the vulnerable code no longer reachable.We characterise the challenges with forward-porting by reassessing the portability of Magma's CVEs four years after its release and manually reintroducing the vulnerabilities in the current software versions.We find the straightforward process efficient for 17 of the 32 CVEs in our study.We further investigate why a trivial forward-porting process fails in the 15 other CVEs.This involves identifying the commits breaking the forward-porting process and reverting them in addition to the bug fix.While we manage to complete the process for nine of these CVEs, we provide an update on all 15 and explain the challenges we have been confronted with in this process.Thereby, we give the basis for future work towards a sustainable forward-ported fuzzing benchmark.</p>

                  <p>Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) is a complex task that aims to retrieve images based on a multimodal query.Typical training data consists of triplets containing a reference image, a textual description of desired modifications, and the target image, which are expensive and time-consuming to acquire.The scarcity of CIR datasets has led to zero-shot approaches utilizing synthetic triplets or leveraging vision-language models (VLMs) with ubiquitous web-crawled image-caption pairs.However, these methods have significant limitations: synthetic triplets suffer from limited scale, lack of diversity, and unnatural modification text, while image-caption pairs hinder joint embedding learning of the multimodal query due to the absence of triplet data.Moreover, existing approaches struggle with complex and nuanced modification texts that demand sophisticated fusion and understanding of vision and language modalities.We present CoLLM, a one-stop framework that effectively addresses these limitations.Our approach generates triplets on-the-fly from image-caption pairs, enabling supervised training without manual annotation.We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate joint embeddings of reference images and modification texts, facilitating deeper multimodal fusion.Additionally, we introduce Multi-Text CIR (MTCIR), a large-scale dataset comprising 3.4M samples, and refine existing CIR benchmarks (CIRR and Fashion-IQ) to enhance evaluation reliability.Experimental results demonstrate that CoLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple CIR benchmarks and settings.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>MTCIR yields competitive results, with up to 15% performance improvement. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.645</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our refined benchmarks provide more reliable evaluation metrics for CIR models, contributing to the advancement of this important field. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.687</span></span></p>

                  <p>In this work, we aim to compress the vision tokens of a Large Vision Language Model (LVLM) into a representation that is simultaneously suitable for (a) generative and (b) discriminative tasks, (c) is nearly lossless, and (d) is storage-efficient.We propose a novel compression approach, called Fwd2Bot, that uses the LVLM itself to compress the visual information in a task-agnostic manner.At the core of Fwd2bot there exists a "double-forward pass" training strategy, whereby, during the first forward pass, the LLM (of the LVLM) creates a bottleneck by condensing the visual information into a small number of summary tokens.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Then, using the same LLM, the second forward pass processes the language instruction(s) alongside the summary tokens, used as a direct replacement for the image ones. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.699</span></span>The training signal is provided by two losses: an autoregressive one applied after the second pass that provides a direct optimization objective for compression, and a contrastive loss, applied after the first pass, that further boosts the representation strength, especially for discriminative tasks.The training is further enhanced by stage-specific adapters.We accompany the proposed method by an in-depth ablation study.Overall, Fwd2Bot results in highly-informative compressed representations suitable for both generative and discriminative tasks.For generative tasks, we offer a 2x higher compression rate without compromising the generative capabilities, setting a new state-of-the-art result.For discriminative tasks, we set a new state-of-the-art on image retrieval and compositionality.</p>
