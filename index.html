                  <p>When reading a document, glancing at the spatial layout of a document is an initial step to understand it roughly.Traditional document layout analysis (DLA) methods, however, offer only a superficial parsing of documents, focusing on basic instance detection and often failing to capture the nuanced spatial and logical relations between instances.These limitations hinder DLA-based models from achieving a gradually deeper comprehension akin to human reading.In this work, we propose a novel graph-based Document Structure Analysis (gDSA) task.This task requires that model not only detects document elements but also generates spatial and logical relations in form of a graph structure, allowing to understand documents in a holistic and intuitive manner.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For this new task, we construct a relation graph-based document structure analysis dataset (GraphDoc) with 80K document images and 4.13M relation annotations, enabling training models to complete multiple tasks like reading order, hierarchical structures analysis, and complex inter-element relation inference. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.758</span></span>Furthermore, a document relation graph generator (DRGG) is proposed to address the gDSA task, which achieves performance with 57.6% at mAP$_g$@0.5 for a strong benchmark baseline on this novel task and dataset.We hope this graphical representation of document structure can mark an innovative advancement in document structure analysis and understanding.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The new dataset and code will be made publicly available at https://yufanchen96.github.io/projects/GraphDoc. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.872</span></span></p>

                  <p>Language agents have become a promising solution to complex interactive tasks.One of the key ingredients to the success of language agents is the reward model on the trajectory of the agentic workflow, which provides valuable guidance during training or inference.However, due to the lack of annotations of intermediate interactions, most existing works use an outcome reward model to optimize policies across entire trajectories.This may lead to sub-optimal policies and hinder the overall performance.To address this, we propose QLASS (Q-guided Language Agent Stepwise Search), to automatically generate annotations by estimating Q-values in a stepwise manner for open language agents.By introducing a reasoning tree and performing process reward modeling, QLASS provides effective intermediate guidance for each step.With the stepwise guidance, we propose a Q-guided generation strategy to enable language agents to better adapt to long-term value, resulting in significant performance improvement during model inference on complex interactive agent tasks.Notably, even with almost half the annotated data, QLASS retains strong performance, demonstrating its efficiency in handling limited supervision.We also empirically demonstrate that QLASS can lead to more effective decision making through qualitative analysis.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We will release our code and data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.87</span></span></p>

                  <p>Real-world open-domain questions can be complicated, particularly when answering them involves information from multiple information sources.LLMs have demonstrated impressive performance in decomposing complex tasks into simpler steps, and previous work has used it for better retrieval in support of complex questions.However, LLM's decomposition of questions is unaware of what data is available and how data is organized, often leading to a sub-optimal retrieval performance.Recent effort in agentic RAG proposes to perform retrieval in an iterative fashion, where a followup query is derived as an action based on previous rounds of retrieval.While this provides one way of interacting with the data collection, agentic RAG's exploration of data is inefficient because successive queries depend on previous results rather than being guided by the organization of available data in the collection.To address this problem, we propose an LLM-based retrieval method -- ARM, that aims to better align the question with the organization of the data collection by exploring relationships among data objects beyond matching the utterance of the query, thus leading to a retrieve-all-at-once solution for complex queries.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluated ARM on two datasets, Bird and OTT-QA. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.727</span></span>On Bird, it outperforms standard RAG with query decomposition by up to 5.2 pt in execution accuracy and agentic RAG (ReAct) by up to 15.9 pt.On OTT-QA, it achieves up to 5.5 pt and 19.3 pt higher F1 match scores compared to these approaches.</p>

                  <p>Fixing Python dependency issues is a tedious and error-prone task for developers, who must manually identify and resolve environment dependencies and version constraints of third-party modules and Python interpreters.Researchers have attempted to automate this process by relying on large knowledge graphs and database lookup tables.However, these traditional approaches face limitations due to the variety of dependency error types, large sets of possible module versions, and conflicts among transitive dependencies.This study explores the potential of using large language models (LLMs) to automatically fix dependency issues in Python programs.We introduce PLLM (pronounced "plum"), a novel technique that employs retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to help an LLM infer Python versions and required modules for a given Python file.PLLM builds a testing environment that iteratively (1) prompts the LLM for module combinations, (2) tests the suggested changes, and (3) provides feedback (error messages) to the LLM to refine the fix.This feedback cycle leverages natural language processing (NLP) to intelligently parse and interpret build error messages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We benchmark PLLM on the Gistable HG2.9K dataset, a collection of challenging single-file Python gists. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.781</span></span>We compare PLLM against two state-of-the-art automatic dependency inference approaches, namely PyEGo and ReadPyE, w.r.t.the ability to resolve dependency issues.Our results indicate that PLLM can fix more dependency issues than the two baselines, with +218 (+15.97%) more fixes over ReadPyE and +281 (+21.58%) over PyEGo.Our deeper analyses suggest that PLLM is particularly beneficial for projects with many dependencies and for specific third-party numerical and machine-learning modules.Our findings demonstrate the potential of LLM-based approaches to iteratively resolve Python dependency issues.</p>

                  <p>The research in AI-based formal mathematical reasoning has shown an unstoppable growth trend.These studies have excelled in mathematical competitions like IMO, showing significant progress.However, these studies intertwined multiple skills simultaneously, i.e., problem-solving, reasoning, and writing formal specifications, making it hard to precisely identify the LLMs' strengths and weaknesses in each task.This paper focuses on formal verification, an immediate application scenario of formal reasoning, and decomposes it into six sub-tasks.We constructed 18k high-quality instruction-response pairs across five mainstream formal specification languages (Coq, Lean4, Dafny, ACSL, and TLA+) in six formal-verification-related tasks by distilling GPT-4o.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>They are split into a 14k+ fine-tuning dataset FM-alpaca and a 4k benchmark FM-Bench. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.761</span></span>We found that LLMs are good at writing proof segments when given either the code, or the detailed description of proof steps.Also, the fine-tuning brought about a nearly threefold improvement at most.Interestingly, we observed that fine-tuning with formal data also enhances mathematics, reasoning, and coding abilities.We hope our findings inspire further research.Fine-tuned models are released to facilitate subsequent studies</p>

                  <p>Recent advances in large multimodal models (LMMs) have recognized fine-grained grounding as an imperative factor of visual understanding and dialogue.However, the benefits of such representation in LMMs are limited to the natural image domain, and these models perform poorly for remote sensing (RS).The distinct overhead viewpoint, scale variation, and presence of small objects in high-resolution RS imagery present a unique challenge in region-level comprehension.Moreover, the development of the grounding conversation capability of LMMs within RS is hindered by the lack of granular, RS domain-specific grounded data.Addressing these limitations, we propose GeoPixel - the first end-to-end high resolution RS-LMM that supports pixel-level grounding.This capability allows fine-grained visual perception by generating interleaved masks in conversation.GeoPixel supports up to 4K HD resolution in any aspect ratio, ideal for high-precision RS image analysis.To support the grounded conversation generation (GCG) in RS imagery, we curate a visually grounded dataset GeoPixelD through a semi-automated pipeline that utilizes set-of-marks prompting and spatial priors tailored for RS data to methodically control the data generation process.GeoPixel demonstrates superior performance in pixel-level comprehension, surpassing existing LMMs in both single-target and multi-target segmentation tasks.Our methodological ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each component in the overall architecture.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and data will be publicly released. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.826</span></span></p>

                  <p>Identifying anatomical landmarks in 3D dental models is crucial for orthodontic treatment.Manually placing these key points is complex, time-consuming, and requires expert knowledge.While some machine learning methods have been proposed for automatic tooth landmark detection in 3D Intraoral Scans (IOS), research remains limited, with no fully end-to-end approaches that avoid teeth segmentation.   We propose CHaRNet (Conditioned Heatmap Regression Network), the first end-to-end deep learning method for tooth landmark detection in 3D IOS.Unlike traditional two-stage methods that segment teeth before detecting landmarks, CHaRNet directly detects landmarks on the input point cloud.It consists of four key modules: (1) a point cloud encoder, (2) a point cloud decoder with a heatmap regression head, (3) a teeth presence classification head, and (4) the innovative Conditioned Heatmap Regression (CHaR) module.The CHaR module refines landmark regression by leveraging teeth presence classification, enabling dynamic adaptation to cases with missing teeth and improving accuracy in complex dental models.   We evaluate CHaRNet using five point cloud learning algorithms to validate the effectiveness of the CHaR module and test it on a clinical dataset of $1,214$ annotated 3D dental models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Both the dataset and code will be publicly released to address the lack of open datasets in orthodontics, promote benchmarking, and inspire new research.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.712</span></span>CHaRNet achieves a Mean Euclidean Distance Error (MEDE) of 1.28 mm and a Mean Success Ratio (MSR) of 82.40\%, demonstrating robust performance.Notably, it excels in handling irregular dental geometries, such as models with missing teeth.This end-to-end approach streamlines orthodontic workflows, improves 3D IOS analysis precision, and facilitates efficient computer-assisted treatment planning.</p>

                  <p>Often software engineering classes have the student concentrate on designing and planning the project but stop short of actual student team development of code.This leads to criticism by employers of new graduates that they are missing skills in working in teams and coordinating multiple overlapping changes to a code base.Additionally, students that are not actively experiencing team development are unprepared to understand and modify existing legacy-code bases written by others.This paper presents a new approach to teaching undergraduate software engineering that emphasizes not only software engineering methodology but also experiencing development as a member of a team and modifying a legacy code base.Our innovative software engineering course begins with learning the fundamentals of software engineering, followed by examining an existing framework of a social media application.The students are then grouped into multiple software teams, each focusing on a different aspect of the app.The separate teams must define requirements, design, and provide documentation on the services.Using an Agile development approach, the teams incrementally add to the code base and demonstrate features as the application evolves.Subsequent iterations of the class pick up the prior students code base, providing experience working with a legacy code base.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Preliminary results of using this approach at the university are presented in this paper including quantitative analysis. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.633</span></span>Analysis of student software submissions to the cloud-based code repository shows student engagement and contributions over the span of the course.Positive student evaluations show the effectiveness of applying the principles of software engineering to the development of a complex solution in a team environment.Keywords: Software engineering, teaching, college computer science, innovative methods, agile.</p>

                  <p>Fuzzy rough set theory is effective for processing datasets with complex attributes, supported by a solid mathematical foundation and closely linked to kernel methods in machine learning.Attribute reduction algorithms and classifiers based on fuzzy rough set theory exhibit promising performance in the analysis of high-dimensional multivariate complex data.However, most existing models operate at the finest granularity, rendering them inefficient and sensitive to noise, especially for high-dimensional big data.Thus, enhancing the robustness of fuzzy rough set models is crucial for effective feature selection.Muiti-garanularty granular-ball computing, a recent development, uses granular-balls of different sizes to adaptively represent and cover the sample space, performing learning based on these granular-balls.This paper proposes integrating multi-granularity granular-ball computing into fuzzy rough set theory, using granular-balls to replace sample points.The coarse-grained characteristics of granular-balls make the model more robust.Additionally, we propose a new method for generating granular-balls, scalable to the entire supervised method based on granular-ball computing.A forward search algorithm is used to select feature sequences by defining the correlation between features and categories through dependence functions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments demonstrate the proposed model's effectiveness and superiority over baseline methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.725</span></span></p>

                  <p>Predicting molecular properties is essential for drug discovery, and computational methods can greatly enhance this process.Molecular graphs have become a focus for representation learning, with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) widely used.However, GNNs often struggle with capturing long-range dependencies.To address this, we propose MolGraph-xLSTM, a novel graph-based xLSTM model that enhances feature extraction and effectively models molecule long-range interactions.   Our approach processes molecular graphs at two scales: atom-level and motif-level.For atom-level graphs, a GNN-based xLSTM framework with jumping knowledge extracts local features and aggregates multilayer information to capture both local and global patterns effectively.Motif-level graphs provide complementary structural information for a broader molecular view.Embeddings from both scales are refined via a multi-head mixture of experts (MHMoE), further enhancing expressiveness and performance.   We validate MolGraph-xLSTM on 10 molecular property prediction datasets, covering both classification and regression tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our model demonstrates consistent performance across all datasets, with improvements of up to 7.03% on the BBBP dataset for classification and 7.54% on the ESOL dataset for regression compared to baselines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span>On average, MolGraph-xLSTM achieves an AUROC improvement of 3.18\% for classification tasks and an RMSE reduction of 3.83\% across regression datasets compared to the baseline methods.These results confirm the effectiveness of our model, offering a promising solution for molecular representation learning for drug discovery.</p>

                  <p>Real-world open-domain questions can be complicated, particularly when answering them involves information from multiple information sources.LLMs have demonstrated impressive performance in decomposing complex tasks into simpler steps, and previous work has used it for better retrieval in support of complex questions.However, LLM's decomposition of questions is unaware of what data is available and how data is organized, often leading to a sub-optimal retrieval performance.Recent effort in agentic RAG proposes to perform retrieval in an iterative fashion, where a followup query is derived as an action based on previous rounds of retrieval.While this provides one way of interacting with the data collection, agentic RAG's exploration of data is inefficient because successive queries depend on previous results rather than being guided by the organization of available data in the collection.To address this problem, we propose an LLM-based retrieval method -- ARM, that aims to better align the question with the organization of the data collection by exploring relationships among data objects beyond matching the utterance of the query, thus leading to a retrieve-all-at-once solution for complex queries.We evaluated ARM on two datasets, Bird and OTT-QA.On Bird, it outperforms standard RAG with query decomposition by up to 5.2 pt in execution accuracy and agentic RAG (ReAct) by up to 15.9 pt.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>On OTT-QA, it achieves up to 5.5 pt and 19.3 pt higher F1 match scores compared to these approaches. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span></p>

                  <p>As one of the most promising methods in self-supervised learning, contrastive learning has achieved a series of breakthroughs across numerous fields.A predominant approach to implementing contrastive learning is applying InfoNCE loss: By capturing the similarities between pairs, InfoNCE loss enables learning the representation of data.Albeit its success, adopting InfoNCE loss requires tuning a temperature, which is a core hyperparameter for calibrating similarity scores.Despite its significance and sensitivity to performance being emphasized by several studies, searching for a valid temperature requires extensive trial-and-error-based experiments, which increases the difficulty of adopting InfoNCE loss.To address this difficulty, we propose a novel method to deploy InfoNCE loss without temperature.Specifically, we replace temperature scaling with the inverse hyperbolic tangent function, resulting in a modified InfoNCE loss.In addition to hyperparameter-free deployment, we observed that the proposed method even yielded a performance gain in contrastive learning.Our detailed theoretical analysis discovers that the current practice of temperature scaling in InfoNCE loss causes serious problems in gradient descent, whereas our method provides desirable gradient properties.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The proposed method was validated on five benchmarks on contrastive learning, yielding satisfactory results without temperature tuning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span></p>

                  <p>Answering questions that require reasoning and aggregation across both structured (tables) and unstructured (raw text) data sources presents significant challenges.Current methods rely on fine-tuning and high-quality, human-curated data, which is difficult to obtain.Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising results for multi-hop question answering (QA) over single-source text data in a zero-shot setting, yet exploration into multi-source Table-Text QA remains limited.In this paper, we present a novel Hybrid Graph-based approach for Table-Text QA that leverages LLMs without fine-tuning.Our method constructs a unified Hybrid Graph from textual and tabular data, pruning information based on the input question to provide the LLM with relevant context concisely.We evaluate our approach on the challenging Hybrid-QA and OTT-QA datasets using state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and LLaMA-3.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our method achieves the best zero-shot performance on both datasets, improving Exact Match scores by up to 10% on Hybrid-QA and 5.4% on OTT-QA. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.617</span></span>Moreover, our approach reduces token usage by up to 53% compared to the original context.</p>

                  <p>In Production Scheduling, the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSSP) aims to optimize a sequence of operations and assign each to an eligible machine with varying processing times.For integration of the workforce, each machine also requires a worker to be present to process an operation which additionally affects the processing times.The resulting problem is called Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem with Worker Flexibility (FJSSP-W).The FJSSP has been approached with various problem representations, including Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP), Constrained Programming (CP), and Simulation-based Optimization (SBO).In the latter area in particular, there exists a large number of specialized Evolutionary Algorithms (EA) like Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) or Genetic Algorithms (GA).Yet, the solvers are often developed for single use cases only, and validated on a few selected test instances, let alone compared with results from solvers using other problem representations.While suitable approaches do also exist, the design of the FJSSP-W instances is not standardized and the algorithms are hardly comparable.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This calls for a systematic benchmarking environment that provides a comprehensive set of FJSSP(-W) instances and supports targeted algorithm development. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.629</span></span>It will facilitate the comparison of algorithmic performance in the face of different problem characteristics.The present paper presents a collection of 402 commonly accepted FJSSP instances and proposes an approach to extend these with worker flexibility.In addition, we present a detailed procedure for the evaluation of scheduling algorithms on these problem sets and provide suitable model representations for this purpose.We provide complexity characteristics for all presented instances as well as baseline results of common commercial solvers to facilitate the validation of new algorithmic developments.</p>

                  <p>Source camera identification has emerged as a vital solution to unlock incidents involving critical cases like terrorism, violence, and other criminal activities.The ability to trace the origin of an image/video can aid law enforcement agencies in gathering evidence and constructing the timeline of events.Moreover, identifying the owner of a certain device narrows down the area of search in a criminal investigation where smartphone devices are involved.This paper proposes a new pixel-based method for source camera identification, integrating Pixel Difference Convolution (PDC) with a Vision Transformer network (ViT), and named PDC-ViT.While the PDC acts as the backbone for feature extraction by exploiting Angular PDC (APDC) and Radial PDC (RPDC).These techniques enhance the capability to capture subtle variations in pixel information, which are crucial for distinguishing between different source cameras.The second part of the methodology focuses on classification, which is based on a Vision Transformer network.Unlike traditional methods that utilize image patches directly for training the classification network, the proposed approach uniquely inputs PDC features into the Vision Transformer network.To demonstrate the effectiveness of the PDC-ViT approach, it has been assessed on five different datasets, which include various image contents and video scenes.The method has also been compared with state-of-the-art source camera identification methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed system in terms of accuracy and robustness when compared to its competitors. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.675</span></span>For example, our proposed PDC-ViT has achieved an accuracy of 94.30%, 84%, 94.22% and 92.29% using the Vision dataset, Daxing dataset, Socrates dataset and QUFVD dataset, respectively.</p>

                  <p>The compact genetic algorithm (cGA) is one of the simplest estimation-of-distribution algorithms (EDAs).Next to the univariate marginal distribution algorithm (UMDA) -- another simple EDA -- , the cGA has been subject to extensive mathematical runtime analyses, often showcasing a similar or even superior performance to competing approaches.Surprisingly though, up to date and in contrast to the UMDA and many other heuristics, we lack a rigorous runtime analysis of the cGA on the LeadingOnes benchmark -- one of the most studied theory benchmarks in the domain of evolutionary computation.   We fill this gap in the literature by conducting a formal runtime analysis of the cGA on LeadingOnes.For the cGA's single parameter -- called the hypothetical population size -- at least polylogarithmically larger than the problem size, we prove that the cGA samples the optimum of LeadingOnes with high probability within a number of function evaluations quasi-linear in the problem size and linear in the hypothetical population size.For the best hypothetical population size, our result matches, up to polylogarithmic factors, the typical quadratic runtime that many randomized search heuristics exhibit on LeadingOnes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our analysis exhibits some noteworthy differences in the working principles of the two algorithms which were not visible in previous works. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.691</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in fields such as automotive and aerospace have driven a growing demand for robust computational resources.Applications that were once designed for basic MCUs are now deployed on highly heterogeneous SoC platforms.While these platforms deliver the necessary computational performance, they also present challenges related to resource sharing and predictability.These challenges are particularly pronounced when consolidating safety and non-safety-critical systems, the so-called Mixed-Criticality Systems (MCS) to adhere to strict SWaP-C requirements.MCS consolidation on shared platforms requires stringent spatial and temporal isolation to comply with functional safety standards.Virtualization, mainly leveraged by hypervisors, is a key technology that ensures spatial isolation across multiple OSes and applications; however, ensuring temporal isolation remains challenging due to contention on shared hardwar resources, which impacts real-time performance and predictability.To mitigate this problem, several strategies as cache coloring and memory bandwidth reservation have been proposed.Although cache coloring is typically implemented on state-of-the-art hypervisors, memory bandwidth reservation approaches are commonly implemented at the Linux kernel level or rely on dedicated hardware and typically do not consider the concept of VMs that can run different OSes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To fill the gap between current memory bandwidth reservation solutions and the deployment of MCSs that operate on a hypervisor, this work introduces H-MBR, an open-source VM-centric memory bandwidth reservation mechanism. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span>H-MBR features (i) VM-centric bandwidth reservation, (ii) OS and platform agnosticism, and (iii) reduced overhead.Empirical results evidenced no overhead on non-regulated workloads, and negligible overhead (<1%) for regulated workloads for regulation periods of 2 us or higher.</p>

                  <p>The discovery of new materials is essential for enabling technological advancements.Computational approaches for predicting novel materials must effectively learn the manifold of stable crystal structures within an infinite design space.We introduce Open Materials Generation (OMG), a unifying framework for the generative design and discovery of inorganic crystalline materials.OMG employs stochastic interpolants (SI) to bridge an arbitrary base distribution to the target distribution of inorganic crystals via a broad class of tunable stochastic processes, encompassing both diffusion models and flow matching as special cases.In this work, we adapt the SI framework by integrating an equivariant graph representation of crystal structures and extending it to account for periodic boundary conditions in unit cell representations.Additionally, we couple the SI flow over spatial coordinates and lattice vectors with discrete flow matching for atomic species.We benchmark OMG's performance on two tasks: Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP) for specified compositions, and 'de novo' generation (DNG) aimed at discovering stable, novel, and unique structures.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In our ground-up implementation of OMG, we refine and extend both CSP and DNG metrics compared to previous works. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span>OMG establishes a new state-of-the-art in generative modeling for materials discovery, outperforming purely flow-based and diffusion-based implementations.These results underscore the importance of designing flexible deep learning frameworks to accelerate progress in materials science.</p>

                  <p>The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 with Extended Reality (XR) technologies offers the potential to build truly immersive XR environments that interact with human users through natural language, e.g., generating and animating 3D scenes from audio inputs.However, the complexity of XR environments makes it difficult to accurately extract relevant contextual data and scene/object parameters from an overwhelming volume of XR artifacts.It leads to not only increased costs with pay-per-use models, but also elevated levels of generation errors.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, existing approaches focusing on coding script generation are often prone to generation errors, resulting in flawed or invalid scripts, application crashes, and ultimately a degraded user experience. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.64</span></span>To overcome these challenges, we introduce LLMER, a novel framework that creates interactive XR worlds using JSON data generated by LLMs.Unlike prior approaches focusing on coding script generation, LLMER translates natural language inputs into JSON data, significantly reducing the likelihood of application crashes and processing latency.It employs a multi-stage strategy to supply only the essential contextual information adapted to the user's request and features multiple modules designed for various XR tasks.Our preliminary user study reveals the effectiveness of the proposed system, with over 80% reduction in consumed tokens and around 60% reduction in task completion time compared to state-of-the-art approaches.The analysis of users' feedback also illuminates a series of directions for further optimization.</p>
