                  <p>Existing plant disease classification models have achieved remarkable performance in recognizing in-laboratory diseased images.However, their performance often significantly degrades in classifying in-the-wild images.Furthermore, we observed that in-the-wild plant images may exhibit similar appearances across various diseases (i.e., small inter-class discrepancy) while the same diseases may look quite different (i.e., large intra-class variance).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Motivated by this observation, we propose an in-the-wild multimodal plant disease recognition dataset that contains the largest number of disease classes but also text-based descriptions for each disease. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.785</span></span>Particularly, the newly provided text descriptions are introduced to provide rich information in textual modality and facilitate in-the-wild disease classification with small inter-class discrepancy and large intra-class variance issues.Therefore, our proposed dataset can be regarded as an ideal testbed for evaluating disease recognition methods in the real world.In addition, we further present a strong yet versatile baseline that models text descriptions and visual data through multiple prototypes for a given class.By fusing the contributions of multimodal prototypes in classification, our baseline can effectively address the small inter-class discrepancy and large intra-class variance issues.Remarkably, our baseline model can not only classify diseases but also recognize diseases in few-shot or training-free scenarios.Extensive benchmarking results demonstrate that our proposed in-the-wild multimodal dataset sets many new challenges to the plant disease recognition task and there is a large space to improve for future works.</p>

                  <p>Federated learning is a promising distributed machine learning paradigm that can effectively exploit large-scale data without exposing users' privacy.However, it may incur significant communication overhead, thereby potentially impairing the training efficiency.To address this challenge, numerous studies suggest binarizing the model updates.Nonetheless, traditional methods usually binarize model updates in a post-training manner, resulting in significant approximation errors and consequent degradation in model accuracy.To this end, we propose Federated Binarization-Aware Training (FedBAT), a novel framework that directly learns binary model updates during the local training process, thus inherently reducing the approximation errors.FedBAT incorporates an innovative binarization operator, along with meticulously designed derivatives to facilitate efficient learning.In addition, we establish theoretical guarantees regarding the convergence of FedBAT.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments are conducted on four popular datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.702</span></span>The results show that FedBAT significantly accelerates the convergence and exceeds the accuracy of baselines by up to 9\%, even surpassing that of FedAvg in some cases.</p>

                  <p>The Rust programming language has garnered significant attention due to its robust safety features and memory management capabilities.Despite its guaranteed memory safety, Rust programs still suffer from runtime errors that are unmanageable, i.e., panic errors.Notably, over half of the bugs in rustc, Rust's own compiler, are attributable to crash stemming from panic errors.However, understanding root causes and resolving these panics often requires substantial effort due to the limited information provided, and the stack backtrace could be intricate, often omitting the actual fault locations.Although numerous automated program repair techniques exist, we observe that the prevailing fix patterns do not readily apply to Rust programs due to natural differences in language mechanisms.To tackle the above challenges, this paper introduces a systematic study aimed at fixing Rust panic bugs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We commence by assembling a dataset, namely Panic4R, which includes 102 real panic bugs and their fixes from the top 500 most downloaded open-source crates. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.861</span></span>By analyzing Rust's implementation, we identify Rust-specific patterns for fixing panic bugs, which can aid in understanding and providing guidance for generating patches.Finally, we design and implement the first automated fixing tool, PanicKiller, for Rust panic bugs, which effectively generates correct patches on the real-world large-scale dataset, and has already assisted in the resolution of 28 panic bugs in open-source projects.Each resolved issue has been validated by the developers and merged into the respective codebases.</p>

                  <p>This paper studies zero-shot object recognition using event camera data.Guided by CLIP, which is pre-trained on RGB images, existing approaches achieve zero-shot object recognition by maximizing embedding similarities between event data encoded by an event encoder and RGB images encoded by the CLIP image encoder.Alternatively, several methods learn RGB frame reconstructions from event data for the CLIP image encoder.However, these approaches often result in suboptimal zero-shot performance.   This study develops an event encoder without relying on additional reconstruction networks.We theoretically analyze the performance bottlenecks of previous approaches: global similarity-based objective (i.e., maximizing the embedding similarities) cause semantic misalignments between the learned event embedding space and the CLIP text embedding space due to the degree of freedom.To mitigate the issue, we explore a scalar-wise regularization strategy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, to scale up the number of events and RGB data pairs for training, we also propose a pipeline for synthesizing event data from static RGB images.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.752</span></span>Experimentally, our data synthesis strategy exhibits an attractive scaling property, and our method achieves superior zero-shot object recognition performance on extensive standard benchmark datasets, even compared with past supervised learning approaches.For example, we achieve 47.84% zero-shot accuracy on the N-ImageNet dataset.</p>

                  <p>Task-specific data-fusion networks have marked considerable achievements in urban scene parsing.Among these networks, our recently proposed RoadFormer successfully extracts heterogeneous features from RGB images and surface normal maps and fuses these features through attention mechanisms, demonstrating compelling efficacy in RGB-Normal road scene parsing.However, its performance significantly deteriorates when handling other types/sources of data or performing more universal, all-category scene parsing tasks.To overcome these limitations, this study introduces RoadFormer+, an efficient, robust, and adaptable model capable of effectively fusing RGB-X data, where ``X'', represents additional types/modalities of data such as depth, thermal, surface normal, and polarization.Specifically, we propose a novel hybrid feature decoupling encoder to extract heterogeneous features and decouple them into global and local components.These decoupled features are then fused through a dual-branch multi-scale heterogeneous feature fusion block, which employs parallel Transformer attentions and convolutional neural network modules to merge multi-scale features across different scales and receptive fields.The fused features are subsequently fed into a decoder to generate the final semantic predictions.Notably, our proposed RoadFormer+ ranks first on the KITTI Road benchmark and achieves state-of-the-art performance in mean intersection over union on the Cityscapes, MFNet, FMB, and ZJU datasets.Moreover, it reduces the number of learnable parameters by 65\% compared to RoadFormer.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our source code will be publicly available at mias.group/RoadFormerPlus. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.715</span></span></p>

                  <p>Epitope identification is vital for antibody design yet challenging due to the inherent variability in antibodies.While many deep learning methods have been developed for general protein binding site prediction tasks, whether they work for epitope prediction remains an understudied research question.The challenge is also heightened by the lack of a consistent evaluation pipeline with sufficient dataset size and epitope diversity.We introduce a filtered antibody-antigen complex structure dataset, AsEP (Antibody-specific Epitope Prediction).AsEP is the largest of its kind and provides clustered epitope groups, allowing the community to develop and test novel epitope prediction methods.AsEP comes with an easy-to-use interface in Python and pre-built graph representations of each antibody-antigen complex while also supporting customizable embedding methods.Based on this new dataset, we benchmarked various representative general protein-binding site prediction methods and find that their performances are not satisfactory as expected for epitope prediction.We thus propose a new method, WALLE, that leverages both protein language models and graph neural networks.WALLE demonstrate about 5X performance gain over existing methods.Our empirical findings evidence that epitope prediction benefits from combining sequential embeddings provided by language models and geometrical information from graph representations, providing a guideline for future method design.In addition, we reformulate the task as bipartite link prediction, allowing easy model performance attribution and interpretability.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We open-source our data and code at https://github.com/biochunan/AsEP-dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.816</span></span></p>

                  <p>Contrastive Language Image Pre-training (CLIP) has recently demonstrated success across various tasks due to superior feature representation empowered by image-text contrastive learning.However, the instance discrimination method used by CLIP can hardly encode the semantic structure of training data.To handle this limitation, cluster discrimination has been proposed through iterative cluster assignment and classification.Nevertheless, most cluster discrimination approaches only define a single pseudo-label for each image, neglecting multi-label signals in the image.In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-Label Cluster Discrimination method named MLCD to enhance representation learning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In the clustering step, we first cluster the large-scale LAION-400M dataset into one million centers based on off-the-shelf embedding features. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.719</span></span>Considering that natural images frequently contain multiple visual objects or attributes, we select the multiple closest centers as auxiliary class labels.In the discrimination step, we design a novel multi-label classification loss, which elegantly separates losses from positive classes and negative classes, and alleviates ambiguity on decision boundary.We validate the proposed multi-label cluster discrimination method with experiments on different scales of models and pre-training datasets.Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple downstream tasks including linear probe, zero-shot classification, and image-text retrieval.</p>

                  <p>As short-form video-sharing platforms become a significant channel for news consumption, fake news in short videos has emerged as a serious threat in the online information ecosystem, making developing detection methods for this new scenario an urgent need.Compared with that in text and image formats, fake news on short video platforms contains rich but heterogeneous information in various modalities, posing a challenge to effective feature utilization.Unlike existing works mostly focusing on analyzing what is presented, we introduce a novel perspective that considers how it might be created.Through the lens of the creative process behind news video production, our empirical analysis uncovers the unique characteristics of fake news videos in material selection and editing.Based on the obtained insights, we design FakingRecipe, a creative process-aware model for detecting fake news short videos.It captures the fake news preferences in material selection from sentimental and semantic aspects and considers the traits of material editing from spatial and temporal aspects.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To improve evaluation comprehensiveness, we first construct FakeTT, an English dataset for this task, and conduct experiments on both FakeTT and the existing Chinese FakeSV dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.76</span></span>The results show FakingRecipe's superiority in detecting fake news on short video platforms.</p>

                  <p>Facial Recognition Systems (FRSs) are being developed and deployed globally at unprecedented rates.Most platforms are designed in a limited set of countries but deployed in worldwide, without adequate checkpoints.This is especially problematic for Global South countries which lack strong legislation to safeguard persons facing disparate performance of these systems.A combination of unavailability of datasets, lack of understanding of FRS functionality and low-resource bias mitigation measures accentuate the problem.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we propose a new face dataset composed of 6,579 unique male and female sportspersons from eight countries around the world. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.894</span></span>More than 50% of the dataset comprises individuals from the Global South countries and is demographically diverse.To aid adversarial audits and robust model training, each image has four adversarial variants, totaling over 40,000 images.We also benchmark five popular FRSs, both commercial and open-source, for the task of gender prediction (and country prediction for one of the open-source models as an example of red-teaming).Experiments on industrial FRSs reveal accuracies ranging from 98.2%--38.1%, with a large disparity between males and females in the Global South (max difference of 38.5%).Biases are also observed in all FRSs between females of the Global North and South (max difference of ~50%).Grad-CAM analysis identifies the nose, forehead and mouth as the regions of interest on one of the open-source FRSs.Utilizing this insight, we design simple, low-resource bias mitigation solutions using few-shot and novel contrastive learning techniques significantly improving the accuracy with disparity between males and females reducing from 50% to 1.5% in one of the settings.In the red-teaming experiment with the open-source Deepface model, contrastive learning proves more effective than simple fine-tuning.</p>

                  <p>Contrastive Language Image Pre-training (CLIP) has recently demonstrated success across various tasks due to superior feature representation empowered by image-text contrastive learning.However, the instance discrimination method used by CLIP can hardly encode the semantic structure of training data.To handle this limitation, cluster discrimination has been proposed through iterative cluster assignment and classification.Nevertheless, most cluster discrimination approaches only define a single pseudo-label for each image, neglecting multi-label signals in the image.In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-Label Cluster Discrimination method named MLCD to enhance representation learning.In the clustering step, we first cluster the large-scale LAION-400M dataset into one million centers based on off-the-shelf embedding features.Considering that natural images frequently contain multiple visual objects or attributes, we select the multiple closest centers as auxiliary class labels.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In the discrimination step, we design a novel multi-label classification loss, which elegantly separates losses from positive classes and negative classes, and alleviates ambiguity on decision boundary. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.662</span></span>We validate the proposed multi-label cluster discrimination method with experiments on different scales of models and pre-training datasets.Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple downstream tasks including linear probe, zero-shot classification, and image-text retrieval.</p>

                  <p>In object detection, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain.However, UDA's reliance on labeled source data restricts its adaptability in privacy-related scenarios.This study focuses on source-free object detection (SFOD), which adapts a source-trained detector to an unlabeled target domain without using labeled source data.Recent advancements in self-training, particularly with the Mean Teacher (MT) framework, show promise for SFOD deployment.However, the absence of source supervision significantly compromises the stability of these approaches.We identify two primary issues, (1) uncontrollable degradation of the teacher model due to inopportune updates from the student model, and (2) the student model's tendency to replicate errors from incorrect pseudo labels, leading to it being trapped in a local optimum.Both factors contribute to a detrimental circular dependency, resulting in rapid performance degradation in recent self-training frameworks.To tackle these challenges, we propose the Dynamic Retraining-Updating (DRU) mechanism, which actively manages the student training and teacher updating processes to achieve co-evolutionary training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, we introduce Historical Student Loss to mitigate the influence of incorrect pseudo labels. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.661</span></span>Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in the SFOD setting on multiple domain adaptation benchmarks, comparable to or even surpassing advanced UDA methods.The code will be released at https://github.com/lbktrinh/DRU</p>

                  <p>Developing accurate hand gesture perception models is critical for various robotic applications, enabling effective communication between humans and machines and directly impacting neurorobotics and interactive robots.Recently, surface electromyography (sEMG) has been explored for its rich informational context and accessibility when combined with advanced machine learning approaches and wearable systems.The literature presents numerous approaches to boost performance while ensuring robustness for neurorobots using sEMG, often resulting in models requiring high processing power, large datasets, and less scalable solutions.This paper addresses this challenge by proposing the decoding of muscle synchronization rather than individual muscle activation.We study coherence-based functional muscle networks as the core of our perception model, proposing that functional synchronization between muscles and the graph-based network of muscle connectivity encode contextual information about intended hand gestures.This can be decoded using shallow machine learning approaches without the need for deep temporal networks.Our technique could impact myoelectric control of neurorobots by reducing computational burdens and enhancing efficiency.The approach is benchmarked on the Ninapro database, which contains 12 EMG signals from 40 subjects performing 17 hand gestures.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It achieves an accuracy of 85.1%, demonstrating improved performance compared to existing methods while requiring much less computational power. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.699</span></span>The results support the hypothesis that a coherence-based functional muscle network encodes critical information related to gesture execution, significantly enhancing hand gesture perception with potential applications for neurorobotic systems and interactive machines.</p>

                  <p>Context: IoT systems, networks of connected devices powered by software, require studying software quality for maintenance.Despite extensive studies on non-IoT software quality, research on IoT software quality is lacking.It is uncertain if IoT and non-IoT systems software are comparable, hindering the confident application of results and best practices gained on non-IoT systems.   Objective:Therefore, we compare the code quality of two equivalent sets of IoT and non-IoT systems to determine whether there are similarities and differences.We also collect and revisit software-engineering best practices in non-IoT contexts to apply them to IoT.   Method: We design and apply a systematic method to select two sets of 94 non-IoT and IoT systems software from GitHub with comparable characteristics.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We compute quality metrics on the systems in these two sets and then analyse and compare the metric values. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.644</span></span>We analyse in depth and provide specific examples of IoT system's complexity and how it manifests in the codebases.After the comparison, We systematically select and present a list of best practices to address the observed difference between IoT and non-IoT code.   Results: Through a comparison of metrics, we conclude that software for IoT systems is more complex, coupled, larger, less maintainable, and cohesive than non-IoT systems.Several factors, such as integrating multiple hardware and software components and managing data communication between them, contribute to these differences.Considering these differences, we present a revisited best practices list with approaches, tools, or techniques for developing IoT systems.As example, applying modularity, and refactoring are best practices for lowering the complexity.   Conclusion: Based on our work, researchers can now make an informed decision using existing studies on the quality of non-IoT systems for IoT systems.</p>

                  <p>Fredman proposed in 1976 the following algorithmic problem: Given are a ground set $X$, some partial order $P$ over $X$, and some comparison oracle $O_L$ that specifies a linear order $L$ over $X$ that extends $P$. A query to $O_L$ has as input distinct $x, x' \in X$ and outputs whether $x <_L x'$ or vice versa.If we denote by $e(P)$ the number of linear extensions of $P$, then $\log e(P)$ is a worst-case lower bound on the number of queries needed to output the sorted order of $X$.   Fredman did not specify in what form the partial order is given.Haeupler, Hlad\'ik, Iacono, Rozhon, Tarjan, and T\v{e}tek ('24) propose to assume as input a directed acyclic graph, $G$, with $m$ edges and $n=|X|$ vertices.Denote by $P_G$ the partial order induced by $G$. Algorithmic performance is measured in running time and the number of queries used, where they use $\Theta(m + n + \log e(P_G))$ time and $\Theta(\log e(P_G))$ queries to output $X$ in its sorted order.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Their algorithm is worst-case optimal in terms of running time and queries, both. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span>Their algorithm combines topological sorting with heapsort, and uses sophisticated data structures (including a recent type of heap with a working-set bound).Their analysis relies upon sophisticated counting arguments using entropy, recursively defined sets defined over the run of their algorithm, and vertices in the graph that they identify as bottlenecks for sorting.   In this paper, we do away with sophistication.We show that when the input is a directed acyclic graph then the problem admits a simple solution using $\Theta(m + n + \log e(P_G))$ time and $\Theta(\log e(P_G))$ queries.Especially our proofs are much simpler as we avoid the usage of advanced charging arguments and data structures, and instead rely upon two brief observations.</p>

                  <p>The simulation of electromagnetic devices with complex geometries and large-scale discrete systems benefits from advanced computational methods like IsoGeometric Analysis and Domain Decomposition.In this paper, we employ both concepts in an Isogeometric Tearing and Interconnecting method to enable the use of parallel computations for magnetostatic problems.We address the underlying non-uniqueness by using a graph-theoretic approach, the tree-cotree decomposition.The classical tree-cotree gauging is adapted to be feasible for parallelization, which requires that all local subsystems are uniquely solvable.Our contribution consists of an explicit algorithm for constructing compatible trees and combining it with a dual-primal approach to enable parallelization.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The correctness of the proposed approach is proved and verified by numerical experiments, showing its accuracy, scalability and optimal convergence. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.716</span></span></p>

                  <p>Factor analysis, often regarded as a Bayesian variant of matrix factorization, offers superior capabilities in capturing uncertainty, modeling complex dependencies, and ensuring robustness.As the deep learning era arrives, factor analysis is receiving less and less attention due to their limited expressive ability.On the contrary, contrastive learning has emerged as a potent technique with demonstrated efficacy in unsupervised representational learning.While the two methods are different paradigms, recent theoretical analysis has revealed the mathematical equivalence between contrastive learning and matrix factorization, providing a potential possibility for factor analysis combined with contrastive learning.Motivated by the interconnectedness of contrastive learning, matrix factorization, and factor analysis, this paper introduces a novel Contrastive Factor Analysis framework, aiming to leverage factor analysis's advantageous properties within the realm of contrastive learning.To further leverage the interpretability properties of non-negative factor analysis, which can learn disentangled representations, contrastive factor analysis is extended to a non-negative version.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, extensive experimental validation showcases the efficacy of the proposed contrastive (non-negative) factor analysis methodology across multiple key properties, including expressiveness, robustness, interpretability, and accurate uncertainty estimation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span></p>

                  <p>It is helpful in preventing colorectal cancer to detect and treat polyps in the gastrointestinal tract early.However, there have been few studies to date on designing polyp image classification networks that balance efficiency and accuracy.This challenge is mainly attributed to the fact that polyps are similar to other pathologies and have complex features influenced by texture, color, and morphology.In this paper, we propose a novel network DFE-IANet based on both spectral transformation and feature interaction.Firstly, to extract detailed features and multi-scale features, the features are transformed by the multi-scale frequency domain feature extraction (MSFD) block to extract texture details at the fine-grained level in the frequency domain.Secondly, the multi-scale interaction attention (MSIA) block is designed to enhance the network's capability of extracting critical features.This block introduces multi-scale features into self-attention, aiming to adaptively guide the network to concentrate on vital regions.Finally, with a compact parameter of only 4M, DFE-IANet outperforms the latest and classical networks in terms of efficiency.Furthermore, DFE-IANet achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on the challenging Kvasir dataset, demonstrating a remarkable Top-1 accuracy of 93.94%.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This outstanding accuracy surpasses ViT by 8.94%, ResNet50 by 1.69%, and VMamba by 1.88%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.64</span></span>Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/PURSUETHESUN/DFE-IANet.</p>

                  <p>Continual learning (CL) is a fundamental topic in machine learning, where the goal is to train a model with continuously incoming data and tasks.Due to the memory limit, we cannot store all the historical data, and therefore confront the ``catastrophic forgetting'' problem, i.e., the performance on the previous tasks can substantially decrease because of the missing information in the latter period.Though a number of elegant methods have been proposed, the catastrophic forgetting phenomenon still cannot be well avoided in practice.In this paper, we study the problem from the gradient perspective, where our aim is to develop an effective algorithm to calibrate the gradient in each updating step of the model; namely, our goal is to guide the model to be updated in the right direction under the situation that a large amount of historical data are unavailable.Our idea is partly inspired by the seminal stochastic variance reduction methods (e.g., SVRG and SAGA) for reducing the variance of gradient estimation in stochastic gradient descent algorithms.Another benefit is that our approach can be used as a general tool, which is able to be incorporated with several existing popular CL methods to achieve better performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also conduct a set of experiments on several benchmark datasets to evaluate the performance in practice. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.733</span></span></p>

                  <p>A semi-streaming algorithm in dynamic graph streams processes any $n$-vertex graph by making one or multiple passes over a stream of insertions and deletions to edges of the graph and using $O(n \cdot \mbox{polylog}(n))$ space.Semi-streaming algorithms for dynamic streams were first obtained in the seminal work of Ahn, Guha, and McGregor in 2012, alongside the introduction of the graph sketching technique, which remains the de facto way of designing algorithms in this model and a highly popular technique for designing graph algorithms in general.   We settle the pass complexity of approximating maximum matchings in dynamic streams via semi-streaming algorithms by improving the state-of-the-art in both upper and lower bounds.   We present a randomized sketching based semi-streaming algorithm for $O(1)$-approximation of maximum matching in dynamic streams using $O(\log\log{n})$ passes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The approximation ratio of this algorithm can be improved to $(1+\epsilon)$ for any fixed $\epsilon > 0$ even on weighted graphs using standard techniques. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.629</span></span>This exponentially improves upon several $O(\log{n})$ pass algorithms developed for this problem since the introduction of the dynamic graph streaming model.

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of natural language processing, achieving unprecedented performance across a variety of applications by leveraging increased model sizes and sequence lengths.However, the associated rise in computational and memory costs poses significant challenges, particularly in managing long sequences due to the quadratic complexity of the transformer attention mechanism.This paper focuses on the long-context scenario, addressing the inefficiencies in KV cache memory consumption during inference.Unlike existing approaches that optimize the memory based on the sequence lengths, we uncover that the channel dimension of the KV cache exhibits significant redundancy, characterized by unbalanced magnitude distribution and low-rank structure in attention weights.Based on these observations, we propose ThinK, a novel query-dependent KV cache pruning method designed to minimize attention weight loss while selectively pruning the least significant channels.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our approach not only maintains or enhances model accuracy but also achieves a reduction in memory costs by over 20% compared with vanilla KV cache eviction methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.61</span></span>Extensive evaluations on the LLaMA3 and Mistral models across various long-sequence datasets confirm the efficacy of ThinK, setting a new precedent for efficient LLM deployment without compromising performance.We also outline the potential of extending our method to value cache pruning, demonstrating ThinK's versatility and broad applicability in reducing both memory and computational overheads.</p>

                  <p>The development of real-world Large Language Models (LLMs) necessitates checkpointing of training states in persistent storage to mitigate potential software and hardware failures, as well as to facilitate checkpoint transferring within the training pipeline and across various tasks.Due to the immense size of LLMs, saving and loading checkpoints often incur intolerable minute-level stalls, significantly diminishing training efficiency.Besides, when transferring checkpoints across tasks, checkpoint resharding, defined as loading checkpoints into parallel configurations differing from those used for saving, is often required according to the characteristics and resource quota of specific tasks.Previous checkpointing systems[16,3,33,6] assume consistent parallel configurations, failing to address the complexities of checkpoint transformation during resharding.Furthermore, in the industry platform, developers create checkpoints from different training frameworks[23,36,21,11], each with its own unique storage and I/O logic.This diversity complicates the implementation of unified checkpoint management and optimization.To address these challenges, we introduce ByteCheckpoint, a PyTorch-native multi-framework LLM checkpointing system that supports automatic online checkpoint resharding.ByteCheckpoint employs a data/metadata disaggregated storage architecture, decoupling checkpoint storage from the adopted parallelism strategies and training frameworks.We design an efficient asynchronous tensor merging technique to settle the irregular tensor sharding problem and propose several I/O performance optimizations to significantly enhance the efficiency of checkpoint saving and loading.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results demonstrate ByteCheckpoint's substantial advantages in reducing checkpoint saving (by up to 529.22X) and loading (by up to 3.51X) costs, compared to baseline methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.629</span></span></p>

                  <p>Bluesky is a Twitter-like decentralized social media platform that has recently grown in popularity.After an invite-only period, it opened to the public worldwide on February 6th, 2024.In this paper, we provide a longitudinal analysis of user activity in the two months around the opening, studying changes in the general characteristics of the platform due to the rapid growth of the user base.We observe a broad distribution of activity similar to more established platforms, but a higher volume of original than reshared content, and very low toxicity.After opening to the public, Bluesky experienced a large surge in new users and activity, especially posting English and Japanese content.In particular, several accounts entered the discussion with suspicious behavior, like following many accounts and sharing content from low-credibility news outlets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Some of these have already been classified as spam or suspended, suggesting effective moderation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.607</span></span></p>

                  <p>The purpose of this paper is to fill a gap in the general understanding -- and academic scrutiny -- of current and emerging workflows for designing and fabricating integrated circuits.The approach is to compare the IC design workflow with that for printed circuit boards, then to discern a classification for threats.The need to define and secure workflows is amplified by both U.S. investment in the semiconductor manufacturing and market forces affecting GPU production for AI applications.The origin of this knowledge gap can be the proprietary nature of solution spaces, but it can be the lack of demand for teaching and learning for engineers and technicians in this domain.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper presents a framework for understanding the security of design workflows in a vendor- and tool-agnostic way. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span></p>

                  <p>The Rust programming language has garnered significant attention due to its robust safety features and memory management capabilities.Despite its guaranteed memory safety, Rust programs still suffer from runtime errors that are unmanageable, i.e., panic errors.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Notably, over half of the bugs in rustc, Rust's own compiler, are attributable to crash stemming from panic errors. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>However, understanding root causes and resolving these panics often requires substantial effort due to the limited information provided, and the stack backtrace could be intricate, often omitting the actual fault locations.Although numerous automated program repair techniques exist, we observe that the prevailing fix patterns do not readily apply to Rust programs due to natural differences in language mechanisms.To tackle the above challenges, this paper introduces a systematic study aimed at fixing Rust panic bugs.We commence by assembling a dataset, namely Panic4R, which includes 102 real panic bugs and their fixes from the top 500 most downloaded open-source crates.By analyzing Rust's implementation, we identify Rust-specific patterns for fixing panic bugs, which can aid in understanding and providing guidance for generating patches.Finally, we design and implement the first automated fixing tool, PanicKiller, for Rust panic bugs, which effectively generates correct patches on the real-world large-scale dataset, and has already assisted in the resolution of 28 panic bugs in open-source projects.Each resolved issue has been validated by the developers and merged into the respective codebases.</p>

To address this limitation, we propose a self-directed LLM-based automated program repair, ThinkRepair, with two main phases: collection phase and fixing phase.The former phase automatically collects various chains of thoughts that constitute pre-fixed knowledge by instructing LLMs with the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompt.The latter phase targets fixing a bug by first selecting examples for few-shot learning and second automatically interacting with LLMs, optionally appending with feedback of testing information.   Evaluations on two widely studied datasets (Defects4J and QuixBugs) by comparing ThinkRepair with 12 SOTA APRs indicate the priority of ThinkRepair in fixing bugs.Notably, ThinkRepair fixes 98 bugs and improves baselines by 27%-344.4% on Defects4J V1.2.On Defects4J V2.0, ThinkRepair fixes 12-65 more bugs than the SOTA APRs.Additionally, ThinkRepair also makes a considerable improvement on QuixBugs (31 for Java and 21 for Python at most).</p>

                  <p>This paper introduces Patched Round-Trip Correctness (Patched RTC), a novel evaluation technique for Large Language Models (LLMs) applied to diverse software development tasks, particularly focusing on "outer loop" activities such as bug fixing, code review, and documentation updates.Patched RTC extends the original Round-Trip Correctness method to work with any LLM and downstream task, offering a self-evaluating framework that measures consistency and robustness of model responses without human intervention.The study demonstrates a correlation between Patched RTC scores and task-specific accuracy metrics, presenting it as an alternative to the LLM-as-Judge paradigm for open-domain task evaluation.We implement Patched RTC in an open-source framework called patchwork, allowing for transparent evaluation during inference across various patchflows.Experiments comparing GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models across different software development tasks reveal that Patched RTC effectively distinguishes model performance and task difficulty.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The paper also explores the impact of consistency prompts on improving model accuracy, suggesting that Patched RTC can guide prompt refinement and model selection for complex software development workflows. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span></p>
