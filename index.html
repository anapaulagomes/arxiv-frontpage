                  <p>We consider the generative modeling of speech over multiple minutes, a requirement for long-form multimedia generation and audio-native voice assistants.However, current spoken language models struggle to generate plausible speech past tens of seconds, from high temporal resolution of speech tokens causing loss of coherence, to architectural issues with long-sequence training or extrapolation, to memory costs at inference time.With these considerations we propose SpeechSSM, the first speech language model to learn from and sample long-form spoken audio (e.g., 16 minutes of read or extemporaneous speech) in a single decoding session without text intermediates, based on recent advances in linear-time sequence modeling.Furthermore, to address growing challenges in spoken language evaluation, especially in this new long-form setting, we propose: new embedding-based and LLM-judged metrics; quality measurements over length and time; and a new benchmark for long-form speech processing and generation, LibriSpeech-Long.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Speech samples and the dataset are released at https://google.github.io/tacotron/publications/speechssm/ <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.737</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recently, significant advances have been made in Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs) in both academia and industry.However, methods to evaluate and benchmark the performance of different Video LLMs, especially their fine-grained, temporal visual capabilities, remain very limited.On one hand, current benchmarks use relatively simple videos (e.g., subtitled movie clips) where the model can understand the entire video by processing just a few frames.On the other hand, their datasets lack diversity in task format, comprising only QA or multi-choice QA, which overlooks the models' capacity for generating in-depth and precise texts.Sports videos, which feature intricate visual information, sequential events, and emotionally charged commentary, present a critical challenge for Video LLMs, making sports commentary an ideal benchmarking task.Inspired by these challenges, we propose a novel task: sports video commentary generation, developed $\textbf{SCBench}$ for Video LLMs.To construct such a benchmark, we introduce (1) $\textbf{SCORES}$, a six-dimensional metric specifically designed for our task, upon which we propose a GPT-based evaluation method, and (2) $\textbf{CommentarySet}$, a dataset consisting of 5,775 annotated video clips and ground-truth labels tailored to our metric.Based on SCBench, we conduct comprehensive evaluations on multiple Video LLMs (e.g. VILA, Video-LLaVA, etc.) and chain-of-thought baseline methods.Our results found that InternVL-Chat-2 achieves the best performance with 5.44, surpassing the second-best by 1.04.Our work provides a fresh perspective for future research, aiming to enhance models' overall capabilities in complex visual understanding tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our dataset will be released soon. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.978</span></span></p>

                  <p>Referring Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT) is an important topic in the current tracking field.Its task form is to guide the tracker to track objects that match the language description.Current research mainly focuses on referring multi-object tracking under single-view, which refers to a view sequence or multiple unrelated view sequences.However, in the single-view, some appearances of objects are easily invisible, resulting in incorrect matching of objects with the language description.In this work, we propose a new task, called Cross-view Referring Multi-Object Tracking (CRMOT).It introduces the cross-view to obtain the appearances of objects from multiple views, avoiding the problem of the invisible appearances of objects in RMOT task.CRMOT is a more challenging task of accurately tracking the objects that match the language description and maintaining the identity consistency of objects in each cross-view.To advance CRMOT task, we construct a cross-view referring multi-object tracking benchmark based on CAMPUS and DIVOTrack datasets, named CRTrack.Specifically, it provides 13 different scenes and 221 language descriptions.Furthermore, we propose an end-to-end cross-view referring multi-object tracking method, named CRTracker.Extensive experiments on the CRTrack benchmark verify the effectiveness of our method.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/chen-si-jia/CRMOT. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.852</span></span></p>

                  <p>Sound designers and Foley artists usually sonorize a scene, such as from a movie or video game, by manually annotating and sonorizing each action of interest in the video.In our case, the intent is to leave full creative control to sound designers with a tool that allows them to bypass the more repetitive parts of their work, thus being able to focus on the creative aspects of sound production.We achieve this presenting Stable-V2A, a two-stage model consisting of: an RMS-Mapper that estimates an envelope representative of the audio characteristics associated with the input video; and Stable-Foley, a diffusion model based on Stable Audio Open that generates audio semantically and temporally aligned with the target video.Temporal alignment is guaranteed by the use of the envelope as a ControlNet input, while semantic alignment is achieved through the use of sound representations chosen by the designer as cross-attention conditioning of the diffusion process.We train and test our model on Greatest Hits, a dataset commonly used to evaluate V2A models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, to test our model on a case study of interest, we introduce Walking The Maps, a dataset of videos extracted from video games depicting animated characters walking in different locations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.714</span></span>Samples and code available on our demo page at https://ispamm.github.io/Stable-V2A.</p>

To address this gap, GIRAFE is a data repository designed to facilitate the development of advanced techniques for the semantic segmentation, analysis, and fast evaluation of High-Speed videoendoscopic sequences of the vocal folds.The repository includes 65 high-speed videoendoscopic recordings from a cohort of 50 patients (30 female, 20 male).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset comprises 15 recordings from healthy controls, 26 from patients with diagnosed voice disorders, and 24 with an unknown health condition. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.91</span></span>All of them were manually annotated by an expert, including the masks corresponding to the semantic segmentation of the glottal gap.The repository is also complemented with the automatic segmentation of the glottal area using different state-of-the-art approaches.

                  <p>Text-driven human motion synthesis is capturing significant attention for its ability to effortlessly generate intricate movements from abstract text cues, showcasing its potential for revolutionizing motion design not only in film narratives but also in virtual reality experiences and computer game development.Existing methods often rely on 3D motion capture data, which require special setups resulting in higher costs for data acquisition, ultimately limiting the diversity and scope of human motion.In contrast, 2D human videos offer a vast and accessible source of motion data, covering a wider range of styles and activities.In this paper, we explore leveraging 2D human motion extracted from videos as an alternative data source to improve text-driven 3D motion generation.Our approach introduces a novel framework that disentangles local joint motion from global movements, enabling efficient learning of local motion priors from 2D data.We first train a single-view 2D local motion generator on a large dataset of text-motion pairs.To enhance this model to synthesize 3D motion, we fine-tune the generator with 3D data, transforming it into a multi-view generator that predicts view-consistent local joint motion and root dynamics.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments on the HumanML3D dataset and novel text prompts demonstrate that our method efficiently utilizes 2D data, supporting realistic 3D human motion generation and broadening the range of motion types it supports. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.709</span></span>Our code will be made publicly available at https://zju3dv.github.io/Motion-2-to-3/.</p>

                  <p>Domain Generalization (DG) seeks to transfer knowledge from multiple source domains to unseen target domains, even in the presence of domain shifts.Achieving effective generalization typically requires a large and diverse set of labeled source data to learn robust representations that can generalize to new, unseen domains.However, obtaining such high-quality labeled data is often costly and labor-intensive, limiting the practical applicability of DG.To address this, we investigate a more practical and challenging problem: semi-supervised domain generalization (SSDG) under a label-efficient paradigm.In this paper, we propose a novel method, CAT, which leverages semi-supervised learning with limited labeled data to achieve competitive generalization performance under domain shifts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our method addresses key limitations of previous approaches, such as reliance on fixed thresholds and sensitivity to noisy pseudo-labels. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>CAT combines adaptive thresholding with noisy label refinement techniques, creating a straightforward yet highly effective solution for SSDG tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, our approach uses flexible thresholding to generate high-quality pseudo-labels with higher class diversity while refining noisy pseudo-labels to improve their reliability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.679</span></span>Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method, highlighting its effectiveness in achieving robust generalization under domain shift.</p>

                  <p>Model inversion attacks pose a significant privacy threat to machine learning models by reconstructing sensitive data from their outputs.While various defenses have been proposed to counteract these attacks, they often come at the cost of the classifier's utility, thus creating a challenging trade-off between privacy protection and model utility.Moreover, most existing defenses require retraining the classifier for enhanced robustness, which is impractical for large-scale, well-established models.This paper introduces a novel defense mechanism to better balance privacy and utility, particularly against adversaries who employ a machine learning model (i.e., inversion model) to reconstruct private data.Drawing inspiration from data poisoning attacks, which can compromise the performance of machine learning models, we propose a strategy that leverages data poisoning to contaminate the training data of inversion models, thereby preventing model inversion attacks.   Two defense methods are presented.The first, termed label-preserving poisoning attacks for all output vectors (LPA), involves subtle perturbations to all output vectors while preserving their labels.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings demonstrate that these minor perturbations, introduced through a data poisoning approach, significantly increase the difficulty of data reconstruction without compromising the utility of the classifier. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>Subsequently, we introduce a second method, label-flipping poisoning for partial output vectors (LFP), which selectively perturbs a small subset of output vectors and alters their labels during the process.Empirical results indicate that LPA is notably effective, outperforming the current state-of-the-art defenses.Our data poisoning-based defense provides a new retraining-free defense paradigm that preserves the victim classifier's utility.</p>

                  <p>Benefiting from the advancements in LLMs, NLP software has undergone rapid development.Such software is widely employed in various safety-critical tasks, such as financial sentiment analysis, toxic content moderation, and log generation.To our knowledge, there are no known automated robustness testing methods specifically designed for LLM-based NLP software.Given the complexity of LLMs and the unpredictability of real-world inputs (including prompts and examples), it is essential to examine the robustness of overall inputs to ensure the safety of such software.   To this end, this paper introduces the first AutOmated Robustness Testing frAmework, AORTA, which reconceptualizes the testing process into a combinatorial optimization problem.Existing testing methods designed for DNN-based software can be applied to LLM-based software by AORTA, but their effectiveness is limited.To address this, we propose a novel testing method for LLM-based software within AORTA called Adaptive Beam Search.ABS is tailored for the expansive feature space of LLMs and improves testing effectiveness through an adaptive beam width and the capability for backtracking.   We successfully embed 18 test methods in the designed framework AORTA and compared the test validity of ABS with three datasets and five threat models.ABS facilitates a more comprehensive and accurate robustness assessment before software deployment, with an average test success rate of 86.138%.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Compared to the currently best-performing baseline PWWS, ABS significantly reduces the computational overhead by up to 3441.895 seconds per successful test case and decreases the number of queries by 218.762 times on average. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span>Furthermore, test cases generated by ABS exhibit greater naturalness and transferability.</p>

Our algorithms certify a bound which is asymptotically smaller than the naive one, given by the maximum singular value of $M$, for nearly the widest-possible range of $n,d,$ and $\eta$. Efficiently certifying such a bound for a range of $n,d$ and $\eta$ which is larger by any polynomial factor than what is achieved by our algorithm would violate lower bounds in the SQ and low-degree polynomials models.Our certification algorithm makes essential use of the Sum-of-Squares hierarchy.To prove the correctness of our algorithm, we develop a new combinatorial connection between the graph matrix approach to analyze random matrices with dependent entries, and the Efron-Stein decomposition of functions of independent random variables.   As applications of our certification algorithm, we obtain new efficient algorithms for a wide range of well-studied algorithmic tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In algorithmic robust statistics, we obtain new algorithms for robust mean and covariance estimation with tradeoffs between breakdown point and sample complexity, which are nearly matched by SQ and low-degree polynomial lower bounds (that we establish). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.609</span></span>We also obtain new polynomial-time guarantees for certification of $\ell_1/\ell_2$ distortion of random subspaces of $\mathbb{R}^n$ (also with nearly matching lower bounds), sparse principal component analysis, and certification of the $2\rightarrow p$ norm of a random matrix.</p>

                  <p>Association rules are an important technique for gaining insights over large relational datasets consisting of tuples of elements (i.e. attribute-value pairs).However, it is difficult to explain the relative importance of data elements with respect to the rules in which they appear.This paper develops a measure of an element's contribution to a set of association rules based on Shapley values, denoted SHARQ (ShApley Rules Quantification).As is the case with many Shapely-based computations, the cost of a naive calculation of the score is exponential in the number of elements.To that end, we present an efficient framework for computing the exact SharQ value of a single element whose running time is practically linear in the number of rules.Going one step further, we develop an efficient multi-element SHARQ algorithm which amortizes the cost of the single element SHARQ calculation over a set of elements.Based on the definition of SHARQ for elements we describe two additional use cases for association rules explainability: rule importance and attribute importance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments over a novel benchmark dataset containing 45 instances of mined rule sets show the effectiveness of our approach. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span></p>

                  <p>Traditional analyses of gradient descent optimization show that, when the largest eigenvalue of the loss Hessian - often referred to as the sharpness - is below a critical learning-rate threshold, then training is 'stable' and training loss decreases monotonically.Recent studies, however, have suggested that the majority of modern deep neural networks achieve good performance despite operating outside this stable regime.In this work, we demonstrate that such instabilities, induced by large learning rates, move model parameters toward flatter regions of the loss landscape.Our crucial insight lies in noting that, during these instabilities, the orientation of the Hessian eigenvectors rotate.This, we conjecture, allows the model to explore regions of the loss landscape that display more desirable geometrical properties for generalization, such as flatness.These rotations are a consequence of network depth, and we prove that for any network with depth > 1, unstable growth in parameters cause rotations in the principal components of the Hessian, which promote exploration of the parameter space away from unstable directions.Our empirical studies reveal an implicit regularization effect in gradient descent with large learning rates operating beyond the stability threshold.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We find these lead to excellent generalization performance on modern benchmark datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.669</span></span></p>

                  <p>The availability of challenging simulation environments is pivotal for advancing the field of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL).In cooperative MARL settings, the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) has gained prominence as a benchmark for algorithms following centralized training with decentralized execution paradigm.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, with continual advancements in SMAC, many algorithms now exhibit near-optimal performance, complicating the evaluation of their true effectiveness. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.658</span></span>To alleviate this problem, in this work, we highlight a critical issue: the default opponent policy in these environments lacks sufficient diversity, leading MARL algorithms to overfit and exploit unintended vulnerabilities rather than learning robust strategies.To overcome these limitations, we propose SMAC-HARD, a novel benchmark designed to enhance training robustness and evaluation comprehensiveness.SMAC-HARD supports customizable opponent strategies, randomization of adversarial policies, and interfaces for MARL self-play, enabling agents to generalize to varying opponent behaviors and improve model stability.Furthermore, we introduce a black-box testing framework wherein agents are trained without exposure to the edited opponent scripts but are tested against these scripts to evaluate the policy coverage and adaptability of MARL algorithms.We conduct extensive evaluations of widely used and state-of-the-art algorithms on SMAC-HARD, revealing the substantial challenges posed by edited and mixed strategy opponents.Additionally, the black-box strategy tests illustrate the difficulty of transferring learned policies to unseen adversaries.We envision SMAC-HARD as a critical step toward benchmarking the next generation of MARL algorithms, fostering progress in self-play methods for multi-agent systems.Our code is available at https://github.com/devindeng94/smac-hard.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities across a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks.However, keeping these models up-to-date with evolving world knowledge remains a significant challenge due to the high costs of frequent retraining.To address this challenge, knowledge editing techniques have emerged to update LLMs with new information without rebuilding the model from scratch.Among these, the in-context editing paradigm stands out for its effectiveness in integrating new knowledge while preserving the model's original capabilities.Despite its potential, existing in-context knowledge editing methods are often task-specific, focusing primarily on multi-hop QA tasks using structured knowledge triples.Moreover, their reliance on few-shot prompting for task decomposition makes them unstable and less effective in generalizing across diverse tasks.   In response to these limitations, we propose EditCoT, a novel knowledge editing framework that flexibly and efficiently updates LLMs across various tasks without retraining.EditCoT works by generating a chain-of-thought (CoT) for a given input and then iteratively refining this CoT process using a CoT editor based on updated knowledge.We evaluate EditCoT across a diverse range of benchmarks, covering multiple languages and tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance while offering superior generalization, effectiveness, and stability compared to existing methods, marking a significant advancement in the field of knowledge updating. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.636</span></span>Code and data are available at: https://github.com/bebr2/EditCoT.</p>

                  <p>Learning a robust video Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is essential for reducing video redundancy and facilitating efficient video generation.Directly applying image VAEs to individual frames in isolation can result in temporal inconsistencies and suboptimal compression rates due to a lack of temporal compression.Existing Video VAEs have begun to address temporal compression; however, they often suffer from inadequate reconstruction performance.In this paper, we present a novel and powerful video autoencoder capable of high-fidelity video encoding.First, we observe that entangling spatial and temporal compression by merely extending the image VAE to a 3D VAE can introduce motion blur and detail distortion artifacts.Thus, we propose temporal-aware spatial compression to better encode and decode the spatial information.Additionally, we integrate a lightweight motion compression model for further temporal compression.Second, we propose to leverage the textual information inherent in text-to-video datasets and incorporate text guidance into our model.This significantly enhances reconstruction quality, particularly in terms of detail preservation and temporal stability.Third, we further improve the versatility of our model through joint training on both images and videos, which not only enhances reconstruction quality but also enables the model to perform both image and video autoencoding.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive evaluations against strong recent baselines demonstrate the superior performance of our method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.825</span></span>The project website can be found at~\href{https://yzxing87.github.io/vae/}{https://yzxing87.github.io/vae/}.</p>

                  <p>In the realm of Text-Based Person Search (TBPS), mainstream methods aim to explore more efficient interaction frameworks between text descriptions and visual data.However, recent approaches encounter two principal challenges.Firstly, the widely used random-based Masked Language Modeling (MLM) considers all the words in the text equally during training.However, massive semantically vacuous words ('with', 'the', etc.) be masked fail to contribute efficient interaction in the cross-modal MLM and hampers the representation alignment.Secondly, manual descriptions in TBPS datasets are tedious and inevitably contain several inaccuracies.To address these issues, we introduce an Attention-Guided Alignment (AGA) framework featuring two innovative components: Attention-Guided Mask (AGM)Modeling and Text Enrichment Module (TEM).AGM dynamically masks semantically meaningful words by aggregating the attention weight derived from the text encoding process, thereby cross-modal MLM can capture information related to the masked word from text context and images and align their representations.Meanwhile, TEM alleviates low-quality representations caused by repetitive and erroneous text descriptions by replacing those semantically meaningful words with MLM's prediction.It not only enriches text descriptions but also prevents overfitting.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments across three challenging benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our AGA, achieving new state-of-the-art results with Rank-1 accuracy reaching 78.36%, 67.31%, and 67.4% on CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, and RSTPReid, respectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.679</span></span></p>

                  <p>Multimodal recommendation systems can learn users' preferences from existing user-item interactions as well as the semantics of multimodal data associated with items.Many existing methods model this through a multimodal user-item graph, approaching multimodal recommendation as a graph learning task.Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promising performance in this domain.Prior research has capitalized on GNNs' capability to capture neighborhood information within certain receptive fields (typically denoted by the number of hops, $K$) to enrich user and item semantics.We observe that the optimal receptive fields for GNNs can vary across different modalities.In this paper, we propose GNNs with Modality-Independent Receptive Fields, which employ separate GNNs with independent receptive fields for different modalities to enhance performance.Our results indicate that the optimal $K$ for certain modalities on specific datasets can be as low as 1 or 2, which may restrict the GNNs' capacity to capture global information.To address this, we introduce a Sampling-based Global Transformer, which utilizes uniform global sampling to effectively integrate global information for GNNs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct comprehensive experiments that demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span>Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/CrawlScript/MIG-GT.</p>

                  <p>Real-time free-view human rendering from sparse-view RGB inputs is a challenging task due to the sensor scarcity and the tight time budget.To ensure efficiency, recent methods leverage 2D CNNs operating in texture space to learn rendering primitives.However, they either jointly learn geometry and appearance, or completely ignore sparse image information for geometry estimation, significantly harming visual quality and robustness to unseen body poses.To address these issues, we present Double Unprojected Textures, which at the core disentangles coarse geometric deformation estimation from appearance synthesis, enabling robust and photorealistic 4K rendering in real-time.Specifically, we first introduce a novel image-conditioned template deformation network, which estimates the coarse deformation of the human template from a first unprojected texture.This updated geometry is then used to apply a second and more accurate texture unprojection.The resulting texture map has fewer artifacts and better alignment with input views, which benefits our learning of finer-level geometry and appearance represented by Gaussian splats.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method in quantitative and qualitative experiments, which significantly surpasses other state-of-the-art methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.676</span></span></p>

This study examines the impact of LLM-based automated code review tools in an industrial setting.The study was conducted within a software development environment that adopted an AI-assisted review tool (based on open-source Qodo PR Agent).Around 238 practitioners across ten projects had access to the tool.We focused on three projects with 4,335 pull requests, 1,568 of which underwent automated reviews.Data collection comprised three sources: (1) a quantitative analysis of pull request data, including comment labels indicating whether developers acted on the automated comments, (2) surveys sent to developers regarding their experience with reviews on individual pull requests, and (3) a broader survey of 22 practitioners capturing their general opinions on automated reviews.   73.8% of automated comments were resolved.However, the average pull request closure duration increased from five hours 52 minutes to eight hours 20 minutes, with varying trends across projects.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Most practitioners reported a minor improvement in code quality due to automated reviews.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.6</span></span>The LLM-based tool proved useful in software development, enhancing bug detection, increasing awareness of code quality, and promoting best practices.However, it also led to longer pull request closure times and introduced drawbacks like faulty reviews, unnecessary corrections, and irrelevant comments.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have shown the potential to assist developers with coding and debugging tasks.However, their role in collaborative issue resolution is underexplored.In this study, we analyzed 1,152 Developer-ChatGPT conversations across 1,012 issues in GitHub to examine the diverse usage of ChatGPT and reliance on its generated code.Our contributions are fourfold.First, we manually analyzed 289 conversations to understand ChatGPT's usage in the GitHub Issues.Our analysis revealed that ChatGPT is primarily utilized for ideation, whereas its usage for validation (e.g., code documentation accuracy) is minimal.Second, we applied BERTopic modeling to identify key areas of engagement on the entire dataset.We found that backend issues (e.g., API management) dominate conversations, while testing is surprisingly less covered.Third, we utilized the CPD clone detection tool to check if the code generated by ChatGPT was used to address issues.Our findings revealed that ChatGPT-generated code was used as-is to resolve only 5.83\% of the issues.Fourth, we estimated sentiment using a RoBERTa-based sentiment analysis model to determine developers' satisfaction with different usages and engagement areas.We found positive sentiment (i.e., high satisfaction) about using ChatGPT for refactoring and addressing data analytics (e.g., categorizing table data) issues.On the contrary, we observed negative sentiment when using ChatGPT to debug issues and address automation tasks (e.g., GUI interactions).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings show the unmet needs and growing dissatisfaction among developers. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.634</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Researchers and ChatGPT developers should focus on developing task-specific solutions that help resolve diverse issues, improving user satisfaction and problem-solving efficiency in software development. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span></p>
