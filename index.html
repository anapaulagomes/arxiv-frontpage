                  <p>Rice is one of the most widely cultivated crops globally and has been developed into numerous varieties.The quality of rice during cultivation is primarily determined by its cultivar and characteristics.Traditionally, rice classification and quality assessment rely on manual visual inspection, a process that is both time-consuming and prone to errors.However, with advancements in machine vision technology, automating rice classification and quality evaluation based on its cultivar and characteristics has become increasingly feasible, enhancing both accuracy and efficiency.This study proposes a real-time evaluation mechanism for comprehensive rice grain assessment, integrating a one-stage object detection approach, a deep convolutional neural network, and traditional machine learning techniques.The proposed framework enables rice variety identification, grain completeness grading, and grain chalkiness evaluation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The rice grain dataset used in this study comprises approximately 20,000 images from six widely cultivated rice varieties in China. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.885</span></span>Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed mechanism achieves a mean average precision (mAP) of 99.14% in the object detection task and an accuracy of 97.89% in the classification task.Furthermore, the framework attains an average accuracy of 97.56% in grain completeness grading within the same rice variety, contributing to an effective quality evaluation system.</p>

                  <p>Alignment techniques have become central to ensuring that Large Language Models (LLMs) generate outputs consistent with human values.However, existing alignment paradigms often model an averaged or monolithic preference, failing to account for the diversity of perspectives across cultures, demographics, and communities.This limitation is particularly critical in health-related scenarios, where plurality is essential due to the influence of culture, religion, personal values, and conflicting opinions.Despite progress in pluralistic alignment, no prior work has focused on health, likely due to the unavailability of publicly available datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this gap, we introduce VITAL, a new benchmark dataset comprising 13.1K value-laden situations and 5.4K multiple-choice questions focused on health, designed to assess and benchmark pluralistic alignment methodologies. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.731</span></span>Through extensive evaluation of eight LLMs of varying sizes, we demonstrate that existing pluralistic alignment techniques fall short in effectively accommodating diverse healthcare beliefs, underscoring the need for tailored AI alignment in specific domains.This work highlights the limitations of current approaches and lays the groundwork for developing health-specific alignment solutions.</p>

                  <p>This paper presents DataSciBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities in data science.Recent related benchmarks have primarily focused on single tasks, easily obtainable ground truth, and straightforward evaluation metrics, which limits the scope of tasks that can be evaluated.In contrast, DataSciBench is constructed based on a more comprehensive and curated collection of natural and challenging prompts for uncertain ground truth and evaluation metrics.We develop a semi-automated pipeline for generating ground truth (GT) and validating evaluation metrics.This pipeline utilizes and implements an LLM-based self-consistency and human verification strategy to produce accurate GT by leveraging collected prompts, predefined task types, and aggregate functions (metrics).Furthermore, we propose an innovative Task - Function - Code (TFC) framework to assess each code execution outcome based on precisely defined metrics and programmatic rules.Our experimental framework involves testing 6 API-based models, 8 open-source general models, and 9 open-source code generation models using the diverse set of prompts we have gathered.This approach aims to provide a more comprehensive and rigorous evaluation of LLMs in data science, revealing their strengths and weaknesses.Experimental results demonstrate that API-based models outperform open-sourced models on all metrics and Deepseek-Coder-33B-Instruct achieves the highest score among open-sourced models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We release all code and data at https://github.com/THUDM/DataSciBench. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.808</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent studies have shown that Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) tend to neglect image content and over-rely on language-model priors, resulting in errors in visually grounded tasks and hallucinations.We hypothesize that this issue arises because existing VLMs are not explicitly trained to generate texts that are accurately grounded in fine-grained image details.To enhance visual feedback during VLM training, we propose S-VCO (Symmetrical Visual Contrastive Optimization), a novel finetuning objective that steers the model toward capturing important visual details and aligning them with corresponding text tokens.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To further facilitate this detailed alignment, we introduce MVC, a paired image-text dataset built by automatically filtering and augmenting visual counterfactual data to challenge the model with hard contrastive cases involving Minimal Visual Contrasts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.744</span></span>Experiments show that our method consistently improves VLM performance across diverse benchmarks covering various abilities and domains, achieving up to a 22% reduction in hallucinations, and significant gains in vision-centric and general tasks.Notably, these improvements become increasingly pronounced in benchmarks with higher visual dependency.In short, S-VCO offers a significant enhancement of VLM's visually-dependent task performance while retaining or even improving the model's general abilities.We opensource our code at https://s-vco.github.io/</p>

In this paper, we conduct an empirical study on LLM-assisted popular micro-video generation (LLMPopcorn).Specifically, we investigate the following research questions: (i) How can LLMs be effectively utilized to assist popular micro-video generation?(ii) To what extent can prompt-based enhancements optimize the LLM-generated content for higher popularity?(iii) How well do various LLMs and video generators perform in the popular micro-video generation task?By exploring these questions, we show that advanced LLMs like DeepSeek-V3 enable micro-video generation to achieve popularity comparable to human-created content.Prompt enhancements further boost popularity, and benchmarking highlights DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeek-R1 among LLMs, while LTX-Video and HunyuanVideo lead in video generation.This pioneering work advances AI-assisted micro-video creation, uncovering new research opportunities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We will release the code and datasets to support future studies. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.817</span></span></p>

                  <p>The continuous operation of Earth-orbiting satellites generates vast and ever-growing archives of Remote Sensing (RS) images.Natural language presents an intuitive interface for accessing, querying, and interpreting the data from such archives.However, existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are predominantly trained on web-scraped, noisy image-text data, exhibiting limited exposure to the specialized domain of RS.This deficiency results in poor performance on RS-specific tasks, as commonly used datasets often lack detailed, scientifically accurate textual descriptions and instead emphasize solely on attributes like date and location.To bridge this critical gap, we introduce GAIA, a novel dataset designed for multi-scale, multi-sensor, and multi-modal RS image analysis.GAIA comprises of 205,150 meticulously curated RS image-text pairs, representing a diverse range of RS modalities associated to different spatial resolutions.Unlike existing vision-language datasets in RS, GAIA specifically focuses on capturing a diverse range of RS applications, providing unique information about environmental changes, natural disasters, and various other dynamic phenomena.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset provides a spatially and temporally balanced distribution, spanning across the globe, covering the last 25 years with a balanced temporal distribution of observations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.879</span></span>GAIA's construction involved a two-stage process: (1) targeted web-scraping of images and accompanying text from reputable RS-related sources, and (2) generation of five high-quality, scientifically grounded synthetic captions for each image using carefully crafted prompts that leverage the advanced vision-language capabilities of GPT-4o.Our extensive experiments, including fine-tuning of CLIP and BLIP2 models, demonstrate that GAIA significantly improves performance on RS image classification, cross-modal retrieval and image captioning tasks.</p>

                  <p>Video Moment Retrieval is a common task to evaluate the performance of visual-language models - it involves localising start and end times of moments in videos from query sentences.The current task formulation assumes that the queried moment is present in the video, resulting in false positive moment predictions when irrelevant query sentences are provided.   In this paper we propose the task of Negative-Aware Video Moment Retrieval (NA-VMR), which considers both moment retrieval accuracy and negative query rejection accuracy.We make the distinction between In-Domain and Out-of-Domain negative queries and provide new evaluation benchmarks for two popular video moment retrieval datasets: QVHighlights and Charades-STA.We analyse the ability of current SOTA video moment retrieval approaches to adapt to Negative-Aware Video Moment Retrieval and propose UniVTG-NA, an adaptation of UniVTG designed to tackle NA-VMR.UniVTG-NA achieves high negative rejection accuracy (avg.$98.4\%$) scores while retaining moment retrieval scores to within $3.87\%$ Recall@1.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Dataset splits and code are available at https://github.com/keflanagan/MomentofUntruth <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.774</span></span></p>

                  <p>We present MatSwap, a method to transfer materials to designated surfaces in an image photorealistically.Such a task is non-trivial due to the large entanglement of material appearance, geometry, and lighting in a photograph.In the literature, material editing methods typically rely on either cumbersome text engineering or extensive manual annotations requiring artist knowledge and 3D scene properties that are impractical to obtain.In contrast, we propose to directly learn the relationship between the input material -- as observed on a flat surface -- and its appearance within the scene, without the need for explicit UV mapping.To achieve this, we rely on a custom light- and geometry-aware diffusion model.We fine-tune a large-scale pre-trained text-to-image model for material transfer using our synthetic dataset, preserving its strong priors to ensure effective generalization to real images.As a result, our method seamlessly integrates a desired material into the target location in the photograph while retaining the identity of the scene.We evaluate our method on synthetic and real images and show that it compares favorably to recent work both qualitatively and quantitatively.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We will release our code and data upon publication. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.773</span></span></p>

                  <p>Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is a key technique for improving conditional generation in diffusion models, enabling more accurate control while enhancing sample quality.It is natural to extend this technique to video diffusion, which generates video conditioned on a variable number of context frames, collectively referred to as history.However, we find two key challenges to guiding with variable-length history: architectures that only support fixed-size conditioning, and the empirical observation that CFG-style history dropout performs poorly.To address this, we propose the Diffusion Forcing Transformer (DFoT), a video diffusion architecture and theoretically grounded training objective that jointly enable conditioning on a flexible number of history frames.We then introduce History Guidance, a family of guidance methods uniquely enabled by DFoT.We show that its simplest form, vanilla history guidance, already significantly improves video generation quality and temporal consistency.A more advanced method, history guidance across time and frequency further enhances motion dynamics, enables compositional generalization to out-of-distribution history, and can stably roll out extremely long videos.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Website: https://boyuan.space/history-guidance <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.755</span></span></p>

                  <p>Medical image segmentation is a crucial task in medical image analysis, but it can be very challenging especially when there are less labeled data but with large unlabeled data.Contrastive learning has proven to be effective for medical image segmentation in semi-supervised learning by constructing contrastive samples from partial pixels.However, although previous contrastive learning methods can mine semantic information from partial pixels within images, they ignore the whole context information of unlabeled images, which is very important to precise segmentation.In order to solve this problem, we propose a novel prototype contrastive learning method called Prototype Contrastive Consistency Segmentation (PCCS) for semi-supervised medical image segmentation.The core idea is to enforce the prototypes of the same semantic class to be closer and push the prototypes in different semantic classes far away from each other.Specifically, we construct a signed distance map and an uncertainty map from unlabeled images.The signed distance map is used to construct prototypes for contrastive learning, and then we estimate the prototype uncertainty from the uncertainty map as trade-off among prototypes.In order to obtain better prototypes, based on the student-teacher architecture, a new mechanism named prototype updating prototype is designed to assist in updating the prototypes for contrastive learning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, we propose an uncertainty-consistency loss to mine more reliable information from unlabeled data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.617</span></span>Extensive experiments on medical image segmentation demonstrate that PCCS achieves better segmentation performance than the state-of-the-art methods.The code is available at https://github.com/comphsh/PCCS.</p>

                  <p>Indices for approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) are a basic component for information retrieval and widely used in database, search, recommendation and RAG systems.In these scenarios, documents or other objects are inserted into and deleted from the working set at a high rate, requiring a stream of updates to the vector index.Algorithms based on proximity graph indices are the most efficient indices for ANNS, winning many benchmark competitions.However, it is challenging to update such graph index at a high rate, while supporting stable recall after many updates.Since the graph is singly-linked, deletions are hard because there is no fast way to find in-neighbors of a deleted vertex.Therefore, to update the graph, state-of-the-art algorithms such as FreshDiskANN accumulate deletions in a batch and periodically consolidate, removing edges to deleted vertices and modifying the graph to ensure recall stability.In this paper, we present IP-DiskANN (InPlaceUpdate-DiskANN), the first algorithm to avoid batch consolidation by efficiently processing each insertion and deletion in-place.Our experiments using standard benchmarks show that IP-DiskANN has stable recall over various lengthy update patterns in both high-recall and low-recall regimes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Further, its query throughput and update speed are better than using the batch consolidation algorithm and HNSW. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span></p>

This paper benchmarks and reports on the results of a large-scale automatic relevance judgment evaluation, the LLMJudge challenge at SIGIR 2024, where different relevance assessment approaches were proposed.In detail, we release and benchmark 42 LLM-generated labels of the TREC 2023 Deep Learning track relevance judgments produced by eight international teams who participated in the challenge.Given their diverse nature, these automatically generated relevance judgments can help the community not only investigate systematic biases caused by LLMs but also explore the effectiveness of ensemble models, analyze the trade-offs between different models and human assessors, and advance methodologies for improving automated evaluation techniques.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The released resource is available at the following link: https://llm4eval.github.io/LLMJudge-benchmark/ <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.655</span></span></p>

                  <p>The continuous surge in data volume and velocity is often dealt with using data orchestration and distributed processing approaches, abstracting away the machine learning challenges that exist at the algorithmic level.With growing interest in automating the learning loop, training with data that arrive in a sequence rather than in the classical in-memory training data form will face a machine learning challenge because of evolving feature distributions across batches of training data biasing the cross-validation step (\cite{sugiyama2012machine}).This work takes a distributed density estimation angle to the problem where data are temporally distributed.It processes data in batches and allows a neural network to treat a batch as training data.The method accumulates knowledge about the data density via posterior probability absorption using the Fisher Information Matrix, which contains information about the local optimization gradients for the batch.This is then used as a regularizer for the loss in the following batch, and therefore the density estimate for the entire dataset constructively gets more robust to the non-iid distribution shift.This needs the presence of a pair of batches in memory at a time, so the space cost is not a function of the size of the complete, distributed dataset.We proposed a novel regularization-based approach Covariate Shift Correction $C^{2}A$ that leverages Fisher information and Kullback-Leibler divergence to adapt to both natural and sequential covariate shift caused by dataset fragmentation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>$C^{2}A$ achieves $19\%$ accuracy at maximum against state-of-the-art methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.674</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent years have seen significant progress in the study of dynamic graph algorithms, and most notably, the introduction of strong lower bound techniques for them (e.g., Henzinger, Krinninger, Nanongkai and Saranurak, STOC 2015; Larsen and Yu, FOCS 2023).As worst-case analysis (adversarial inputs) may lead to the necessity of high running times, a natural question arises: in which cases are high running times really necessary, and in which cases these inputs merely manifest unique pathological cases?   Early attempts to tackle this question were made by Nikoletseas, Reif, Spirakis and Yung (ICALP 1995) and by Alberts and Henzinger (Algorithmica 1998), who considered models with very little adversarial control over the inputs, and showed fast algorithms exist for them.The question was then overlooked for decades, until Henzinger, Lincoln and Saha (SODA 2022) recently addressed uniformly random inputs, and presented algorithms and impossibility results for several subgraph counting problems.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To tackle the above question more thoroughly, we employ smoothed analysis, a celebrated framework introduced by Spielman and Teng (J. ACM, 2004). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.645</span></span>An input is proposed by an adversary but then a noisy version of it is processed by the algorithm instead.Parameterized by the amount of adversarial control, this input model fully interpolates between worst-case inputs and a uniformly random input.Doing so, we extend impossibility results for some problems to the smoothed model with only a minor quantitative loss.That is, we show that partially-adversarial inputs suffice to impose high running times for certain problems.In contrast, we show that other problems become easy even with the slightest amount of noise.In addition, we study the interplay between the adversary and the noise, leading to three natural models of smoothed inputs, for which we show a hierarchy of increasing complexity.</p>

                  <p>Classification models play a critical role in data-driven decision-making applications such as medical diagnosis, user profiling, recommendation systems, and default detection.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Traditional performance metrics, such as accuracy, focus on overall error rates but fail to account for the confidence of incorrect predictions, thereby overlooking the risk of confident misjudgments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.625</span></span>This risk is particularly significant in cost-sensitive and safety-critical domains like medical diagnosis and autonomous driving, where overconfident false predictions may cause severe consequences.To address this issue, we introduce the Fragility Index (FI), a novel metric that evaluates classification performance from a risk-averse perspective by explicitly capturing the tail risk of confident misjudgments.To enhance generalizability, we define FI within the robust satisficing (RS) framework, incorporating data uncertainty.We further develop a model training approach that optimizes FI while maintaining tractability for common loss functions.Specifically, we derive exact reformulations for cross-entropy loss, hinge-type loss, and Lipschitz loss, and extend the approach to deep learning models.Through synthetic experiments and real-world medical diagnosis tasks, we demonstrate that FI effectively identifies misjudgment risk and FI-based training improves model robustness and generalizability.Finally, we extend our framework to deep neural network training, further validating its effectiveness in enhancing deep learning models.</p>

                  <p>While recent low-cost radar-camera approaches have shown promising results in multi-modal 3D object detection, both sensors face challenges from environmental and intrinsic disturbances.Poor lighting or adverse weather conditions degrade camera performance, while radar suffers from noise and positional ambiguity.Achieving robust radar-camera 3D object detection requires consistent performance across varying conditions, a topic that has not yet been fully explored.In this work, we first conduct a systematic analysis of robustness in radar-camera detection on five kinds of noises and propose RobuRCDet, a robust object detection model in BEV.Specifically, we design a 3D Gaussian Expansion (3DGE) module to mitigate inaccuracies in radar points, including position, Radar Cross-Section (RCS), and velocity.The 3DGE uses RCS and velocity priors to generate a deformable kernel map and variance for kernel size adjustment and value distribution.Additionally, we introduce a weather-adaptive fusion module, which adaptively fuses radar and camera features based on camera signal confidence.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on the popular benchmark, nuScenes, show that our model achieves competitive results in regular and noisy conditions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.625</span></span></p>

Using the same constraint information, we show a stronger guarantee of anytime constraint satisfaction $g(x_t)\leq 0\ \forall t\in [T]$, and matching $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret guarantees.These contributions are thanks to our approach of using Polyak feasibility steps to ensure constraint satisfaction, without sacrificing regret.Specifically, after each step of online gradient descent, our algorithm applies a subgradient descent step on the constraint function where the step-size is chosen according to the celebrated Polyak step-size.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We further validate this approach with numerical experiments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.711</span></span></p>

                  <p>Multi-task learning enables the acquisition of task-generic knowledge by training multiple tasks within a unified architecture.However, training all tasks together in a single architecture can lead to performance degradation, known as negative transfer, which is a main concern in multi-task learning.Previous works have addressed this issue by optimizing the multi-task network through gradient manipulation or weighted loss adjustments.However, their optimization strategy focuses on addressing task imbalance in shared parameters, neglecting the learning of task-specific parameters.As a result, they show limitations in mitigating negative transfer, since the learning of shared space and task-specific information influences each other during optimization.To address this, we propose a different approach to enhance multi-task performance by selectively grouping tasks and updating them for each batch during optimization.We introduce an algorithm that adaptively determines how to effectively group tasks and update them during the learning process.To track inter-task relations and optimize multi-task networks simultaneously, we propose proximal inter-task affinity, which can be measured during the optimization process.We provide a theoretical analysis on how dividing tasks into multiple groups and updating them sequentially significantly affects multi-task performance by enhancing the learning of task-specific parameters.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our methods substantially outperform previous multi-task optimization approaches and are scalable to different architectures and various numbers of tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.629</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a range of text-generation tasks.However, LLMs still struggle with problems requiring multi-step decision-making and environmental feedback, such as online shopping, scientific reasoning, and mathematical problem-solving.Unlike pure text data, collecting large-scale decision-making data is challenging.Moreover, many powerful LLMs are only accessible through APIs, which hinders their fine-tuning for agent tasks due to cost and complexity.To address LLM agents' limitations, we propose a framework that can automatically learn a reward model from the environment without human annotations.This model can be used to evaluate the action trajectories of LLM agents and provide heuristics for task planning.Specifically, our approach involves employing one LLM-based agent to navigate an environment randomly, generating diverse action trajectories.Subsequently, a separate LLM is leveraged to assign a task intent and synthesize a negative response alongside the correct response for each trajectory.These triplets (task intent, positive response, and negative response) are then utilized as training data to optimize a reward model capable of scoring action trajectories.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The effectiveness and generalizability of our framework are demonstrated through evaluations conducted on different agent benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.61</span></span>In conclusion, our proposed framework represents a significant advancement in enhancing LLM agents' decision-making capabilities.By automating the learning of reward models, we overcome the challenges of data scarcity and API limitations, potentially revolutionizing the application of LLMs in complex and interactive environments.This research paves the way for more sophisticated AI agents capable of tackling a wide range of real-world problems requiring multi-step decision-making.</p>

                  <p>This paper addresses generalized category discovery (GCD), the task of clustering unlabeled data from potentially known or unknown categories with the help of labeled instances from each known category.Compared to traditional semi-supervised learning, GCD is more challenging because unlabeled data could be from novel categories not appearing in labeled data.Current state-of-the-art methods typically learn a parametric classifier assisted by self-distillation.While being effective, these methods do not make use of cross-instance similarity to discover class-specific semantics which are essential for representation learning and category discovery.In this paper, we revisit the association-based paradigm and propose a Prior-constrained Association Learning method to capture and learn the semantic relations within data.In particular, the labeled data from known categories provides a unique prior for the association of unlabeled data.Unlike previous methods that only adopts the prior as a pre or post-clustering refinement, we fully incorporate the prior into the association process, and let it constrain the association towards a reliable grouping outcome.The estimated semantic groups are utilized through non-parametric prototypical contrast to enhance the representation learning.A further combination of both parametric and non-parametric classification complements each other and leads to a model that outperforms existing methods by a significant margin.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>On multiple GCD benchmarks, we perform extensive experiments and validate the effectiveness of our proposed method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.697</span></span></p>

                  <p>We address the challenge of developing a generalizable neural tracking controller for dexterous manipulation from human references.This controller aims to manage a dexterous robot hand to manipulate diverse objects for various purposes defined by kinematic human-object interactions.Developing such a controller is complicated by the intricate contact dynamics of dexterous manipulation and the need for adaptivity, generalizability, and robustness.Current reinforcement learning and trajectory optimization methods often fall short due to their dependence on task-specific rewards or precise system models.We introduce an approach that curates large-scale successful robot tracking demonstrations, comprising pairs of human references and robot actions, to train a neural controller.Utilizing a data flywheel, we iteratively enhance the controller's performance, as well as the number and quality of successful tracking demonstrations.We exploit available tracking demonstrations and carefully integrate reinforcement learning and imitation learning to boost the controller's performance in dynamic environments.At the same time, to obtain high-quality tracking demonstrations, we individually optimize per-trajectory tracking by leveraging the learned tracking controller in a homotopy optimization method.The homotopy optimization, mimicking chain-of-thought, aids in solving challenging trajectory tracking problems to increase demonstration diversity.We showcase our success by training a generalizable neural controller and evaluating it in both simulation and real world.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our method achieves over a 10% improvement in success rates compared to leading baselines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.708</span></span>The project website with animated results is available at https://meowuu7.github.io/DexTrack/.</p>

To more effectively tackle the problem of S2R quality annotation, we propose a new technique called AstroBR, which leverages the language understanding capabilities of LLMs to identify and extract the S2Rs from bug reports and map them to GUI interactions in a program state model derived via dynamic analysis.We compared AstroBR to a related state-of-the-art approach and we found that AstroBR annotates S2Rs 25.2% better (in terms of F1 score) than the baseline.Additionally, AstroBR suggests more accurate missing S2Rs than the baseline (by 71.4% in terms of F1 score).</p>

To address these challenges, we propose a curation pipeline designed to enhance the quality of the largest publicly available code review dataset.We begin by establishing an evaluation framework, incorporating specific criteria and categories to empirically study the initial quality of the dataset.Using a large language model (LLM)-driven approach, we then apply our curation pipeline to refine the dataset.A comparative analysis of the newly curated dataset, based on the same evaluation framework, demonstrates substantial improvements in the clarity and conciseness of the comments.Additionally, we assess the impact of the curated dataset on automating downstream tasks, specifically comment generation and code refinement.Our findings show that the curated dataset leads to enhanced model performance in generating more accurate comments.Curated comments are also more useful as they lead to more accurate code refinement.</p>

                  <p>The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 with Extended Reality (XR) technologies offers the potential to build truly immersive XR environments that interact with human users through natural language, e.g., generating and animating 3D scenes from audio inputs.However, the complexity of XR environments makes it difficult to accurately extract relevant contextual data and scene/object parameters from an overwhelming volume of XR artifacts.It leads to not only increased costs with pay-per-use models, but also elevated levels of generation errors.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, existing approaches focusing on coding script generation are often prone to generation errors, resulting in flawed or invalid scripts, application crashes, and ultimately a degraded user experience. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.64</span></span>To overcome these challenges, we introduce LLMER, a novel framework that creates interactive XR worlds using JSON data generated by LLMs.Unlike prior approaches focusing on coding script generation, LLMER translates natural language inputs into JSON data, significantly reducing the likelihood of application crashes and processing latency.It employs a multi-stage strategy to supply only the essential contextual information adapted to the user's request and features multiple modules designed for various XR tasks.Our preliminary user study reveals the effectiveness of the proposed system, with over 80% reduction in consumed tokens and around 60% reduction in task completion time compared to state-of-the-art approaches.The analysis of users' feedback also illuminates a series of directions for further optimization.</p>
