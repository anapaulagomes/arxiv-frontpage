                  <p>Large Language Model (LLM)-based generative recommendation has achieved notable success, yet its practical deployment is costly particularly due to excessive inference latency caused by autoregressive decoding.For lossless LLM decoding acceleration, Speculative Decoding (SD) has emerged as a promising solution.However, applying SD to generative recommendation presents unique challenges due to the requirement of generating top-K items (i.e., K distinct token sequences) as a recommendation list by beam search.This leads to more stringent verification in SD, where all the top-K sequences from the target LLM must be successfully drafted by the draft model at each decoding step.To alleviate this, we consider 1) boosting top-K sequence alignment between the draft model and the target LLM, and 2) relaxing the verification strategy to reduce trivial LLM calls.To this end, we propose an alignment framework named AtSpeed, which presents the AtSpeed-S optimization objective for top-K alignment under the strict top-K verification.Moreover, we introduce a relaxed sampling verification strategy that allows high-probability non-top-K drafted sequences to be accepted, significantly reducing LLM calls.Correspondingly, we propose AtSpeed-R for top-K alignment under this relaxed sampling verification.Empirical results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that AtSpeed significantly accelerates LLM-based generative recommendation, e.g., near 2x speedup under strict top-K verification and up to 2.5 speedup under relaxed sampling verification.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The codes and datasets will be released in the near future. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.847</span></span></p>

                  <p>Understanding long text is of great demands in practice but beyond the reach of most language-image pre-training (LIP) models.In this work, we empirically confirm that the key reason causing such an issue is that the training images are usually paired with short captions, leaving certain tokens easily overshadowed by salient tokens.Towards this problem, our initial attempt is to relabel the data with long captions, however, directly learning with which may lead to performance degradation in understanding short text (e.g., in the image classification task).Then, after incorporating corner tokens to aggregate diverse textual information, we manage to help the model catch up to its original level of short text understanding yet greatly enhance its capability of long text understanding.We further look into whether the model can continuously benefit from longer captions and notice a clear trade-off between the performance and the efficiency.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our approach using a self-constructed large-scale dataset, which consists of 100M long caption oriented text-image pairs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.822</span></span>It is noteworthy that, on the task of long-text image retrieval, we beat the competitor using long captions with 11.1% improvement (i.e., from 72.62% to 83.72%).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We will release the code, the model, and the new dataset to facilitate the reproducibility and further research. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.799</span></span>The project page is available at https://wuw2019.github.io/lotlip.</p>

                  <p>Transformer-based models have revolutionized the field of natural language processing.To understand why they perform so well and to assess their reliability, several studies have focused on questions such as: Which linguistic properties are encoded by these models, and to what extent?How robust are these models in encoding linguistic properties when faced with perturbations in the input text?However, these studies have mainly focused on BERT and the English language.In this paper, we investigate similar questions regarding encoding capability and robustness for 8 linguistic properties across 13 different perturbations in 6 Indic languages, using 9 multilingual Transformer models (7 universal and 2 Indic-specific).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To conduct this study, we introduce a novel multilingual benchmark dataset, IndicSentEval, containing approximately $\sim$47K sentences. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.837</span></span>Surprisingly, our probing analysis of surface, syntactic, and semantic properties reveals that while almost all multilingual models demonstrate consistent encoding performance for English, they show mixed results for Indic languages.As expected, Indic-specific multilingual models capture linguistic properties in Indic languages better than universal models.Intriguingly, universal models broadly exhibit better robustness compared to Indic-specific models, particularly under perturbations such as dropping both nouns and verbs, dropping only verbs, or keeping only nouns.Overall, this study provides valuable insights into probing and perturbation-specific strengths and weaknesses of popular multilingual Transformer-based models for different Indic languages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We make our code and dataset publicly available [https://tinyurl.com/IndicSentEval}]. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.845</span></span></p>

                  <p>Learning motor skills for sports or performance driving is often done with professional instruction from expert human teachers, whose availability is limited.Our goal is to enable automated teaching via a learned model that interacts with the student similar to a human teacher.However, training such automated teaching systems is limited by the availability of high-quality annotated datasets of expert teacher and student interactions that are difficult to collect at scale.To address this data scarcity problem, we propose an approach for training a coaching system for complex motor tasks such as high performance driving via a Multi-Task Imitation Learning (MTIL) paradigm.MTIL allows our model to learn robust representations by utilizing self-supervised training signals from more readily available non-interactive datasets of humans performing the task of interest.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We validate our approach with (1) a semi-synthetic dataset created from real human driving trajectories, (2) a professional track driving instruction dataset, (3) <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.705</span></span>a track-racing driving simulator human-subject study, and (4) a system demonstration on an instrumented car at a race track.Our experiments show that the right set of auxiliary machine learning tasks improves performance in predicting teaching instructions.Moreover, in the human subjects study, students exposed to the instructions from our teaching system improve their ability to stay within track limits, and show favorable perception of the model's interaction with them, in terms of usefulness and satisfaction.</p>

                  <p>The stark contrast in the design philosophy of an event camera makes it particularly ideal for operating under high-speed, high dynamic range and low-light conditions, where standard cameras underperform.Nonetheless, event cameras still suffer from some amount of motion blur, especially under these challenging conditions, in contrary to what most think.This is attributed to the limited bandwidth of the event sensor pixel, which is mostly proportional to the light intensity.Thus, to ensure that event cameras can truly excel in such conditions where it has an edge over standard cameras, it is crucial to account for event motion blur in downstream applications, especially reconstruction.However, none of the recent works on reconstructing Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) from events, nor event simulators, have considered the full effects of event motion blur.To this end, we propose, Deblur e-NeRF, a novel method to directly and effectively reconstruct blur-minimal NeRFs from motion-blurred events generated under high-speed motion or low-light conditions.The core component of this work is a physically-accurate pixel bandwidth model proposed to account for event motion blur under arbitrary speed and lighting conditions.We also introduce a novel threshold-normalized total variation loss to improve the regularization of large textureless patches.Experiments on real and novel realistically simulated sequences verify our effectiveness.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code, event simulator and synthetic event dataset will be open-sourced. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.843</span></span></p>

                  <p>The various limitations of Generative AI, such as hallucinations and model failures, have made it crucial to understand the role of different modalities in Visual Language Model (VLM) predictions.Our work investigates how the integration of information from image and text modalities influences the performance and behavior of VLMs in visual question answering (VQA) and reasoning tasks.We measure this effect through answer accuracy, reasoning quality, model uncertainty, and modality relevance.We study the interplay between text and image modalities in different configurations where visual content is essential for solving the VQA task.Our contributions include (1) the Semantic Interventions (SI)-VQA dataset, (2) a benchmark study of various VLM architectures under different modality configurations, and (3) the Interactive Semantic Interventions (ISI) tool.The SI-VQA dataset serves as the foundation for the benchmark, while the ISI tool provides an interface to test and apply semantic interventions in image and text inputs, enabling more fine-grained analysis.Our results show that complementary information between modalities improves answer and reasoning quality, while contradictory information harms model performance and confidence.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Image text annotations have minimal impact on accuracy and uncertainty, slightly increasing image relevance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span>Attention analysis confirms the dominant role of image inputs over text in VQA tasks.In this study, we evaluate state-of-the-art VLMs that allow us to extract attention coefficients for each modality.A key finding is PaliGemma's harmful overconfidence, which poses a higher risk of silent failures compared to the LLaVA models.This work sets the foundation for rigorous analysis of modality integration, supported by datasets specifically designed for this purpose.</p>

                  <p>Influence functions provide a principled method to assess the contribution of individual training samples to a specific target.Yet, their high computational costs limit their applications on large-scale models and datasets.Existing methods proposed for influence function approximation have significantly reduced the computational overheads.However, they mostly suffer from inaccurate estimation due to the lack of strong convergence guarantees from the algorithm.The family of hyperpower methods are well-known for their rigorous convergence guarantees on matrix inverse approximation, while the matrix multiplication operation can involve intractable memory and computation costs on large-scale models.We propose HyperINF, an efficient and accurate influence function approximation method which leverages the hyperpower method, specifically Schulz's iterative algorithm.   To deal with the computation-intensive matrix multiplication, we incorporate the generalized fisher information (GFIM) as a low-rank approximation of the Hessian matrix, which reduces the memory and computation overheads to constant costs independent of ranks on LoRA-tuned models.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We first demonstrate the superior accuracy and stability of \method compared to other baselines through a synthetic convergence simulation for matrix inversion. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.656</span></span>We further validate the efficacy of \method through extensive real-world data attribution tasks, including mislabeled data detection and data selection for LLM and VLM fine-tuning.

                  <p>Large Language Model (LLM)-based generative recommendation has achieved notable success, yet its practical deployment is costly particularly due to excessive inference latency caused by autoregressive decoding.For lossless LLM decoding acceleration, Speculative Decoding (SD) has emerged as a promising solution.However, applying SD to generative recommendation presents unique challenges due to the requirement of generating top-K items (i.e., K distinct token sequences) as a recommendation list by beam search.This leads to more stringent verification in SD, where all the top-K sequences from the target LLM must be successfully drafted by the draft model at each decoding step.To alleviate this, we consider 1) boosting top-K sequence alignment between the draft model and the target LLM, and 2) relaxing the verification strategy to reduce trivial LLM calls.To this end, we propose an alignment framework named AtSpeed, which presents the AtSpeed-S optimization objective for top-K alignment under the strict top-K verification.Moreover, we introduce a relaxed sampling verification strategy that allows high-probability non-top-K drafted sequences to be accepted, significantly reducing LLM calls.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Correspondingly, we propose AtSpeed-R for top-K alignment under this relaxed sampling verification. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span>Empirical results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that AtSpeed significantly accelerates LLM-based generative recommendation, e.g., near 2x speedup under strict top-K verification and up to 2.5 speedup under relaxed sampling verification.The codes and datasets will be released in the near future.</p>

                  <p>With significant efforts in recent studies, LLM-as-a-Judge has become a cost-effective alternative to human evaluation for assessing the text generation quality in a wide range of tasks.However, there still remains a reliability gap between LLM-as-a-Judge and human evaluation.One important reason is the lack of guided oracles in the evaluation process.Motivated by the role of reference pervasively used in classic text evaluation, we introduce RevisEval, a novel text generation evaluation paradigm via the response-adapted references.RevisEval is driven by the key observation that an ideal reference should maintain the necessary relevance to the response to be evaluated.Specifically, RevisEval leverages the text revision capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to adaptively revise the response, then treat the revised text as the reference (response-adapted reference) for the subsequent evaluation.Extensive experiments demonstrate that RevisEval outperforms traditional reference-free and reference-based evaluation paradigms that use LLM-as-a-Judge across NLG tasks and open-ended instruction-following tasks.More importantly, our response-adapted references can further boost the classical text metrics, e.g., BLEU and BERTScore, compared to traditional references and even rival the LLM-as-a-Judge.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A detailed analysis is also conducted to confirm RevisEval's effectiveness in bias reduction, the impact of inference cost, and reference relevance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.612</span></span></p>

                  <p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) methods are emerging as a way to fine-tune diffusion models (DMs) for visual generation.However, commonly used on-policy strategies are limited by the generalization capability of the reward model, while off-policy approaches require large amounts of difficult-to-obtain paired human-annotated data, particularly in visual generation tasks.To address the limitations of both on- and off-policy RLHF, we propose a preference optimization method that aligns DMs with preferences without relying on reward models or paired human-annotated data.Specifically, we introduce a Semi-Policy Preference Optimization (SePPO) method.SePPO leverages previous checkpoints as reference models while using them to generate on-policy reference samples, which replace "losing images" in preference pairs.This approach allows us to optimize using only off-policy "winning images."Furthermore, we design a strategy for reference model selection that expands the exploration in the policy space.Notably, we do not simply treat reference samples as negative examples for learning.Instead, we design an anchor-based criterion to assess whether the reference samples are likely to be winning or losing images, allowing the model to selectively learn from the generated reference samples.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This approach mitigates performance degradation caused by the uncertainty in reference sample quality. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span>We validate SePPO across both text-to-image and text-to-video benchmarks.SePPO surpasses all previous approaches on the text-to-image benchmarks and also demonstrates outstanding performance on the text-to-video benchmarks.Code will be released in https://github.com/DwanZhang-AI/SePPO.</p>

                  <p>Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) struggles with sample inefficiency and poor generalization[1].These challenges are partially due to a lack of structure or inductive bias in the neural networks typically used in learning the policy.One such form of structure that is commonly observed in multi-agent scenarios is symmetry.The field of Geometric Deep Learning has developed Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (EGNN) that are equivariant (or symmetric) to rotations, translations, and reflections of nodes.Incorporating equivariance has been shown to improve learning efficiency and decrease error [ 2 ].In this paper, we demonstrate that EGNNs improve the sample efficiency and generalization in MARL.However, we also show that a naive application of EGNNs to MARL results in poor early exploration due to a bias in the EGNN structure.To mitigate this bias, we present Exploration-enhanced Equivariant Graph Neural Networks or E2GN2.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We compare E2GN2 to other common function approximators using common MARL benchmarks MPE and SMACv2. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.704</span></span>E2GN2 demonstrates a significant improvement in sample efficiency, greater final reward convergence, and a 2x-5x gain in over standard GNNs in our generalization tests.These results pave the way for more reliable and effective solutions in complex multi-agent systems.</p>

                  <p>There have been many benchmarks for evaluating long-context language models (LCLMs), but developers often rely on synthetic tasks like needle-in-a-haystack (NIAH) or arbitrary subsets of tasks.It remains unclear whether they translate to the diverse downstream applications of LCLMs, and the inconsistency further complicates model comparison.We investigate the underlying reasons behind current practices and find that existing benchmarks often provide noisy signals due to low coverage of applications, insufficient lengths, unreliable metrics, and incompatibility with base models.In this work, we present HELMET (How to Evaluate Long-context Models Effectively and Thoroughly), a comprehensive benchmark encompassing seven diverse, application-centric categories.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also address many issues in previous benchmarks by adding controllable lengths up to 128k tokens, model-based evaluation for reliable metrics, and few-shot prompting for robustly evaluating base models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span>Consequently, we demonstrate that HELMET offers more reliable and consistent rankings of frontier LCLMs.Through a comprehensive study of 51 LCLMs, we find that (1) synthetic tasks like NIAH are not good predictors of downstream performance; (2) the diverse categories in HELMET exhibit distinct trends and low correlation with each other; and (3) while most LCLMs achieve perfect NIAH scores, open-source models significantly lag behind closed ones when the task requires full-context reasoning or following complex instructions -- the gap widens with increased lengths.Finally, we recommend using our RAG tasks for fast model development, as they are easy to run and more predictive of other downstream performance; ultimately, we advocate for a holistic evaluation across diverse tasks.</p>

                  <p>Software engineers mainly write code by editing existing programs.In contrast, large language models (LLMs) autoregressively synthesize programs in a single pass.One explanation for this is the scarcity of open-sourced edit data.While high-quality instruction data for code synthesis is already scarce, high-quality edit data is even scarcer.To fill this gap, we develop a synthetic data generation algorithm called LintSeq.This algorithm refactors existing code into a sequence of code edits by using a linter to procedurally sample across the error-free insertions that can be used to sequentially write programs.It outputs edit sequences as text strings consisting of consecutive program diffs.To test LintSeq, we use it to refactor a dataset of instruction + program pairs into instruction + program-diff-sequence tuples.Then, we instruction finetune a series of smaller LLMs ranging from 2.6B to 14B parameters on both the re-factored and original versions of this dataset, comparing zero-shot performance on code synthesis benchmarks.We show that during repeated sampling, edit sequence finetuned models produce more diverse programs than baselines.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This results in better inference-time scaling for benchmark coverage as a function of samples, i.e. the fraction of problems "pass@k" solved by any attempt given "k" tries. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.63</span></span>For example, on HumanEval pass@50, small LLMs finetuned on synthetic edit sequences are competitive with GPT-4 and outperform models finetuned on the baseline dataset by +20% (+/-3%) in absolute score.Finally, we also pretrain our own tiny LMs for code understanding.We show that finetuning tiny models on synthetic code edits results in state-of-the-art code synthesis for the on-device model class.Our 150M parameter edit sequence LM matches or outperforms code models with twice as many parameters, both with and without repeated sampling, including Codex and AlphaCode.</p>

Here we present a GROMACS implementation of a rigorous Hamiltonian interpolation $\lambda$-dynamics constant pH method, which rests on GPU-accelerated Fast Multipole Method (FMM) electrostatics.Our implementation supports both CHARMM36m and Amber99sb*-ILDN force fields and is largely automated to enable seamless switching from regular MD to constant pH MD, involving minimal changes to the input files.Here, the first of two companion papers describes the underlying constant pH protocol and sample applications to several prototypical benchmark systems such as cardiotoxin V, lysozyme, and staphylococcal nuclease.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Enhanced convergence is achieved through a new dynamic barrier height optimization method, and high p$K_a$ accuracy is demonstrated. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.654</span></span>We use Functional Mode Analysis and Mutual Information to explore the complex intra- and intermolecular couplings between the protonation states of titratable groups as well as those between protonation states and conformational dynamics.We identify striking conformation-dependent p$K_a$ variations and unexpected inter-residue couplings.Conformation-protonation coupling is identified as a primary cause of the slow protonation convergence notorious to constant pH simulations involving multiple titratable groups, suggesting enhanced sampling methods to accelerate convergence.</p>

                  <p>Remote sensing image plays an irreplaceable role in fields such as agriculture, water resources, military, and disaster relief.Pixel-level interpretation is a critical aspect of remote sensing image applications; however, a prevalent limitation remains the need for extensive manual annotation.For this, we try to introduce open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) into the remote sensing context.However, due to the sensitivity of remote sensing images to low-resolution features, distorted target shapes and ill-fitting boundaries are exhibited in the prediction mask.To tackle this issue, we propose a simple and general upsampler, SimFeatUp, to restore lost spatial information in deep features in a training-free style.Further, based on the observation of the abnormal response of local patch tokens to [CLS] token in CLIP, we propose to execute a straightforward subtraction operation to alleviate the global bias in patch tokens.Extensive experiments are conducted on 17 remote sensing datasets spanning semantic segmentation, building extraction, road detection, and flood detection tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our method achieves an average of 5.8%, 8.2%, 4%, and 15.3% improvement over state-of-the-art methods on 4 tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.644</span></span>All codes are released.\url{https://earth-insights.github.io/SegEarth-OV}</p>

                  <p>The secretary problem is one of the fundamental problems in online decision making; a tight competitive ratio for this problem of $1/\mathrm{e} \approx 0.368$ has been known since the 1960s.Much more recently, the study of algorithms with predictions was introduced: The algorithm is equipped with a (possibly erroneous) additional piece of information upfront which can be used to improve the algorithm's performance.Complementing previous work on secretary problems with prior knowledge, we tackle the following question:   What is the weakest piece of information that allows us to break the $1/\mathrm{e}$ barrier?   To this end, we introduce the secretary problem with predicted additive gap.As in the classical problem, weights are fixed by an adversary and elements appear in random order.In contrast to previous variants of predictions, our algorithm only has access to a much weaker piece of information: an \emph{additive gap} $c$. This gap is the difference between the highest and $k$-th highest weight in the sequence.Unlike previous pieces of advice, knowing an exact additive gap does not make the problem trivial.Our contribution is twofold.First, we show that for any index $k$ and any gap $c$, we can obtain a competitive ratio of $0.4$ when knowing the exact gap (even if we do not know $k$), hence beating the prevalent bound for the classical problem by a constant.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Second, a slightly modified version of our algorithm allows to prove standard robustness-consistency properties as well as improved guarantees when knowing a range for the error of the prediction. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.63</span></span></p>
