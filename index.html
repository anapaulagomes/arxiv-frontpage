                  <p>The widespread use of chest X-rays (CXRs), coupled with a shortage of radiologists, has driven growing interest in automated CXR analysis and AI-assisted reporting.While existing vision-language models (VLMs) show promise in specific tasks such as report generation or abnormality detection, they often lack support for interactive diagnostic capabilities.In this work we present RadVLM, a compact, multitask conversational foundation model designed for CXR interpretation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To this end, we curate a large-scale instruction dataset comprising over 1 million image-instruction pairs containing both single-turn tasks -- such as report generation, abnormality classification, and visual grounding -- and multi-turn, multi-task conversational interactions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.848</span></span>After fine-tuning RadVLM on this instruction dataset, we evaluate it across different tasks along with re-implemented baseline VLMs.Our results show that RadVLM achieves state-of-the-art performance in conversational capabilities and visual grounding while remaining competitive in other radiology tasks.Ablation studies further highlight the benefit of joint training across multiple tasks, particularly for scenarios with limited annotated data.Together, these findings highlight the potential of RadVLM as a clinically relevant AI assistant, providing structured CXR interpretation and conversational capabilities to support more effective and accessible diagnostic workflows.</p>

                  <p>In code review, generating structured and relevant comments is crucial for identifying code issues and facilitating accurate code changes that ensure an efficient code review process.Well-crafted comments not only streamline the code review itself but are also essential for subsequent tasks like code refinement, where the code is modified to satisfy the input review comment.Although various AI-based approaches aimed to automate comment generation, their effectiveness remains limited by the quality of the training data.Existing code review datasets are often noisy and unrefined, posing limitations to the learning potential of AI models and hindering the automation process.   To address these challenges, we propose a curation pipeline designed to enhance the quality of the largest publicly available code review dataset.We begin by establishing an evaluation framework, incorporating specific criteria and categories to empirically study the initial quality of the dataset.Using a large language model (LLM)-driven approach, we then apply our curation pipeline to refine the dataset.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A comparative analysis of the newly curated dataset, based on the same evaluation framework, demonstrates substantial improvements in the clarity and conciseness of the comments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.819</span></span>Additionally, we assess the impact of the curated dataset on automating downstream tasks, specifically comment generation and code refinement.Our findings show that the curated dataset leads to enhanced model performance in generating more accurate comments.Curated comments are also more useful as they lead to more accurate code refinement.</p>

                  <p>Language agents have become a promising solution to complex interactive tasks.One of the key ingredients to the success of language agents is the reward model on the trajectory of the agentic workflow, which provides valuable guidance during training or inference.However, due to the lack of annotations of intermediate interactions, most existing works use an outcome reward model to optimize policies across entire trajectories.This may lead to sub-optimal policies and hinder the overall performance.To address this, we propose QLASS (Q-guided Language Agent Stepwise Search), to automatically generate annotations by estimating Q-values in a stepwise manner for open language agents.By introducing a reasoning tree and performing process reward modeling, QLASS provides effective intermediate guidance for each step.With the stepwise guidance, we propose a Q-guided generation strategy to enable language agents to better adapt to long-term value, resulting in significant performance improvement during model inference on complex interactive agent tasks.Notably, even with almost half the annotated data, QLASS retains strong performance, demonstrating its efficiency in handling limited supervision.We also empirically demonstrate that QLASS can lead to more effective decision making through qualitative analysis.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We will release our code and data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.87</span></span></p>

                  <p>Real-world open-domain questions can be complicated, particularly when answering them involves information from multiple information sources.LLMs have demonstrated impressive performance in decomposing complex tasks into simpler steps, and previous work has used it for better retrieval in support of complex questions.However, LLM's decomposition of questions is unaware of what data is available and how data is organized, often leading to a sub-optimal retrieval performance.Recent effort in agentic RAG proposes to perform retrieval in an iterative fashion, where a followup query is derived as an action based on previous rounds of retrieval.While this provides one way of interacting with the data collection, agentic RAG's exploration of data is inefficient because successive queries depend on previous results rather than being guided by the organization of available data in the collection.To address this problem, we propose an LLM-based retrieval method -- ARM, that aims to better align the question with the organization of the data collection by exploring relationships among data objects beyond matching the utterance of the query, thus leading to a retrieve-all-at-once solution for complex queries.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluated ARM on two datasets, Bird and OTT-QA. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.727</span></span>On Bird, it outperforms standard RAG with query decomposition by up to 5.2 pt in execution accuracy and agentic RAG (ReAct) by up to 15.9 pt.On OTT-QA, it achieves up to 5.5 pt and 19.3 pt higher F1 match scores compared to these approaches.</p>

                  <p>Fixing Python dependency issues is a tedious and error-prone task for developers, who must manually identify and resolve environment dependencies and version constraints of third-party modules and Python interpreters.Researchers have attempted to automate this process by relying on large knowledge graphs and database lookup tables.However, these traditional approaches face limitations due to the variety of dependency error types, large sets of possible module versions, and conflicts among transitive dependencies.This study explores the potential of using large language models (LLMs) to automatically fix dependency issues in Python programs.We introduce PLLM (pronounced "plum"), a novel technique that employs retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to help an LLM infer Python versions and required modules for a given Python file.PLLM builds a testing environment that iteratively (1) prompts the LLM for module combinations, (2) tests the suggested changes, and (3) provides feedback (error messages) to the LLM to refine the fix.This feedback cycle leverages natural language processing (NLP) to intelligently parse and interpret build error messages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We benchmark PLLM on the Gistable HG2.9K dataset, a collection of challenging single-file Python gists. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.781</span></span>We compare PLLM against two state-of-the-art automatic dependency inference approaches, namely PyEGo and ReadPyE, w.r.t.the ability to resolve dependency issues.Our results indicate that PLLM can fix more dependency issues than the two baselines, with +218 (+15.97%) more fixes over ReadPyE and +281 (+21.58%) over PyEGo.Our deeper analyses suggest that PLLM is particularly beneficial for projects with many dependencies and for specific third-party numerical and machine-learning modules.Our findings demonstrate the potential of LLM-based approaches to iteratively resolve Python dependency issues.</p>

                  <p>Identifying anatomical landmarks in 3D dental models is crucial for orthodontic treatment.Manually placing these key points is complex, time-consuming, and requires expert knowledge.While some machine learning methods have been proposed for automatic tooth landmark detection in 3D Intraoral Scans (IOS), research remains limited, with no fully end-to-end approaches that avoid teeth segmentation.   We propose CHaRNet (Conditioned Heatmap Regression Network), the first end-to-end deep learning method for tooth landmark detection in 3D IOS.Unlike traditional two-stage methods that segment teeth before detecting landmarks, CHaRNet directly detects landmarks on the input point cloud.It consists of four key modules: (1) a point cloud encoder, (2) a point cloud decoder with a heatmap regression head, (3) a teeth presence classification head, and (4) the innovative Conditioned Heatmap Regression (CHaR) module.The CHaR module refines landmark regression by leveraging teeth presence classification, enabling dynamic adaptation to cases with missing teeth and improving accuracy in complex dental models.   We evaluate CHaRNet using five point cloud learning algorithms to validate the effectiveness of the CHaR module and test it on a clinical dataset of $1,214$ annotated 3D dental models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Both the dataset and code will be publicly released to address the lack of open datasets in orthodontics, promote benchmarking, and inspire new research.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.712</span></span>CHaRNet achieves a Mean Euclidean Distance Error (MEDE) of 1.28 mm and a Mean Success Ratio (MSR) of 82.40\%, demonstrating robust performance.Notably, it excels in handling irregular dental geometries, such as models with missing teeth.This end-to-end approach streamlines orthodontic workflows, improves 3D IOS analysis precision, and facilitates efficient computer-assisted treatment planning.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at reasoning and planning when trained on chainof-thought (CoT) data, where the step-by-step thought process is explicitly outlined by text tokens.However, this results in lengthy inputs where many words support textual coherence rather than core reasoning information, and processing these inputs consumes substantial computation resources.In this work, we propose a hybrid representation of the reasoning process, where we partially abstract away the initial reasoning steps using latent discrete tokens generated by VQ-VAE, significantly reducing the length of reasoning traces.We explore the use of latent trace abstractions in two scenarios: 1) training the model from scratch for the Keys-Finding Maze problem, 2) fine-tuning LLMs on this hybrid data with an extended vocabulary including unseen latent tokens, for both logical and mathematical reasoning problems.To facilitate effective learning, we introduce a simple training procedure that randomly mixes latent and text tokens, which enables fast adaptation to new latent tokens.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our approach consistently outperforms the baselines methods in various benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.812</span></span></p>

                  <p>Software vulnerabilities are commonly detected via static analysis, penetration testing, and fuzzing.They can also be found by running unit tests - so-called vulnerability-witnessing tests - that stimulate the security-sensitive behavior with crafted inputs.Developing such tests is difficult and time-consuming; thus, automated data-driven approaches could help developers intercept vulnerabilities earlier.However, training and validating such approaches require a lot of data, which is currently scarce.This paper introduces VUTECO, a deep learning-based approach for collecting instances of vulnerability-witnessing tests from Java repositories.VUTECO carries out two tasks: (1) the "Finding" task to determine whether a test case is security-related, and (2) the "Matching" task to relate a test case to the exact vulnerability it is witnessing.VUTECO successfully addresses the Finding task, achieving perfect precision and 0.83 F0.5 score on validated test cases in VUL4J and returning 102 out of 145 (70%) correct security-related test cases from 244 open-source Java projects.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Despite showing sufficiently good performance for the Matching task - i.e., 0.86 precision and 0.68 F0.5 score - VUTECO failed to retrieve any valid match in the wild. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.608</span></span>Nevertheless, we observed that in almost all of the matches, the test case was still security-related despite being matched to the wrong vulnerability.In the end, VUTECO can help find vulnerability-witnessing tests, though the matching with the right vulnerability is yet to be solved; the findings obtained lay the stepping stone for future research on the matter.</p>

                  <p>TabPFN has emerged as a promising in-context learning model for tabular data, capable of directly predicting the labels of test samples given labeled training examples.It has demonstrated competitive performance, particularly on small-scale classification tasks.However, despite its effectiveness, TabPFN still requires further refinement in several areas, including handling high-dimensional features, aligning with downstream datasets, and scaling to larger datasets.In this paper, we revisit existing variants of TabPFN and observe that most approaches focus either on reducing bias or variance, often neglecting the need to address the other side, while also increasing inference overhead.To fill this gap, we propose Beta (Bagging and Encoder-based Fine-tuning for TabPFN Adaptation), a novel and effective method designed to minimize both bias and variance.To reduce bias, we introduce a lightweight encoder to better align downstream tasks with the pre-trained TabPFN.By increasing the number of encoders in a lightweight manner, Beta mitigate variance, thereby further improving the model's performance.Additionally, bootstrapped sampling is employed to further reduce the impact of data perturbations on the model, all while maintaining computational efficiency during inference.Our approach enhances TabPFN's ability to handle high-dimensional data and scale to larger datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results on over 200 benchmark classification datasets demonstrate that Beta either outperforms or matches state-of-the-art methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.655</span></span></p>

                  <p>At the edge, there is a high level of similarity in computing.One approach that has been proposed to enhance the efficiency of edge computing is computation reuse, which eliminates redundant computations.Edge computing is integrated with the ICN architecture, capitalizing on its inherent intelligence to facilitate computation reuse and reduce redundancies in computing operations.In many past works, ICN's ability to enable computation reuse through caching has been limited.In this context, a new approach is proposed that considers computation requests with similar input data, which yield identical results, as equivalent.This method facilitates computation reuse through caching in ICN.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The use of approximate results to reduce redundant computations without requiring high accuracy in input matching is provided. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.623</span></span>This concept is termed the Similarity Index, which effectively considers images to be similar despite minor changes in the angle of photography.The Similarity Index is determined through an algorithm known as HNSW and utilizes the SIFT descriptor to identify similar data.This approach helps reduce user latency times by providing quick access to results.The evaluation, simulated using the ndnSIM tool, showed an 86% improvement in completion time compared to scenarios without computation reuse, whereas previous works reported only a 70% improvement.To strengthen this method, an analytical model for computing request transfer considering computation reuse in ICN-based edge computing is provided.To assess the accuracy of the model, several evaluations have been conducted in the simulator by varying the parameters, resulting in a maximum error percentage of approximately 16%.</p>

                  <p>Often software engineering classes have the student concentrate on designing and planning the project but stop short of actual student team development of code.This leads to criticism by employers of new graduates that they are missing skills in working in teams and coordinating multiple overlapping changes to a code base.Additionally, students that are not actively experiencing team development are unprepared to understand and modify existing legacy-code bases written by others.This paper presents a new approach to teaching undergraduate software engineering that emphasizes not only software engineering methodology but also experiencing development as a member of a team and modifying a legacy code base.Our innovative software engineering course begins with learning the fundamentals of software engineering, followed by examining an existing framework of a social media application.The students are then grouped into multiple software teams, each focusing on a different aspect of the app.The separate teams must define requirements, design, and provide documentation on the services.Using an Agile development approach, the teams incrementally add to the code base and demonstrate features as the application evolves.Subsequent iterations of the class pick up the prior students code base, providing experience working with a legacy code base.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Preliminary results of using this approach at the university are presented in this paper including quantitative analysis. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.633</span></span>Analysis of student software submissions to the cloud-based code repository shows student engagement and contributions over the span of the course.Positive student evaluations show the effectiveness of applying the principles of software engineering to the development of a complex solution in a team environment.Keywords: Software engineering, teaching, college computer science, innovative methods, agile.</p>

                  <p>Fuzzy rough set theory is effective for processing datasets with complex attributes, supported by a solid mathematical foundation and closely linked to kernel methods in machine learning.Attribute reduction algorithms and classifiers based on fuzzy rough set theory exhibit promising performance in the analysis of high-dimensional multivariate complex data.However, most existing models operate at the finest granularity, rendering them inefficient and sensitive to noise, especially for high-dimensional big data.Thus, enhancing the robustness of fuzzy rough set models is crucial for effective feature selection.Muiti-garanularty granular-ball computing, a recent development, uses granular-balls of different sizes to adaptively represent and cover the sample space, performing learning based on these granular-balls.This paper proposes integrating multi-granularity granular-ball computing into fuzzy rough set theory, using granular-balls to replace sample points.The coarse-grained characteristics of granular-balls make the model more robust.Additionally, we propose a new method for generating granular-balls, scalable to the entire supervised method based on granular-ball computing.A forward search algorithm is used to select feature sequences by defining the correlation between features and categories through dependence functions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments demonstrate the proposed model's effectiveness and superiority over baseline methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.725</span></span></p>

                  <p>Predicting molecular properties is essential for drug discovery, and computational methods can greatly enhance this process.Molecular graphs have become a focus for representation learning, with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) widely used.However, GNNs often struggle with capturing long-range dependencies.To address this, we propose MolGraph-xLSTM, a novel graph-based xLSTM model that enhances feature extraction and effectively models molecule long-range interactions.   Our approach processes molecular graphs at two scales: atom-level and motif-level.For atom-level graphs, a GNN-based xLSTM framework with jumping knowledge extracts local features and aggregates multilayer information to capture both local and global patterns effectively.Motif-level graphs provide complementary structural information for a broader molecular view.Embeddings from both scales are refined via a multi-head mixture of experts (MHMoE), further enhancing expressiveness and performance.   We validate MolGraph-xLSTM on 10 molecular property prediction datasets, covering both classification and regression tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our model demonstrates consistent performance across all datasets, with improvements of up to 7.03% on the BBBP dataset for classification and 7.54% on the ESOL dataset for regression compared to baselines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span>On average, MolGraph-xLSTM achieves an AUROC improvement of 3.18\% for classification tasks and an RMSE reduction of 3.83\% across regression datasets compared to the baseline methods.These results confirm the effectiveness of our model, offering a promising solution for molecular representation learning for drug discovery.</p>

                  <p>Facial Emotion Recognition has emerged as increasingly pivotal in the domain of User Experience, notably within modern usability testing, as it facilitates a deeper comprehension of user satisfaction and engagement.This study aims to extend the ResEmoteNet model by employing a knowledge distillation framework to develop Mini-ResEmoteNet models - lightweight student models - tailored for usability testing.Experiments were conducted on the FER2013 and RAF-DB datasets to assess the efficacy of three student model architectures: Student Model A, Student Model B, and Student Model C. Their development involves reducing the number of feature channels in each layer of the teacher model by approximately 50%, 75%, and 87.5%.Demonstrating exceptional performance on the FER2013 dataset, Student Model A (E1) achieved a test accuracy of 76.33%, marking a 0.21% absolute improvement over EmoNeXt.Moreover, the results exhibit absolute improvements in terms of inference speed and memory usage during inference compared to the ResEmoteNet model.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The findings indicate that the proposed methods surpass other state-of-the-art approaches. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.622</span></span></p>

                  <p>Real-world open-domain questions can be complicated, particularly when answering them involves information from multiple information sources.LLMs have demonstrated impressive performance in decomposing complex tasks into simpler steps, and previous work has used it for better retrieval in support of complex questions.However, LLM's decomposition of questions is unaware of what data is available and how data is organized, often leading to a sub-optimal retrieval performance.Recent effort in agentic RAG proposes to perform retrieval in an iterative fashion, where a followup query is derived as an action based on previous rounds of retrieval.While this provides one way of interacting with the data collection, agentic RAG's exploration of data is inefficient because successive queries depend on previous results rather than being guided by the organization of available data in the collection.To address this problem, we propose an LLM-based retrieval method -- ARM, that aims to better align the question with the organization of the data collection by exploring relationships among data objects beyond matching the utterance of the query, thus leading to a retrieve-all-at-once solution for complex queries.We evaluated ARM on two datasets, Bird and OTT-QA.On Bird, it outperforms standard RAG with query decomposition by up to 5.2 pt in execution accuracy and agentic RAG (ReAct) by up to 15.9 pt.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>On OTT-QA, it achieves up to 5.5 pt and 19.3 pt higher F1 match scores compared to these approaches. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span></p>

                  <p>As one of the most promising methods in self-supervised learning, contrastive learning has achieved a series of breakthroughs across numerous fields.A predominant approach to implementing contrastive learning is applying InfoNCE loss: By capturing the similarities between pairs, InfoNCE loss enables learning the representation of data.Albeit its success, adopting InfoNCE loss requires tuning a temperature, which is a core hyperparameter for calibrating similarity scores.Despite its significance and sensitivity to performance being emphasized by several studies, searching for a valid temperature requires extensive trial-and-error-based experiments, which increases the difficulty of adopting InfoNCE loss.To address this difficulty, we propose a novel method to deploy InfoNCE loss without temperature.Specifically, we replace temperature scaling with the inverse hyperbolic tangent function, resulting in a modified InfoNCE loss.In addition to hyperparameter-free deployment, we observed that the proposed method even yielded a performance gain in contrastive learning.Our detailed theoretical analysis discovers that the current practice of temperature scaling in InfoNCE loss causes serious problems in gradient descent, whereas our method provides desirable gradient properties.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The proposed method was validated on five benchmarks on contrastive learning, yielding satisfactory results without temperature tuning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span></p>

This work studies such problems in detail.Our contributions are twofold:First, we introduce a unifying framework for privacy audits based on information-theoretic principles, modeling the audit as a bit transmission problem in a noisy channel.This formulation allows us to derive fundamental limits and develop an audit approach that yields tight privacy lower bounds for various DP protocols.Second, leveraging this framework, we demystify the method of privacy audit by one run, identifying the conditions under which single-run audits are feasible or infeasible.Our analysis provides general guidelines for conducting privacy audits and offers deeper insights into the privacy audit.   Finally, through experiments, we demonstrate that our approach produces tighter privacy lower bounds on common differentially private mechanisms while requiring significantly fewer observations.We also provide a case study illustrating that our method successfully detects privacy violations in flawed implementations of private algorithms.</p>

                  <p>Answering questions that require reasoning and aggregation across both structured (tables) and unstructured (raw text) data sources presents significant challenges.Current methods rely on fine-tuning and high-quality, human-curated data, which is difficult to obtain.Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising results for multi-hop question answering (QA) over single-source text data in a zero-shot setting, yet exploration into multi-source Table-Text QA remains limited.In this paper, we present a novel Hybrid Graph-based approach for Table-Text QA that leverages LLMs without fine-tuning.Our method constructs a unified Hybrid Graph from textual and tabular data, pruning information based on the input question to provide the LLM with relevant context concisely.We evaluate our approach on the challenging Hybrid-QA and OTT-QA datasets using state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and LLaMA-3.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our method achieves the best zero-shot performance on both datasets, improving Exact Match scores by up to 10% on Hybrid-QA and 5.4% on OTT-QA. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.617</span></span>Moreover, our approach reduces token usage by up to 53% compared to the original context.</p>

                  <p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are promising bio-inspired third-generation neural networks.Recent research has trained deep SNN models with accuracy on par with Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs).Although the event-driven and sparse nature of SNNs show potential for more energy efficient computation than ANNs, SNN neurons have internal states which evolve over time.Keeping track of SNN states can significantly increase data movement and storage requirements, potentially losing its advantages with respect to ANNs.This paper investigates the energy effects of having neuron states, and how it is influenced by the chosen mapping to realistic hardware architectures with advanced memory hierarchies.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Therefore, we develop STEMS, a mapping design space exploration tool for SNNs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span>STEMS models SNN's stateful behavior and explores intra-layer and inter-layer mapping optimizations to minimize data movement, considering both spatial and temporal SNN dimensions.Using STEMS, we show up to 12x reduction in off-chip data movement and 5x reduction in energy (on top of intra-layer optimizations), on two event-based vision SNN benchmarks.Finally, neuron states may not be needed for all SNN layers.By optimizing neuron states for one of our benchmarks, we show 20x reduction in neuron states and 1.4x better performance without accuracy loss.</p>

In traffic scenarios, this impairment can even lead to safety concerns.In this paper, we introduce an LLM-simulated immersive projection environment designed to improve this ability in autistic children while ensuring their safety.We first propose 17 design considerations across four major categories, derived from a comprehensive review of previous research.Next, we developed a system called AIroad, which leverages LLMs to simulate drivers with varying social intents, expressed through explicit multimodal social signals.AIroad helps autistic children bridge the gap in recognizing the intentions behind behaviors and learning appropriate responses through various stimuli.A user study involving 14 participants demonstrated that this technology effectively engages autistic children and leads to significant improvements in their comprehension of social affordances in traffic scenarios.Additionally, parents reported high perceived usability of the system.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These findings highlight the potential of combining LLM technology with immersive environments for the functional rehabilitation of autistic children in the future. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.697</span></span></p>

To address these challenges, we propose a curation pipeline designed to enhance the quality of the largest publicly available code review dataset.We begin by establishing an evaluation framework, incorporating specific criteria and categories to empirically study the initial quality of the dataset.Using a large language model (LLM)-driven approach, we then apply our curation pipeline to refine the dataset.A comparative analysis of the newly curated dataset, based on the same evaluation framework, demonstrates substantial improvements in the clarity and conciseness of the comments.Additionally, we assess the impact of the curated dataset on automating downstream tasks, specifically comment generation and code refinement.Our findings show that the curated dataset leads to enhanced model performance in generating more accurate comments.Curated comments are also more useful as they lead to more accurate code refinement.</p>

                  <p>While learning programming languages is crucial for software engineers, mastering the necessary tools is equally important.To facilitate this, JetBrains recently released the JetBrains Academy plugin, which customizes the IDE for learners, allowing tutors to create courses entirely within IDE.   In this work, we provide the first exploratory study of this learning format.We carried out eight one-hour interviews with students and developers who completed at least one course using the plugin, inquiring about their experience with the format, the used IDE features, and the current shortcomings.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results indicate that learning inside the IDE is overall welcomed by the learners, allowing them to study in a more realistic setting, using features such as debugging and code analysis, which are crucial for real software development. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span>With the collected results and the analysis of the current drawbacks, we aim to contribute to teaching students more practical skills.</p>
