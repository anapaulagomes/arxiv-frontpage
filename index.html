                  <p>A common use of NLP is to facilitate the understanding of large document collections, with a shift from using traditional topic models to Large Language Models.Yet the effectiveness of using LLM for large corpus understanding in real-world applications remains under-explored.This study measures the knowledge users acquire with unsupervised, supervised LLM-based exploratory approaches or traditional topic models on two datasets.While LLM-based methods generate more human-readable topics and show higher average win probabilities than traditional models for data exploration, they produce overly generic topics for domain-specific datasets that do not easily allow users to learn much about the documents.Adding human supervision to the LLM generation process improves data exploration by mitigating hallucination and over-genericity but requires greater human effort.In contrast, traditional. models like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) remain effective for exploration but are less user-friendly.We show that LLMs struggle to describe the haystack of large corpora without human help, particularly domain-specific data, and face scaling and hallucination limitations due to context length constraints.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Dataset available at https://huggingface. co/datasets/zli12321/Bills. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.876</span></span></p>

                  <p>Efficient and privacy-preserving multimodal interaction is essential as AR, VR, and modern smartphones with powerful cameras become primary interfaces for human-computer communication.Existing powerful large vision-language models (VLMs) enabling multimodal interaction often rely on cloud-based processing, raising significant concerns about (1) visual privacy by transmitting sensitive vision data to servers, and (2) their limited real-time, on-device usability.This paper explores Visual Instruction Rewriting, a novel approach that transforms multimodal instructions into text-only commands, allowing seamless integration of lightweight on-device instruction rewriter VLMs (250M parameters) with existing conversational AI systems, enhancing vision data privacy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To achieve this, we present a dataset of over 39,000 examples across 14 domains and develop a compact VLM, pretrained on image captioning datasets and fine-tuned for instruction rewriting. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.852</span></span>Experimental results, evaluated through NLG metrics such as BLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE, along with semantic parsing analysis, demonstrate that even a quantized version of the model (<500MB storage footprint) can achieve effective instruction rewriting, thus enabling privacy-focused, multimodal AI applications.</p>

                  <p>Our ability to continuously acquire, organize, and leverage knowledge is a key feature of human intelligence that AI systems must approximate to unlock their full potential.Given the challenges in continual learning with large language models (LLMs), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become the dominant way to introduce new information.However, its reliance on vector retrieval hinders its ability to mimic the dynamic and interconnected nature of human long-term memory.Recent RAG approaches augment vector embeddings with various structures like knowledge graphs to address some of these gaps, namely sense-making and associativity.However, their performance on more basic factual memory tasks drops considerably below standard RAG.We address this unintended deterioration and propose HippoRAG 2, a framework that outperforms standard RAG comprehensively on factual, sense-making, and associative memory tasks.HippoRAG 2 builds upon the Personalized PageRank algorithm used in HippoRAG and enhances it with deeper passage integration and more effective online use of an LLM.This combination pushes this RAG system closer to the effectiveness of human long-term memory, achieving a 7% improvement in associative memory tasks over the state-of-the-art embedding model while also exhibiting superior factual knowledge and sense-making memory capabilities.This work paves the way for non-parametric continual learning for LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and data will be released at https://github.com/OSU-NLP-Group/HippoRAG. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.727</span></span></p>

                  <p>Rice is one of the most widely cultivated crops globally and has been developed into numerous varieties.The quality of rice during cultivation is primarily determined by its cultivar and characteristics.Traditionally, rice classification and quality assessment rely on manual visual inspection, a process that is both time-consuming and prone to errors.However, with advancements in machine vision technology, automating rice classification and quality evaluation based on its cultivar and characteristics has become increasingly feasible, enhancing both accuracy and efficiency.This study proposes a real-time evaluation mechanism for comprehensive rice grain assessment, integrating a one-stage object detection approach, a deep convolutional neural network, and traditional machine learning techniques.The proposed framework enables rice variety identification, grain completeness grading, and grain chalkiness evaluation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The rice grain dataset used in this study comprises approximately 20,000 images from six widely cultivated rice varieties in China. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.885</span></span>Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed mechanism achieves a mean average precision (mAP) of 99.14% in the object detection task and an accuracy of 97.89% in the classification task.Furthermore, the framework attains an average accuracy of 97.56% in grain completeness grading within the same rice variety, contributing to an effective quality evaluation system.</p>

                  <p>Alignment techniques have become central to ensuring that Large Language Models (LLMs) generate outputs consistent with human values.However, existing alignment paradigms often model an averaged or monolithic preference, failing to account for the diversity of perspectives across cultures, demographics, and communities.This limitation is particularly critical in health-related scenarios, where plurality is essential due to the influence of culture, religion, personal values, and conflicting opinions.Despite progress in pluralistic alignment, no prior work has focused on health, likely due to the unavailability of publicly available datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this gap, we introduce VITAL, a new benchmark dataset comprising 13.1K value-laden situations and 5.4K multiple-choice questions focused on health, designed to assess and benchmark pluralistic alignment methodologies. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.731</span></span>Through extensive evaluation of eight LLMs of varying sizes, we demonstrate that existing pluralistic alignment techniques fall short in effectively accommodating diverse healthcare beliefs, underscoring the need for tailored AI alignment in specific domains.This work highlights the limitations of current approaches and lays the groundwork for developing health-specific alignment solutions.</p>

                  <p>Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable success across various visual-language tasks.However, existing benchmarks predominantly focus on single-image understanding, leaving the analysis of image sequences largely unexplored.To address this limitation, we introduce StripCipher, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate capabilities of LMMs to comprehend and reason over sequential images.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>StripCipher comprises a human-annotated dataset and three challenging subtasks: visual narrative comprehension, contextual frame prediction, and temporal narrative reordering. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.762</span></span>Our evaluation of $16$ state-of-the-art LMMs, including GPT-4o and Qwen2.5VL, reveals a significant performance gap compared to human capabilities, particularly in tasks that require reordering shuffled sequential images.For instance, GPT-4o achieves only 23.93% accuracy in the reordering subtask, which is 56.07% lower than human performance.Further quantitative analysis discuss several factors, such as input format of images, affecting the performance of LLMs in sequential understanding, underscoring the fundamental challenges that remain in the development of LMMs.</p>

                  <p>Recent studies have shown that Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) tend to neglect image content and over-rely on language-model priors, resulting in errors in visually grounded tasks and hallucinations.We hypothesize that this issue arises because existing VLMs are not explicitly trained to generate texts that are accurately grounded in fine-grained image details.To enhance visual feedback during VLM training, we propose S-VCO (Symmetrical Visual Contrastive Optimization), a novel finetuning objective that steers the model toward capturing important visual details and aligning them with corresponding text tokens.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To further facilitate this detailed alignment, we introduce MVC, a paired image-text dataset built by automatically filtering and augmenting visual counterfactual data to challenge the model with hard contrastive cases involving Minimal Visual Contrasts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.744</span></span>Experiments show that our method consistently improves VLM performance across diverse benchmarks covering various abilities and domains, achieving up to a 22% reduction in hallucinations, and significant gains in vision-centric and general tasks.Notably, these improvements become increasingly pronounced in benchmarks with higher visual dependency.In short, S-VCO offers a significant enhancement of VLM's visually-dependent task performance while retaining or even improving the model's general abilities.We opensource our code at https://s-vco.github.io/</p>

In this paper, we conduct an empirical study on LLM-assisted popular micro-video generation (LLMPopcorn).Specifically, we investigate the following research questions: (i) How can LLMs be effectively utilized to assist popular micro-video generation?(ii) To what extent can prompt-based enhancements optimize the LLM-generated content for higher popularity?(iii) How well do various LLMs and video generators perform in the popular micro-video generation task?By exploring these questions, we show that advanced LLMs like DeepSeek-V3 enable micro-video generation to achieve popularity comparable to human-created content.Prompt enhancements further boost popularity, and benchmarking highlights DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeek-R1 among LLMs, while LTX-Video and HunyuanVideo lead in video generation.This pioneering work advances AI-assisted micro-video creation, uncovering new research opportunities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We will release the code and datasets to support future studies. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.817</span></span></p>

                  <p>The continuous operation of Earth-orbiting satellites generates vast and ever-growing archives of Remote Sensing (RS) images.Natural language presents an intuitive interface for accessing, querying, and interpreting the data from such archives.However, existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are predominantly trained on web-scraped, noisy image-text data, exhibiting limited exposure to the specialized domain of RS.This deficiency results in poor performance on RS-specific tasks, as commonly used datasets often lack detailed, scientifically accurate textual descriptions and instead emphasize solely on attributes like date and location.To bridge this critical gap, we introduce GAIA, a novel dataset designed for multi-scale, multi-sensor, and multi-modal RS image analysis.GAIA comprises of 205,150 meticulously curated RS image-text pairs, representing a diverse range of RS modalities associated to different spatial resolutions.Unlike existing vision-language datasets in RS, GAIA specifically focuses on capturing a diverse range of RS applications, providing unique information about environmental changes, natural disasters, and various other dynamic phenomena.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset provides a spatially and temporally balanced distribution, spanning across the globe, covering the last 25 years with a balanced temporal distribution of observations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.879</span></span>GAIA's construction involved a two-stage process: (1) targeted web-scraping of images and accompanying text from reputable RS-related sources, and (2) generation of five high-quality, scientifically grounded synthetic captions for each image using carefully crafted prompts that leverage the advanced vision-language capabilities of GPT-4o.Our extensive experiments, including fine-tuning of CLIP and BLIP2 models, demonstrate that GAIA significantly improves performance on RS image classification, cross-modal retrieval and image captioning tasks.</p>

In this paper we propose the task of Negative-Aware Video Moment Retrieval (NA-VMR), which considers both moment retrieval accuracy and negative query rejection accuracy.We make the distinction between In-Domain and Out-of-Domain negative queries and provide new evaluation benchmarks for two popular video moment retrieval datasets: QVHighlights and Charades-STA.We analyse the ability of current SOTA video moment retrieval approaches to adapt to Negative-Aware Video Moment Retrieval and propose UniVTG-NA, an adaptation of UniVTG designed to tackle NA-VMR.UniVTG-NA achieves high negative rejection accuracy (avg.$98.4\%$) scores while retaining moment retrieval scores to within $3.87\%$ Recall@1.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Dataset splits and code are available at https://github.com/keflanagan/MomentofUntruth <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.774</span></span></p>

                  <p>Medical image segmentation is a crucial task in medical image analysis, but it can be very challenging especially when there are less labeled data but with large unlabeled data.Contrastive learning has proven to be effective for medical image segmentation in semi-supervised learning by constructing contrastive samples from partial pixels.However, although previous contrastive learning methods can mine semantic information from partial pixels within images, they ignore the whole context information of unlabeled images, which is very important to precise segmentation.In order to solve this problem, we propose a novel prototype contrastive learning method called Prototype Contrastive Consistency Segmentation (PCCS) for semi-supervised medical image segmentation.The core idea is to enforce the prototypes of the same semantic class to be closer and push the prototypes in different semantic classes far away from each other.Specifically, we construct a signed distance map and an uncertainty map from unlabeled images.The signed distance map is used to construct prototypes for contrastive learning, and then we estimate the prototype uncertainty from the uncertainty map as trade-off among prototypes.In order to obtain better prototypes, based on the student-teacher architecture, a new mechanism named prototype updating prototype is designed to assist in updating the prototypes for contrastive learning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, we propose an uncertainty-consistency loss to mine more reliable information from unlabeled data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.617</span></span>Extensive experiments on medical image segmentation demonstrate that PCCS achieves better segmentation performance than the state-of-the-art methods.The code is available at https://github.com/comphsh/PCCS.</p>

                  <p>RNN-Transducer (RNN-T) is a widely adopted architecture in speech recognition, integrating acoustic and language modeling in an end-to-end framework.However, the RNN-T predictor tends to over-rely on consecutive word dependencies in training data, leading to high deletion error rates, particularly with less common or out-of-domain phrases.Existing solutions, such as regularization and data augmentation, often compromise other aspects of performance.We propose SegAug, an alignment-based augmentation technique that generates contextually varied audio-text pairs with low sentence-level semantics.This method encourages the model to focus more on acoustic features while diversifying the learned textual patterns of its internal language model, thereby reducing deletion errors and enhancing overall performance.Evaluations on the LibriSpeech and Tedlium-v3 datasets demonstrate a relative WER reduction of up to 12.5% on small-scale and 6.9% on large-scale settings.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Notably, most of the improvement stems from reduced deletion errors, with relative reductions of 45.4% and 18.5%, respectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.671</span></span>These results highlight SegAug's effectiveness in improving RNN-T's robustness, offering a promising solution for enhancing speech recognition performance across diverse and challenging scenarios.</p>

                  <p>Extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) is expected to be an important technology in future sixth generation (6G) networks.Compared with conventional single-polarized XL-MIMO, where signals are transmitted and received in only one polarization direction, dual-polarized XL-MIMO systems achieve higher data rate by improving multiplexing performances, and thus are the focus of this paper.Due to enlarged aperture, near-field regions become non-negligible in XL-MIMO communications, necessitating accurate near-far field boundary characterizations.However, existing boundaries developed for single-polarized systems only consider phase or power differences across array elements while irrespective of cross-polarization discrimination (XPD) variances in dual-polarized XL-MIMO systems, deteriorating transmit covariance optimization performances.In this paper, we revisit near-far field boundaries for dual-polarized XL-MIMO systems by taking XPD differences into account, which faces the following challenge.Unlike existing near-far field boundaries, which only need to consider co-polarized channel components, deriving boundaries for dual-polarized XL-MIMO systems requires modeling joint effects of co-polarized and cross-polarized components.To address this issue, we model XPD variations across antennas and introduce a non-uniform XPD distance to complement existing near-far field boundaries.Based on the new distance criterion, we propose an efficient scheme to optimize transmit covariance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Numerical results validate our analysis and demonstrate the proposed algorithm's effectiveness. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.786</span></span></p>

                  <p>In this paper, we address the challenge of determining the layer-wise sparsity rates of large language models (LLMs) through a theoretical perspective.Specifically, we identify a critical issue of ''$\textbf{reconstruction error explosion}$'' in existing LLMs sparsification methods.This refers to the cumulative effect of reconstruction errors throughout the sparsification process, where errors from earlier layers propagate and amplify in subsequent layers.As a result, the overall reconstruction error increases significantly, leading to a substantial degradation in model performance.Through theoretical analysis, we derive a simple yet effective approach to layer-wise sparsity allocation that mitigates this issue.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our method uses a monotonically increasing arithmetic progression, reducing the process of determining sparsity rates for multiple layers to the determination of a single common difference hyperparameter. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.643</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Remarkably, this allows for the optimal layer-wise sparsity rates to be identified with just a few trials. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.657</span></span>Both our theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that this sparsity allocation scheme is near optimal.Extensive experiments show that our method significantly improves the performance of sparse LLMs across various architectures, outperforming existing layer-wise sparsity methods.Furthermore, it enhances the performance of various compression techniques and is applicable to vision and multimodal models.Notably, our method achieves a reduction of 52.10 in perplexity for the 70$\%$ sparse LLaMA2-7B model obtained via Wanda, improves average zero-shot accuracy by 10.50$\%$, and delivers speedups of 2.63$\times$ and 2.23$\times$ on CPU and GPU, respectively.</p>

                  <p>Rice is one of the most widely cultivated crops globally and has been developed into numerous varieties.The quality of rice during cultivation is primarily determined by its cultivar and characteristics.Traditionally, rice classification and quality assessment rely on manual visual inspection, a process that is both time-consuming and prone to errors.However, with advancements in machine vision technology, automating rice classification and quality evaluation based on its cultivar and characteristics has become increasingly feasible, enhancing both accuracy and efficiency.This study proposes a real-time evaluation mechanism for comprehensive rice grain assessment, integrating a one-stage object detection approach, a deep convolutional neural network, and traditional machine learning techniques.The proposed framework enables rice variety identification, grain completeness grading, and grain chalkiness evaluation.The rice grain dataset used in this study comprises approximately 20,000 images from six widely cultivated rice varieties in China.Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed mechanism achieves a mean average precision (mAP) of 99.14% in the object detection task and an accuracy of 97.89% in the classification task.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, the framework attains an average accuracy of 97.56% in grain completeness grading within the same rice variety, contributing to an effective quality evaluation system. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.608</span></span></p>

                  <p>Indices for approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) are a basic component for information retrieval and widely used in database, search, recommendation and RAG systems.In these scenarios, documents or other objects are inserted into and deleted from the working set at a high rate, requiring a stream of updates to the vector index.Algorithms based on proximity graph indices are the most efficient indices for ANNS, winning many benchmark competitions.However, it is challenging to update such graph index at a high rate, while supporting stable recall after many updates.Since the graph is singly-linked, deletions are hard because there is no fast way to find in-neighbors of a deleted vertex.Therefore, to update the graph, state-of-the-art algorithms such as FreshDiskANN accumulate deletions in a batch and periodically consolidate, removing edges to deleted vertices and modifying the graph to ensure recall stability.In this paper, we present IP-DiskANN (InPlaceUpdate-DiskANN), the first algorithm to avoid batch consolidation by efficiently processing each insertion and deletion in-place.Our experiments using standard benchmarks show that IP-DiskANN has stable recall over various lengthy update patterns in both high-recall and low-recall regimes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Further, its query throughput and update speed are better than using the batch consolidation algorithm and HNSW. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span></p>

                  <p>Referring Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT) is a relatively new concept that has rapidly gained traction as a promising research direction at the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing.Unlike traditional multi-object tracking, RMOT identifies and tracks objects and incorporates textual descriptions for object class names, making the approach more intuitive.Various techniques have been proposed to address this challenging problem; however, most require the training of the entire network due to their end-to-end nature.Among these methods, iKUN has emerged as a particularly promising solution.Therefore, we further explore its pipeline and enhance its performance.In this paper, we introduce a practical module dubbed Memory-Efficient Cross-modality -- MEX.This memory-efficient technique can be directly applied to off-the-shelf trackers like iKUN, resulting in significant architectural improvements.Our method proves effective during inference on a single GPU with 4 GB of memory.Among the various benchmarks, the Refer-KITTI dataset, which offers diverse autonomous driving scenes with relevant language expressions, is particularly useful for studying this problem.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Empirically, our method demonstrates effectiveness and efficiency regarding HOTA tracking scores, substantially improving memory allocation and processing speed. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span></p>

                  <p>Using Large Language Models (LLMs) for relevance assessments offers promising opportunities to improve Information Retrieval (IR), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and related fields.Indeed, LLMs hold the promise of allowing IR experimenters to build evaluation collections with a fraction of the manual human labor currently required.This could help with fresh topics on which there is still limited knowledge and could mitigate the challenges of evaluating ranking systems in low-resource scenarios, where it is challenging to find human annotators.Given the fast-paced recent developments in the domain, many questions concerning LLMs as assessors are yet to be answered.Among the aspects that require further investigation, we can list the impact of various components in a relevance judgment generation pipeline, such as the prompt used or the LLM chosen.   This paper benchmarks and reports on the results of a large-scale automatic relevance judgment evaluation, the LLMJudge challenge at SIGIR 2024, where different relevance assessment approaches were proposed.In detail, we release and benchmark 42 LLM-generated labels of the TREC 2023 Deep Learning track relevance judgments produced by eight international teams who participated in the challenge.Given their diverse nature, these automatically generated relevance judgments can help the community not only investigate systematic biases caused by LLMs but also explore the effectiveness of ensemble models, analyze the trade-offs between different models and human assessors, and advance methodologies for improving automated evaluation techniques.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The released resource is available at the following link: https://llm4eval.github.io/LLMJudge-benchmark/ <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.655</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent dense retrievers usually thrive on the emergency capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), using them to encode queries and documents into an embedding space for retrieval.These LLM-based dense retrievers have shown promising performance across various retrieval scenarios.However, relying on a single embedding to represent documents proves less effective in capturing different perspectives of documents for matching.In this paper, we propose Deliberate Thinking based Dense Retriever (DEBATER), which enhances these LLM-based retrievers by enabling them to learn more effective document representations through a step-by-step thinking process.DEBATER introduces the Chain-of-Deliberation mechanism to iteratively optimize document representations using a continuous chain of thought.To consolidate information from various thinking steps, DEBATER also incorporates the Self Distillation mechanism, which identifies the most informative thinking steps and integrates them into a unified text embedding.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results show that DEBATER significantly outperforms existing methods across several retrieval benchmarks, demonstrating superior accuracy and robustness. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.641</span></span>All codes are available at https://github.com/OpenBMB/DEBATER.</p>

                  <p>The continuous surge in data volume and velocity is often dealt with using data orchestration and distributed processing approaches, abstracting away the machine learning challenges that exist at the algorithmic level.With growing interest in automating the learning loop, training with data that arrive in a sequence rather than in the classical in-memory training data form will face a machine learning challenge because of evolving feature distributions across batches of training data biasing the cross-validation step (\cite{sugiyama2012machine}).This work takes a distributed density estimation angle to the problem where data are temporally distributed.It processes data in batches and allows a neural network to treat a batch as training data.The method accumulates knowledge about the data density via posterior probability absorption using the Fisher Information Matrix, which contains information about the local optimization gradients for the batch.This is then used as a regularizer for the loss in the following batch, and therefore the density estimate for the entire dataset constructively gets more robust to the non-iid distribution shift.This needs the presence of a pair of batches in memory at a time, so the space cost is not a function of the size of the complete, distributed dataset.We proposed a novel regularization-based approach Covariate Shift Correction $C^{2}A$ that leverages Fisher information and Kullback-Leibler divergence to adapt to both natural and sequential covariate shift caused by dataset fragmentation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>$C^{2}A$ achieves $19\%$ accuracy at maximum against state-of-the-art methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.674</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent years have seen significant progress in the study of dynamic graph algorithms, and most notably, the introduction of strong lower bound techniques for them (e.g., Henzinger, Krinninger, Nanongkai and Saranurak, STOC 2015; Larsen and Yu, FOCS 2023).As worst-case analysis (adversarial inputs) may lead to the necessity of high running times, a natural question arises: in which cases are high running times really necessary, and in which cases these inputs merely manifest unique pathological cases?   Early attempts to tackle this question were made by Nikoletseas, Reif, Spirakis and Yung (ICALP 1995) and by Alberts and Henzinger (Algorithmica 1998), who considered models with very little adversarial control over the inputs, and showed fast algorithms exist for them.The question was then overlooked for decades, until Henzinger, Lincoln and Saha (SODA 2022) recently addressed uniformly random inputs, and presented algorithms and impossibility results for several subgraph counting problems.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To tackle the above question more thoroughly, we employ smoothed analysis, a celebrated framework introduced by Spielman and Teng (J. ACM, 2004). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.645</span></span>An input is proposed by an adversary but then a noisy version of it is processed by the algorithm instead.Parameterized by the amount of adversarial control, this input model fully interpolates between worst-case inputs and a uniformly random input.Doing so, we extend impossibility results for some problems to the smoothed model with only a minor quantitative loss.That is, we show that partially-adversarial inputs suffice to impose high running times for certain problems.In contrast, we show that other problems become easy even with the slightest amount of noise.In addition, we study the interplay between the adversary and the noise, leading to three natural models of smoothed inputs, for which we show a hierarchy of increasing complexity.</p>

Using the same constraint information, we show a stronger guarantee of anytime constraint satisfaction $g(x_t)\leq 0\ \forall t\in [T]$, and matching $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret guarantees.These contributions are thanks to our approach of using Polyak feasibility steps to ensure constraint satisfaction, without sacrificing regret.Specifically, after each step of online gradient descent, our algorithm applies a subgradient descent step on the constraint function where the step-size is chosen according to the celebrated Polyak step-size.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We further validate this approach with numerical experiments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.711</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a range of text-generation tasks.However, LLMs still struggle with problems requiring multi-step decision-making and environmental feedback, such as online shopping, scientific reasoning, and mathematical problem-solving.Unlike pure text data, collecting large-scale decision-making data is challenging.Moreover, many powerful LLMs are only accessible through APIs, which hinders their fine-tuning for agent tasks due to cost and complexity.To address LLM agents' limitations, we propose a framework that can automatically learn a reward model from the environment without human annotations.This model can be used to evaluate the action trajectories of LLM agents and provide heuristics for task planning.Specifically, our approach involves employing one LLM-based agent to navigate an environment randomly, generating diverse action trajectories.Subsequently, a separate LLM is leveraged to assign a task intent and synthesize a negative response alongside the correct response for each trajectory.These triplets (task intent, positive response, and negative response) are then utilized as training data to optimize a reward model capable of scoring action trajectories.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The effectiveness and generalizability of our framework are demonstrated through evaluations conducted on different agent benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.61</span></span>In conclusion, our proposed framework represents a significant advancement in enhancing LLM agents' decision-making capabilities.By automating the learning of reward models, we overcome the challenges of data scarcity and API limitations, potentially revolutionizing the application of LLMs in complex and interactive environments.This research paves the way for more sophisticated AI agents capable of tackling a wide range of real-world problems requiring multi-step decision-making.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models have demonstrated superior performance across a wide range of tasks, but they still exhibit undesirable errors due to incorrect knowledge learned from the training data.To avoid this, knowledge editing methods emerged to precisely edit the specific model knowledge via efficiently modifying a very small percentage of parameters.% However, those methods can lead to the problem of Specificity Failure: when the content related to the edited knowledge occurs in the context, it can inadvertently corrupt other pre-existing knowledge.However, those methods can lead to the problem of Specificity Failure, where the existing knowledge and capabilities are severely degraded due to editing.Our preliminary indicates that Specificity Failure primarily stems from the model's attention heads assigning excessive attention scores to entities related to the edited knowledge, thereby unduly focusing on specific snippets within the context, which we denote as the Attention Drift phenomenon.To mitigate such Attention Drift issue, we introduce a simple yet effective method Selective Attention Drift Restriction}(SADR), which introduces an additional regularization term during the knowledge editing process to restrict changes in the attention weight distribution, thereby preventing undue focus on the edited entity.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments on five frequently used strong LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, where SADR can significantly mitigate Specificity Failure in the predominant knowledge editing tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.7</span></span></p>

                  <p>Speculative sampling has emerged as an important technique for accelerating the auto-regressive generation process of large language models (LLMs) by utilizing a draft-then-verify mechanism to produce multiple tokens per forward pass.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While state-of-the-art speculative sampling methods use only a single layer and a language modeling (LM) head as the draft model to achieve impressive layer compression, their efficiency gains are substantially reduced for large-vocabulary LLMs, such as Llama-3-8B with a vocabulary of 128k tokens. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.669</span></span>To address this, we present FR-Spec, a frequency-ranked speculative sampling framework that optimizes draft candidate selection through vocabulary space compression.By constraining the draft search to a frequency-prioritized token subset, our method reduces LM Head computation overhead by 75% while ensuring the equivalence of the final output distribution.Experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate an average of 1.12$\times$ speedup over the state-of-the-art speculative sampling method EAGLE-2.</p>

To more effectively tackle the problem of S2R quality annotation, we propose a new technique called AstroBR, which leverages the language understanding capabilities of LLMs to identify and extract the S2Rs from bug reports and map them to GUI interactions in a program state model derived via dynamic analysis.We compared AstroBR to a related state-of-the-art approach and we found that AstroBR annotates S2Rs 25.2% better (in terms of F1 score) than the baseline.Additionally, AstroBR suggests more accurate missing S2Rs than the baseline (by 71.4% in terms of F1 score).</p>

To address these challenges, we propose a curation pipeline designed to enhance the quality of the largest publicly available code review dataset.We begin by establishing an evaluation framework, incorporating specific criteria and categories to empirically study the initial quality of the dataset.Using a large language model (LLM)-driven approach, we then apply our curation pipeline to refine the dataset.A comparative analysis of the newly curated dataset, based on the same evaluation framework, demonstrates substantial improvements in the clarity and conciseness of the comments.Additionally, we assess the impact of the curated dataset on automating downstream tasks, specifically comment generation and code refinement.Our findings show that the curated dataset leads to enhanced model performance in generating more accurate comments.Curated comments are also more useful as they lead to more accurate code refinement.</p>
