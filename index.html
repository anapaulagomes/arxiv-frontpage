                  <p>Voice signals originating from the respiratory tract are utilized as valuable acoustic biomarkers for the diagnosis and assessment of respiratory diseases.Among the employed acoustic features, Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) is widely used for automatic analysis, with MFCC extraction commonly relying on default parameters.However, no comprehensive study has systematically investigated the impact of MFCC extraction parameters on respiratory disease diagnosis.In this study, we address this gap by examining the effects of key parameters, namely the number of coefficients, frame length, and hop length between frames, on respiratory condition examination.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our investigation uses four datasets: the Cambridge COVID-19 Sound database, the Coswara dataset, the Saarbrucken Voice Disorders (SVD) database, and a TACTICAS dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.932</span></span>The Support Vector Machine (SVM) is employed as the classifier, given its widespread adoption and efficacy.Our findings indicate that the accuracy of MFCC decreases as hop length increases, and the optimal number of coefficients is observed to be approximately 30.The performance of MFCC varies with frame length across the datasets: for the COVID-19 datasets (Cambridge COVID-19 Sound database and Coswara dataset), performance declines with longer frame lengths, while for the SVD dataset, performance improves with increasing frame length (from 50 ms to 500 ms).Furthermore, we investigate the optimized combination of these parameters and observe substantial enhancements in accuracy.Compared to the worst combination, the SVM model achieves an accuracy of 81.1%, 80.6%, and 71.7%, with improvements of 19.6%, 16.10%, and 14.90% for the Cambridge COVID-19 Sound database, the Coswara dataset, and the SVD dataset respectively.</p>

                  <p>We introduce FruitNeRF, a unified novel fruit counting framework that leverages state-of-the-art view synthesis methods to count any fruit type directly in 3D.Our framework takes an unordered set of posed images captured by a monocular camera and segments fruit in each image.To make our system independent of the fruit type, we employ a foundation model that generates binary segmentation masks for any fruit.Utilizing both modalities, RGB and semantic, we train a semantic neural radiance field.Through uniform volume sampling of the implicit Fruit Field, we obtain fruit-only point clouds.By applying cascaded clustering on the extracted point cloud, our approach achieves precise fruit count.The use of neural radiance fields provides significant advantages over conventional methods such as object tracking or optical flow, as the counting itself is lifted into 3D.Our method prevents double counting fruit and avoids counting irrelevant fruit.We evaluate our methodology using both real-world and synthetic datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The real-world dataset consists of three apple trees with manually counted ground truths, a benchmark apple dataset with one row and ground truth fruit location, while the synthetic dataset comprises various fruit types including apple, plum, lemon, pear, peach, and mango. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.721</span></span>Additionally, we assess the performance of fruit counting using the foundation model compared to a U-Net.</p>

                  <p>Moving object segmentation (MOS) using a 3D light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensor is crucial for scene understanding and identification of moving objects.Despite the availability of various types of 3D LiDAR sensors in the market, MOS research still predominantly focuses on 3D point clouds from mechanically spinning omnidirectional LiDAR sensors.Thus, we are, for example, lacking a dataset with MOS labels for point clouds from solid-state LiDAR sensors which have irregular scanning patterns.In this paper, we present a labeled dataset, called \textit{HeLiMOS}, that enables to test MOS approaches on four heterogeneous LiDAR sensors, including two solid-state LiDAR sensors.Furthermore, we introduce a novel automatic labeling method to substantially reduce the labeling effort required from human annotators.To this end, our framework exploits an instance-aware static map building approach and tracking-based false label filtering.Finally, we provide experimental results regarding the performance of commonly used state-of-the-art MOS approaches on HeLiMOS that suggest a new direction for a sensor-agnostic MOS, which generally works regardless of the type of LiDAR sensors used to capture 3D point clouds.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our dataset is available at https://sites.google.com/view/helimos. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.924</span></span></p>

                  <p>Standard natural language processing (NLP) pipelines operate on symbolic representations of language, which typically consist of sequences of discrete tokens.However, creating an analogous representation for ancient logographic writing systems is an extremely labor intensive process that requires expert knowledge.At present, a large portion of logographic data persists in a purely visual form due to the absence of transcription -- this issue poses a bottleneck for researchers seeking to apply NLP toolkits to study ancient logographic languages: most of the relevant data are images of writing.   This paper investigates whether direct processing of visual representations of language offers a potential solution.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We introduce LogogramNLP, the first benchmark enabling NLP analysis of ancient logographic languages, featuring both transcribed and visual datasets for four writing systems along with annotations for tasks like classification, translation, and parsing. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.731</span></span>Our experiments compare systems that employ recent visual and text encoding strategies as backbones.The results demonstrate that visual representations outperform textual representations for some investigated tasks, suggesting that visual processing pipelines may unlock a large amount of cultural heritage data of logographic languages for NLP-based analyses.</p>

                  <p>Vision transformers (ViTs) excel in computer vision for modeling long-term dependencies, yet face two key challenges for image quality assessment (IQA): discarding fine details during patch embedding, and requiring extensive training data due to lack of inductive biases.In this study, we propose a Global-Local progressive INTegration network for IQA, called GlintIQA, to address these issues through three key components: 1) Hybrid feature extraction combines ViT-based global feature extractor (VGFE) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs)-based local feature extractor (CLFE) to capture global coarse-grained features and local fine-grained features, respectively.The incorporation of CNNs mitigates the patch-level information loss and inductive bias constraints inherent to ViT architectures.2) Progressive feature integration leverages diverse kernel sizes in embedding to spatially align coarse- and fine-grained features, and progressively aggregate these features by interactively stacking channel-wise attention and spatial enhancement modules to build effective quality-aware representations.3) Content similarity-based labeling approach is proposed that automatically assigns quality labels to images with diverse content based on subjective quality scores.This addresses the scarcity of labeled training data in synthetic datasets and bolsters model generalization.The experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, yielding 5.04% average SROCC gains on cross-authentic dataset evaluations.Moreover, our model and its counterpart pre-trained on the proposed dataset respectively exhibited 5.40% and 13.23% improvements on across-synthetic datasets evaluation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The codes and proposed dataset will be released at https://github.com/XiaoqiWang/GlintIQA. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.778</span></span></p>

                  <p>In this paper, we investigate whether Large Language Models (LLMs) actively recall or retrieve their internal repositories of factual knowledge when faced with reasoning tasks.Through an analysis of LLMs' internal factual recall at each reasoning step via Knowledge Neurons, we reveal that LLMs fail to harness the critical factual associations under certain circumstances.Instead, they tend to opt for alternative, shortcut-like pathways to answer reasoning questions.By manually manipulating the recall process of parametric knowledge in LLMs, we demonstrate that enhancing this recall process directly improves reasoning performance whereas suppressing it leads to notable degradation.Furthermore, we assess the effect of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, a powerful technique for addressing complex reasoning tasks.Our findings indicate that CoT can intensify the recall of factual knowledge by encouraging LLMs to engage in orderly and reliable reasoning.Furthermore, we explored how contextual conflicts affect the retrieval of facts during the reasoning process to gain a comprehensive understanding of the factual recall behaviors of LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code and data will be available soon. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.846</span></span></p>

                  <p>The Rust programming language has garnered significant attention due to its robust safety features and memory management capabilities.Despite its guaranteed memory safety, Rust programs still suffer from runtime errors that are unmanageable, i.e., panic errors.Notably, over half of the bugs in rustc, Rust's own compiler, are attributable to crash stemming from panic errors.However, understanding root causes and resolving these panics often requires substantial effort due to the limited information provided, and the stack backtrace could be intricate, often omitting the actual fault locations.Although numerous automated program repair techniques exist, we observe that the prevailing fix patterns do not readily apply to Rust programs due to natural differences in language mechanisms.To tackle the above challenges, this paper introduces a systematic study aimed at fixing Rust panic bugs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We commence by assembling a dataset, namely Panic4R, which includes 102 real panic bugs and their fixes from the top 500 most downloaded open-source crates. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.861</span></span>By analyzing Rust's implementation, we identify Rust-specific patterns for fixing panic bugs, which can aid in understanding and providing guidance for generating patches.Finally, we design and implement the first automated fixing tool, PanicKiller, for Rust panic bugs, which effectively generates correct patches on the real-world large-scale dataset, and has already assisted in the resolution of 28 panic bugs in open-source projects.Each resolved issue has been validated by the developers and merged into the respective codebases.</p>

                  <p>This paper studies zero-shot object recognition using event camera data.Guided by CLIP, which is pre-trained on RGB images, existing approaches achieve zero-shot object recognition by maximizing embedding similarities between event data encoded by an event encoder and RGB images encoded by the CLIP image encoder.Alternatively, several methods learn RGB frame reconstructions from event data for the CLIP image encoder.However, these approaches often result in suboptimal zero-shot performance.   This study develops an event encoder without relying on additional reconstruction networks.We theoretically analyze the performance bottlenecks of previous approaches: global similarity-based objective (i.e., maximizing the embedding similarities) cause semantic misalignments between the learned event embedding space and the CLIP text embedding space due to the degree of freedom.To mitigate the issue, we explore a scalar-wise regularization strategy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, to scale up the number of events and RGB data pairs for training, we also propose a pipeline for synthesizing event data from static RGB images.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.752</span></span>Experimentally, our data synthesis strategy exhibits an attractive scaling property, and our method achieves superior zero-shot object recognition performance on extensive standard benchmark datasets, even compared with past supervised learning approaches.For example, we achieve 47.84% zero-shot accuracy on the N-ImageNet dataset.</p>

                  <p>Task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems aim to efficiently handle task-oriented conversations, including information gathering.How to utilize ToD accurately, efficiently and effectively for information gathering has always been a critical and challenging task.Recent studies have demonstrated that Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in dialogue, instruction generation, and reasoning, and can significantly enhance the performance of TOD through fine-tuning.However, current datasets primarily cater to user-led systems and are limited to predefined specific scenarios and slots, thereby necessitating improvements in the proactiveness, diversity, and capabilities of TOD.In this study, we present a detailed multi-domain task-oriented data construction process for conversations, and a Chinese dialogue dataset generated based on this process, \textbf{TransferTOD}, which authentically simulates human-machine dialogues in 30 popular life service scenarios.Leveraging this dataset, we trained a \textbf{TransferTOD-7B} model using full-parameter fine-tuning, showcasing notable abilities in slot filling and questioning.Our work has demonstrated its strong generalization capabilities in various downstream scenarios, significantly enhancing both data utilization efficiency and system performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The data is released in https://github.com/KongLongGeFDU/TransferTOD. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.713</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent research on knowledge distillation has increasingly focused on logit distillation because of its simplicity, effectiveness, and versatility in model compression.In this paper, we introduce Refined Logit Distillation (RLD) to address the limitations of current logit distillation methods.Our approach is motivated by the observation that even high-performing teacher models can make incorrect predictions, creating a conflict between the standard distillation loss and the cross-entropy loss.This conflict can undermine the consistency of the student model's learning objectives.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Previous attempts to use labels to empirically correct teacher predictions may undermine the class correlation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span>In contrast, our RLD employs labeling information to dynamically refine teacher logits.In this way, our method can effectively eliminate misleading information from the teacher while preserving crucial class correlations, thus enhancing the value and efficiency of distilled knowledge.Experimental results on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet demonstrate its superiority over existing methods.The code is provided at \text{https://github.com/zju-SWJ/RLD}.</p>

                  <p>Clinical machine learning research and AI driven clinical decision support models rely on clinically accurate labels.Manually extracting these labels with the help of clinical specialists is often time-consuming and expensive.This study tests the feasibility of automatic span- and document-level diagnosis extraction from unstructured Dutch echocardiogram reports.   We included 115,692 unstructured echocardiogram reports from the UMCU a large university hospital in the Netherlands.A randomly selected subset was manually annotated for the occurrence and severity of eleven commonly described cardiac characteristics.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We developed and tested several automatic labelling techniques at both span and document levels, using weighted and macro F1-score, precision, and recall for performance evaluation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.645</span></span>We compared the performance of span labelling against document labelling methods, which included both direct document classifiers and indirect document classifiers that rely on span classification results.   The SpanCategorizer and MedRoBERTa.nl models outperformed all other span and document classifiers, respectively.The weighted F1-score varied between characteristics, ranging from 0.60 to 0.93 in SpanCategorizer and 0.96 to 0.98 in MedRoBERTa.nl.Direct document classification was superior to indirect document classification using span classifiers.SetFit achieved competitive document classification performance using only 10\% of the training data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Utilizing a reduced label set yielded near-perfect document classification results.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.632</span></span>We recommend using our published SpanCategorizer and MedRoBERTa.nl models for span- and document-level diagnosis extraction from Dutch echocardiography reports.For settings with limited training data, SetFit may be a promising alternative for document classification.</p>

                  <p>In object detection, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain.However, UDA's reliance on labeled source data restricts its adaptability in privacy-related scenarios.This study focuses on source-free object detection (SFOD), which adapts a source-trained detector to an unlabeled target domain without using labeled source data.Recent advancements in self-training, particularly with the Mean Teacher (MT) framework, show promise for SFOD deployment.However, the absence of source supervision significantly compromises the stability of these approaches.We identify two primary issues, (1) uncontrollable degradation of the teacher model due to inopportune updates from the student model, and (2) the student model's tendency to replicate errors from incorrect pseudo labels, leading to it being trapped in a local optimum.Both factors contribute to a detrimental circular dependency, resulting in rapid performance degradation in recent self-training frameworks.To tackle these challenges, we propose the Dynamic Retraining-Updating (DRU) mechanism, which actively manages the student training and teacher updating processes to achieve co-evolutionary training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, we introduce Historical Student Loss to mitigate the influence of incorrect pseudo labels. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.661</span></span>Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in the SFOD setting on multiple domain adaptation benchmarks, comparable to or even surpassing advanced UDA methods.The code will be released at https://github.com/lbktrinh/DRU</p>

                  <p>We introduce ontology-mediated planning, in which planning problems are combined with an ontology.Our formalism differs from existing ones in that we focus on a strong separation of the formalisms for describing planning problems and ontologies, which are only losely coupled by an interface.Moreover, we present a black-box algorithm that supports the full expressive power of OWL DL.This goes beyond what existing approaches combining automated planning with ontologies can do, which only support limited description logics such as DL-Lite and description logics that are Horn.Our main algorithm relies on rewritings of the ontology-mediated planning specifications into PDDL, so that existing planning systems can be used to solve them.The algorithm relies on justifications, which allows for a generic approach that is independent of the expressivity of the ontology language.However, dedicated optimizations for computing justifications need to be implemented to enable an efficient rewriting procedure.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluated our implementation on benchmark sets from several domains. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.755</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The evaluation shows that our procedure works in practice and that tailoring the reasoning procedure has significant impact on the performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span></p>

                  <p>Experimentation is an essential method for causal inference in any empirical discipline.Crossover-design experiments are common in Software Engineering (SE) research.In these, subjects apply more than one treatment in different orders.This design increases the amount of obtained data and deals with subject variability but introduces threats to internal validity like the learning and carryover effect.Vegas et al. reviewed the state of practice for crossover designs in SE research and provided guidelines on how to address its threats during data analysis while still harnessing its benefits.In this paper, we reflect on the impact of these guidelines and review the state of analysis of crossover design experiments in SE publications between 2015 and March 2024.To this end, by conducting a forward snowballing of the guidelines, we survey 136 publications reporting 67 crossover-design experiments and evaluate their data analysis against the provided guidelines.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results show that the validity of data analyses has improved compared to the original state of analysis. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span>Still, despite the explicit guidelines, only 29.5% of all threats to validity were addressed properly.While the maturation and the optimal sequence threats are properly addressed in 35.8% and 38.8% of all studies in our sample respectively, the carryover threat is only modeled in about 3% of the observed cases.The lack of adherence to the analysis guidelines threatens the validity of the conclusions drawn from crossover design experiments</p>

                  <p>In many automated planning applications, action costs can be hard to specify.An example is the time needed to travel through a certain road segment, which depends on many factors, such as the current weather conditions.A natural way to address this issue is to learn to predict these parameters based on input features (e.g., weather forecasts) and use the predicted action costs in automated planning afterward.Decision-Focused Learning (DFL) has been successful in learning to predict the parameters of combinatorial optimization problems in a way that optimizes solution quality rather than prediction quality.This approach yields better results than treating prediction and optimization as separate tasks.In this paper, we investigate for the first time the challenges of implementing DFL for automated planning in order to learn to predict the action costs.There are two main challenges to overcome: (1) planning systems are called during gradient descent learning, to solve planning problems with negative action costs, which are not supported in planning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We propose novel methods for gradient computation to avoid this issue. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.609</span></span>(2) DFL requires repeated planner calls during training, which can limit the scalability of the method.We experiment with different methods approximating the optimal plan as well as an easy-to-implement caching mechanism to speed up the learning process.As the first work that addresses DFL for automated planning, we demonstrate that the proposed gradient computation consistently yields significantly better plans than predictions aimed at minimizing prediction error; and that caching can temper the computation requirements.</p>

                  <p>Recently, researchers have extended the concept of matchings to the more general problem of finding $b$-matchings in hypergraphs broadening the scope of potential applications and challenges.The concept of $b$-matchings, where $b$ is a function that assigns positive integers to the vertices of the graph, is a natural extension of matchings in graphs, where each vertex $v$ is allowed to be matched to up to $b(v)$ edges, rather than just one.The weighted $b$-matching problem then seeks to select a subset of the hyperedges that fulfills the constraint and maximizes the weight.   In this work, we engineer novel algorithms for this generalized problem.More precisely, we introduce exact data reductions for the problem as well as a novel greedy initial solution and local search algorithms.These data reductions allow us to significantly shrink the input size.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This is done by either determining if a hyperedge is guaranteed to be in an optimum $b$-matching and thus can be added to our solution or if it can be safely ignored. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.61</span></span>Our iterated local search algorithm provides a framework for finding suitable improvement swaps of edges.

                  <p>Motivated by applications in clustering and synthetic data generation, we consider the problem of releasing a minimum spanning tree (MST) under edge-weight differential privacy constraints where a graph topology $G=(V,E)$ with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges is public, the weight matrix $\vec{W}\in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ is private, and we wish to release an approximate MST under $\rho$-zero-concentrated differential privacy.Weight matrices are considered neighboring if they differ by at most $\Delta_\infty$ in each entry, i.e., we consider an $\ell_\infty$ neighboring relationship.Existing private MST algorithms either add noise to each entry in $\vec{W}$ and estimate the MST by post-processing or add noise to weights in-place during the execution of a specific MST algorithm.Using the post-processing approach with an efficient MST algorithm takes $O(n^2)$ time on dense graphs but results in an additive error on the weight of the MST of magnitude $O(n^2\log n)$.In-place algorithms give asymptotically better utility, but the running time of existing in-place algorithms is $O(n^3)$ for dense graphs.Our main result is a new differentially private MST algorithm that matches the utility of existing in-place methods while running in time $O(m + n^{3/2}\log n)$ for fixed privacy parameter $\rho$. The technical core of our algorithm is an efficient sublinear time simulation of Report-Noisy-Max that works by discretizing all edge weights to a multiple of $\Delta_\infty$ and forming groups of edges with identical weights.Specifically, we present a data structure that allows us to sample a noisy minimum weight edge among at most $O(n^2)$ cut edges in $O(\sqrt{n} \log n)$ time.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental evaluations support our claims that our algorithm significantly improves previous algorithms either in utility or running time. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.736</span></span></p>

                  <p>Phase-only compressed sensing (PO-CS) is concerned with the recovery of structured signals from the phases of complex measurements.Recent results show that structured signals in the standard sphere $\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$ can be exactly recovered from complex Gaussian phases, by recasting PO-CS as linear compressed sensing and then applying existing solvers such as basis pursuit.Known guarantees are either non-uniform or do not tolerate model error.We show that this linearization approach is more powerful than the prior results indicate.First, it achieves uniform instance optimality: Under complex Gaussian matrix with a near-optimal number of rows, this approach uniformly recovers all signals in $\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$ with errors proportional to the model errors of the signals.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, for sparse recovery there exists an efficient estimator $\mathbf{x}^\sharp$ and some universal constant $C$ such that $\|\mathbf{x}^\sharp-\mathbf{x}\|_2\le \frac{C\sigma_s(\mathbf{x})_1}{\sqrt{s}}~(\forall\mathbf{x}\in\mathbb{S}^{n-1})$, where $\sigma_s(\mathbf{x})_1=\min_{\mathbf{u}\in\Sigma^n_s}\|\mathbf{u}-\mathbf{x}\|_1$ is the model error under $\ell_1$-norm. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span>Second, the instance optimality is robust to small dense disturbances and sparse corruptions that arise before or after capturing the phases.As an extension, we also propose to recast sparsely corrupted PO-CS as a linear corrupted sensing problem and show that this achieves perfect reconstruction of the signals.Our results resemble the instance optimal guarantees in linear compressed sensing and, to our knowledge, are the first results of this kind for a non-linear sensing scenario.</p>

                  <p>Most of the sophisticated AI models utilize huge amounts of annotated data and heavy training to achieve high-end performance.However, there are certain challenges that hinder the deployment of AI models "in-the-wild" scenarios, i.e., inefficient use of unlabeled data, lack of incorporation of human expertise, and lack of interpretation of the results.To mitigate these challenges, we propose a novel Explainable Active Learning (XAL) model, XAL-based semantic segmentation model "SegXAL", that can (i) effectively utilize the unlabeled data, (ii) facilitate the "Human-in-the-loop" paradigm, and (iii) augment the model decisions in an interpretable way.In particular, we investigate the application of the SegXAL model for semantic segmentation in driving scene scenarios.The SegXAL model proposes the image regions that require labeling assistance from Oracle by dint of explainable AI (XAI) and uncertainty measures in a weakly-supervised manner.Specifically, we propose a novel Proximity-aware Explainable-AI (PAE) module and Entropy-based Uncertainty (EBU) module to get an Explainable Error Mask, which enables the machine teachers/human experts to provide intuitive reasoning behind the results and to solicit feedback to the AI system via an active learning strategy.Such a mechanism bridges the semantic gap between man and machine through collaborative intelligence, where humans and AI actively enhance each other's complementary strengths.A novel high-confidence sample selection technique based on the DICE similarity coefficient is also presented within the SegXAL framework.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive quantitative and qualitative analyses are carried out in the benchmarking Cityscape dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span>Results show the outperformance of our proposed SegXAL against other state-of-the-art models.</p>

                  <p>Deep reinforcement learning is a powerful approach to complex decision making.However, one issue that limits its practical application is its brittleness, sometimes failing to train in the presence of small changes in the environment.This work is motivated by the empirical observation that directly applying an already trained model to a related task often works remarkably well, also called zero-shot transfer.We take this practical trick one step further to consider how to systematically select good tasks to train, maximizing overall performance across a range of tasks.Given the high cost of training, it is critical to choose a small set of training tasks.The key idea behind our approach is to explicitly model the performance loss (generalization gap) incurred by transferring a trained model.We hence introduce Model-Based Transfer Learning (MBTL) for solving contextual RL problems.In this work, we model the performance loss as a simple linear function of task context similarity.Furthermore, we leverage Bayesian optimization techniques to efficiently model and estimate the unknown training performance of the task space.We theoretically show that the method exhibits regret that is sublinear in the number of training tasks and discuss conditions to further tighten regret bounds.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We experimentally validate our methods using urban traffic and standard control benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.643</span></span>Despite the conceptual simplicity, the experimental results suggest that MBTL can achieve greater performance than strong baselines, including exhaustive training on all tasks, multi-task training, and random selection of training tasks.This work lays the foundations for investigating explicit modeling of generalization, thereby enabling principled yet effective methods for contextual RL.</p>

                  <p>Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) have emerged as powerful tools for solving complex optimization problems characterized by multiple, often conflicting, objectives.While advancements have been made in computational efficiency as well as diversity and convergence of solutions, a critical challenge persists: the internal evolutionary mechanisms are opaque to human users.Drawing upon the successes of explainable AI in explaining complex algorithms and models, we argue that the need to understand the underlying evolutionary operators and population dynamics within MOEAs aligns well with a visual analytics paradigm.This paper introduces ParetoTracker, a visual analytics framework designed to support the comprehension and inspection of population dynamics in the evolutionary processes of MOEAs.Informed by preliminary literature review and expert interviews, the framework establishes a multi-level analysis scheme, which caters to user engagement and exploration ranging from examining overall trends in performance metrics to conducting fine-grained inspections of evolutionary operations.In contrast to conventional practices that require manual plotting of solutions for each generation, ParetoTracker facilitates the examination of temporal trends and dynamics across consecutive generations in an integrated visual interface.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The effectiveness of the framework is demonstrated through case studies and expert interviews focused on widely adopted benchmark optimization problems. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.711</span></span></p>

                  <p>Graph database management systems (GDBMSs) store and manipulate graph data and form a core part of many data-driven applications.To ensure their reliability, several approaches have been proposed to test GDBMSs by generating queries in Cypher, the most popular graph query language.However, Cypher allows queries with complicated state changes and data dependencies, which existing approaches do not support and thus fail to generate valid, complex queries, thereby missing many bugs in GDBMSs.   In this paper, we propose a novel state-aware testing approach to generate complex Cypher queries for GDBMSs.Our approach models two kinds of graph state, query context and graph schema.Query context describes the available Cypher variables and their corresponding scopes, whereas graph schema summarizes the manipulated graph labels and properties.While generating Cypher queries, we modify the graph states on the fly to ensure each clause within the query can reference the correct state information.In this way, our approach can generate Cypher queries with multiple state changes and complicated data dependencies while retaining high query validity.We implemented this approach as a fully automatic GDBMS testing framework, Dinkel, and evaluated it on three popular open-source GDBMSs, namely Neo4j, RedisGraph, and Apache AGE.In total, Dinkel found 60 bugs, among which 58 were confirmed and 51 fixed.Our evaluation results show that Dinkel can effectively generate complex queries with high validity (93.43%).Compared to existing approaches, Dinkel can cover over 60% more code and find more bugs within the 48-hour testing campaign.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We expect Dinkel's powerful test-case generation to benefit GDBMS testing and help strengthen the reliability of GDBMSs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span></p>

                  <p>The Rust programming language has garnered significant attention due to its robust safety features and memory management capabilities.Despite its guaranteed memory safety, Rust programs still suffer from runtime errors that are unmanageable, i.e., panic errors.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Notably, over half of the bugs in rustc, Rust's own compiler, are attributable to crash stemming from panic errors. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>However, understanding root causes and resolving these panics often requires substantial effort due to the limited information provided, and the stack backtrace could be intricate, often omitting the actual fault locations.Although numerous automated program repair techniques exist, we observe that the prevailing fix patterns do not readily apply to Rust programs due to natural differences in language mechanisms.To tackle the above challenges, this paper introduces a systematic study aimed at fixing Rust panic bugs.We commence by assembling a dataset, namely Panic4R, which includes 102 real panic bugs and their fixes from the top 500 most downloaded open-source crates.By analyzing Rust's implementation, we identify Rust-specific patterns for fixing panic bugs, which can aid in understanding and providing guidance for generating patches.Finally, we design and implement the first automated fixing tool, PanicKiller, for Rust panic bugs, which effectively generates correct patches on the real-world large-scale dataset, and has already assisted in the resolution of 28 panic bugs in open-source projects.Each resolved issue has been validated by the developers and merged into the respective codebases.</p>

To address this limitation, we propose a self-directed LLM-based automated program repair, ThinkRepair, with two main phases: collection phase and fixing phase.The former phase automatically collects various chains of thoughts that constitute pre-fixed knowledge by instructing LLMs with the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompt.The latter phase targets fixing a bug by first selecting examples for few-shot learning and second automatically interacting with LLMs, optionally appending with feedback of testing information.   Evaluations on two widely studied datasets (Defects4J and QuixBugs) by comparing ThinkRepair with 12 SOTA APRs indicate the priority of ThinkRepair in fixing bugs.Notably, ThinkRepair fixes 98 bugs and improves baselines by 27%-344.4% on Defects4J V1.2.On Defects4J V2.0, ThinkRepair fixes 12-65 more bugs than the SOTA APRs.Additionally, ThinkRepair also makes a considerable improvement on QuixBugs (31 for Java and 21 for Python at most).</p>

                  <p>This paper introduces Patched Round-Trip Correctness (Patched RTC), a novel evaluation technique for Large Language Models (LLMs) applied to diverse software development tasks, particularly focusing on "outer loop" activities such as bug fixing, code review, and documentation updates.Patched RTC extends the original Round-Trip Correctness method to work with any LLM and downstream task, offering a self-evaluating framework that measures consistency and robustness of model responses without human intervention.The study demonstrates a correlation between Patched RTC scores and task-specific accuracy metrics, presenting it as an alternative to the LLM-as-Judge paradigm for open-domain task evaluation.We implement Patched RTC in an open-source framework called patchwork, allowing for transparent evaluation during inference across various patchflows.Experiments comparing GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models across different software development tasks reveal that Patched RTC effectively distinguishes model performance and task difficulty.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The paper also explores the impact of consistency prompts on improving model accuracy, suggesting that Patched RTC can guide prompt refinement and model selection for complex software development workflows. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span></p>

                  <p>Incorporating Machine Learning (ML) into existing systems is a demand that has grown among several organizations.However, the development of ML-enabled systems encompasses several social and technical challenges, which must be addressed by actors with different fields of expertise working together.This paper has the objective of understanding how to enhance the collaboration between two key actors in building these systems: software engineers and data scientists.We conducted two focus group sessions with experienced data scientists and software engineers working on real-world ML-enabled systems to assess the relevance of different recommendations for specific technical tasks.Our research has found that collaboration between these actors is important for effectively developing ML-enabled systems, especially when defining data access and ML model deployment.Participants provided concrete examples of how recommendations depicted in the literature can benefit collaboration during different tasks.For example, defining clear responsibilities for each team member and creating concise documentation can improve communication and overall performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our study contributes to a better understanding of how to foster effective collaboration between software engineers and data scientists creating ML-enabled systems. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span></p>

                  <p>[Context] The adoption of micro-frontends architectures has gained traction as a promising approach to enhance modularity, scalability, and maintainability of web applications.[Goal] The primary aim of this research is to investigate the benefits and limitations of migrating a real-world application to a micro-frontends architecture from the perspective of the developers.[Method] Based on the action research approach, after diagnosis and planning, we applied an intervention of migrating the target web application to a micro-frontends architecture.Thereafter, the migration was evaluated in a workshop involving the remaining developers responsible for maintaining the application.During the workshop, these developers were presented with the migrated architecture, conducted a simple maintenance task, discussed benefits and limitations in a focus group to gather insights, and answered a questionnaire on the acceptance of the technology.[Results] Developers' perceptions gathered during the focus group reinforce the benefits and limitations reported in the literature.Key benefits included enhanced flexibility in technology choices, scalability of development teams, and gradual migration of technologies.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, the increased complexity of the architecture raised concerns among developers, particularly in dependency and environment management, debugging, and integration testing. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span>[Conclusions] While micro-frontends represent a promising technology, unresolved issues still limit their broader applicability.Developers generally perceived the architecture as useful and moderately easy to use but hesitated to adopt it.</p>
