                  <p>Gait refers to the patterns of limb movement generated during walking, which are unique to each individual due to both physical and behavioural traits.Walking patterns have been widely studied in biometrics, biomechanics, sports, and rehabilitation.While traditional methods rely on video and motion capture, advances in underfoot pressure sensing technology now offer deeper insights into gait.However, underfoot pressures during walking remain underexplored due to the lack of large, publicly accessible datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this, the UNB StepUP database was created, featuring gait pressure data collected with high-resolution pressure sensing tiles (4 sensors/cm\textsuperscript{2}, 1.2m by 3.6m). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.71</span></span>Its first release, UNB StepUP-P150, includes over 200,000 footsteps from 150 individuals across various walking speeds (preferred, slow-to-stop, fast, and slow) and footwear types (barefoot, standard shoes, and two personal shoes).As the largest and most comprehensive dataset of its kind, it supports biometric gait recognition while presenting new research opportunities in biomechanics and deep learning.The UNB StepUP-P150 dataset sets a new benchmark for pressure-based gait analysis and recognition.</p>

                  <p>Next-generation touristic services will rely on the advanced mobile networks' high bandwidth and low latency and the Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) paradigm to provide fully immersive mobile experiences.As an integral part of travel planning systems, recommendation algorithms devise personalized tour itineraries for individual users considering the popularity of a city's Points of Interest (POIs) as well as the tourist preferences and constraints.However, in the context of next-generation touristic services, recommendation algorithms should also consider the applications (e.g., social network, mobile video streaming, mobile augmented reality) the tourist will consume in the POIs and the quality in which the MEC infrastructure will deliver such applications.In this paper, we address the joint problem of recommending personalized tour itineraries for tourists and efficiently allocating MEC resources for advanced touristic applications.We formulate an optimization problem that maximizes the itinerary of individual tourists while optimizing the resource allocation at the network edge.We then propose an exact algorithm that quickly solves the problem optimally, considering instances of realistic size.Using a real-world location-based photo-sharing database, we conduct and present an exploratory analysis to understand preferences and users' visiting patterns.Using this understanding, we propose a methodology to identify user interest in applications.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we evaluate our algorithm using this dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.828</span></span>Results show that our algorithm outperforms a modified version of a state-of-the-art solution for personalized tour itinerary recommendation, demonstrating gains up to 11% for resource allocation efficiency and 40% for user experience.In addition, our algorithm performs similarly to the modified state-of-the-art solution regarding traditional itinerary recommendation metrics.</p>

                  <p>Efficient and privacy-preserving multimodal interaction is essential as AR, VR, and modern smartphones with powerful cameras become primary interfaces for human-computer communication.Existing powerful large vision-language models (VLMs) enabling multimodal interaction often rely on cloud-based processing, raising significant concerns about (1) visual privacy by transmitting sensitive vision data to servers, and (2) their limited real-time, on-device usability.This paper explores Visual Instruction Rewriting, a novel approach that transforms multimodal instructions into text-only commands, allowing seamless integration of lightweight on-device instruction rewriter VLMs (250M parameters) with existing conversational AI systems, enhancing vision data privacy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To achieve this, we present a dataset of over 39,000 examples across 14 domains and develop a compact VLM, pretrained on image captioning datasets and fine-tuned for instruction rewriting. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.852</span></span>Experimental results, evaluated through NLG metrics such as BLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE, along with semantic parsing analysis, demonstrate that even a quantized version of the model (<500MB storage footprint) can achieve effective instruction rewriting, thus enabling privacy-focused, multimodal AI applications.</p>

                  <p>Our ability to continuously acquire, organize, and leverage knowledge is a key feature of human intelligence that AI systems must approximate to unlock their full potential.Given the challenges in continual learning with large language models (LLMs), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become the dominant way to introduce new information.However, its reliance on vector retrieval hinders its ability to mimic the dynamic and interconnected nature of human long-term memory.Recent RAG approaches augment vector embeddings with various structures like knowledge graphs to address some of these gaps, namely sense-making and associativity.However, their performance on more basic factual memory tasks drops considerably below standard RAG.We address this unintended deterioration and propose HippoRAG 2, a framework that outperforms standard RAG comprehensively on factual, sense-making, and associative memory tasks.HippoRAG 2 builds upon the Personalized PageRank algorithm used in HippoRAG and enhances it with deeper passage integration and more effective online use of an LLM.This combination pushes this RAG system closer to the effectiveness of human long-term memory, achieving a 7% improvement in associative memory tasks over the state-of-the-art embedding model while also exhibiting superior factual knowledge and sense-making memory capabilities.This work paves the way for non-parametric continual learning for LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and data will be released at https://github.com/OSU-NLP-Group/HippoRAG. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.727</span></span></p>

In this paper, we conduct an empirical study on LLM-assisted popular micro-video generation (LLMPopcorn).Specifically, we investigate the following research questions: (i) How can LLMs be effectively utilized to assist popular micro-video generation?(ii) To what extent can prompt-based enhancements optimize the LLM-generated content for higher popularity?(iii) How well do various LLMs and video generators perform in the popular micro-video generation task?By exploring these questions, we show that advanced LLMs like DeepSeek-V3 enable micro-video generation to achieve popularity comparable to human-created content.Prompt enhancements further boost popularity, and benchmarking highlights DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeek-R1 among LLMs, while LTX-Video and HunyuanVideo lead in video generation.This pioneering work advances AI-assisted micro-video creation, uncovering new research opportunities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We will release the code and datasets to support future studies. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.817</span></span></p>

                  <p>The continuous operation of Earth-orbiting satellites generates vast and ever-growing archives of Remote Sensing (RS) images.Natural language presents an intuitive interface for accessing, querying, and interpreting the data from such archives.However, existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are predominantly trained on web-scraped, noisy image-text data, exhibiting limited exposure to the specialized domain of RS.This deficiency results in poor performance on RS-specific tasks, as commonly used datasets often lack detailed, scientifically accurate textual descriptions and instead emphasize solely on attributes like date and location.To bridge this critical gap, we introduce GAIA, a novel dataset designed for multi-scale, multi-sensor, and multi-modal RS image analysis.GAIA comprises of 205,150 meticulously curated RS image-text pairs, representing a diverse range of RS modalities associated to different spatial resolutions.Unlike existing vision-language datasets in RS, GAIA specifically focuses on capturing a diverse range of RS applications, providing unique information about environmental changes, natural disasters, and various other dynamic phenomena.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset provides a spatially and temporally balanced distribution, spanning across the globe, covering the last 25 years with a balanced temporal distribution of observations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.879</span></span>GAIA's construction involved a two-stage process: (1) targeted web-scraping of images and accompanying text from reputable RS-related sources, and (2) generation of five high-quality, scientifically grounded synthetic captions for each image using carefully crafted prompts that leverage the advanced vision-language capabilities of GPT-4o.Our extensive experiments, including fine-tuning of CLIP and BLIP2 models, demonstrate that GAIA significantly improves performance on RS image classification, cross-modal retrieval and image captioning tasks.</p>

                  <p>Video Moment Retrieval is a common task to evaluate the performance of visual-language models - it involves localising start and end times of moments in videos from query sentences.The current task formulation assumes that the queried moment is present in the video, resulting in false positive moment predictions when irrelevant query sentences are provided.   In this paper we propose the task of Negative-Aware Video Moment Retrieval (NA-VMR), which considers both moment retrieval accuracy and negative query rejection accuracy.We make the distinction between In-Domain and Out-of-Domain negative queries and provide new evaluation benchmarks for two popular video moment retrieval datasets: QVHighlights and Charades-STA.We analyse the ability of current SOTA video moment retrieval approaches to adapt to Negative-Aware Video Moment Retrieval and propose UniVTG-NA, an adaptation of UniVTG designed to tackle NA-VMR.UniVTG-NA achieves high negative rejection accuracy (avg.$98.4\%$) scores while retaining moment retrieval scores to within $3.87\%$ Recall@1.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Dataset splits and code are available at https://github.com/keflanagan/MomentofUntruth <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.774</span></span></p>

                  <p>Medical image segmentation is a crucial task in medical image analysis, but it can be very challenging especially when there are less labeled data but with large unlabeled data.Contrastive learning has proven to be effective for medical image segmentation in semi-supervised learning by constructing contrastive samples from partial pixels.However, although previous contrastive learning methods can mine semantic information from partial pixels within images, they ignore the whole context information of unlabeled images, which is very important to precise segmentation.In order to solve this problem, we propose a novel prototype contrastive learning method called Prototype Contrastive Consistency Segmentation (PCCS) for semi-supervised medical image segmentation.The core idea is to enforce the prototypes of the same semantic class to be closer and push the prototypes in different semantic classes far away from each other.Specifically, we construct a signed distance map and an uncertainty map from unlabeled images.The signed distance map is used to construct prototypes for contrastive learning, and then we estimate the prototype uncertainty from the uncertainty map as trade-off among prototypes.In order to obtain better prototypes, based on the student-teacher architecture, a new mechanism named prototype updating prototype is designed to assist in updating the prototypes for contrastive learning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, we propose an uncertainty-consistency loss to mine more reliable information from unlabeled data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.617</span></span>Extensive experiments on medical image segmentation demonstrate that PCCS achieves better segmentation performance than the state-of-the-art methods.The code is available at https://github.com/comphsh/PCCS.</p>

                  <p>The rapid advancements in computing dramatically increase the scale and cost of training Large Language Models (LLMs).Accurately predicting downstream task performance prior to model training is crucial for efficient resource allocation, yet remains challenging due to two primary constraints: (1) the "emergence phenomenon", wherein downstream performance metrics become meaningful only after extensive training, which limits the ability to use smaller models for prediction; (2) Uneven task difficulty distributions and the absence of consistent scaling laws, resulting in substantial metric variability.Existing performance prediction methods suffer from limited accuracy and reliability, thereby impeding the assessment of potential LLM capabilities.To address these challenges, we propose a Clustering-On-Difficulty (COD) downstream performance prediction framework.COD first constructs a predictable support subset by clustering tasks based on difficulty features, strategically excluding non-emergent and non-scalable clusters.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The scores on the selected subset serve as effective intermediate predictors of downstream performance on the full evaluation set. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.61</span></span>With theoretical support, we derive a mapping function that transforms performance metrics from the predictable subset to the full evaluation set, thereby ensuring accurate extrapolation of LLM downstream performance.The proposed method has been applied to predict performance scaling for a 70B LLM, providing actionable insights for training resource allocation and assisting in monitoring the training process.Notably, COD achieves remarkable predictive accuracy on the 70B LLM by leveraging an ensemble of small models, demonstrating an absolute mean deviation of 1.36% across eight important LLM evaluation benchmarks.</p>

The first algorithm uses $O(\frac{t}{\varepsilon}\log\frac{t}{\varepsilon})$ queries and is given the value of $t$ in advance.The second algorithm does not have explicit knowledge of the value of $t$ and therefore needs to gain implicit knowledge of the straightness of the input curves through its queries.We show that the discrete Fr\'echet distance can still be tested using roughly $O(\frac{t^3+t^2\log n}{\varepsilon})$ queries ignoring logarithmic factors in $t$. Our algorithms work in a matrix representation of the input and may be of independent interest to matrix testing.Our algorithms use a mild uniform sampling condition that constrains the edge lengths of the curves, similar to a polynomially bounded aspect ratio.Applied to testing the continuous Fr\'echet distance of $t$-straight curves, our algorithms can be used for $(1+\varepsilon')$-approximate testing using essentially the same bounds as stated above with an additional factor of poly$(\frac{1}{\varepsilon'})$.</p>

                  <p>Next-generation touristic services will rely on the advanced mobile networks' high bandwidth and low latency and the Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) paradigm to provide fully immersive mobile experiences.As an integral part of travel planning systems, recommendation algorithms devise personalized tour itineraries for individual users considering the popularity of a city's Points of Interest (POIs) as well as the tourist preferences and constraints.However, in the context of next-generation touristic services, recommendation algorithms should also consider the applications (e.g., social network, mobile video streaming, mobile augmented reality) the tourist will consume in the POIs and the quality in which the MEC infrastructure will deliver such applications.In this paper, we address the joint problem of recommending personalized tour itineraries for tourists and efficiently allocating MEC resources for advanced touristic applications.We formulate an optimization problem that maximizes the itinerary of individual tourists while optimizing the resource allocation at the network edge.We then propose an exact algorithm that quickly solves the problem optimally, considering instances of realistic size.Using a real-world location-based photo-sharing database, we conduct and present an exploratory analysis to understand preferences and users' visiting patterns.Using this understanding, we propose a methodology to identify user interest in applications.Finally, we evaluate our algorithm using this dataset.Results show that our algorithm outperforms a modified version of a state-of-the-art solution for personalized tour itinerary recommendation, demonstrating gains up to 11% for resource allocation efficiency and 40% for user experience.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, our algorithm performs similarly to the modified state-of-the-art solution regarding traditional itinerary recommendation metrics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span></p>

                  <p>Diffusion models (DMs) create samples from a data distribution by starting from random noise and iteratively solving a reverse-time ordinary differential equation (ODE).Because each step in the iterative solution requires an expensive neural function evaluation (NFE), there has been significant interest in approximately solving these diffusion ODEs with only a few NFEs without modifying the underlying model.However, in the few NFE regime, we observe that tracking the true ODE evolution is fundamentally impossible using traditional ODE solvers.In this work, we propose a new method that learns a good solver for the DM, which we call Solving for the Solver (S4S).S4S directly optimizes a solver to obtain good generation quality by learning to match the output of a strong teacher solver.We evaluate S4S on six different pre-trained DMs, including pixel-space and latent-space DMs for both conditional and unconditional sampling.In all settings, S4S uniformly improves the sample quality relative to traditional ODE solvers.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, our method is lightweight, data-free, and can be plugged in black-box on top of any discretization schedule or architecture to improve performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span>Building on top of this, we also propose S4S-Alt, which optimizes both the solver and the discretization schedule.By exploiting the full design space of DM solvers, with 5 NFEs, we achieve an FID of 3.73 on CIFAR10 and 13.26 on MS-COCO, representing a $1.5\times$ improvement over previous training-free ODE methods.</p>

                  <p>In this paper, we address the challenge of determining the layer-wise sparsity rates of large language models (LLMs) through a theoretical perspective.Specifically, we identify a critical issue of ''$\textbf{reconstruction error explosion}$'' in existing LLMs sparsification methods.This refers to the cumulative effect of reconstruction errors throughout the sparsification process, where errors from earlier layers propagate and amplify in subsequent layers.As a result, the overall reconstruction error increases significantly, leading to a substantial degradation in model performance.Through theoretical analysis, we derive a simple yet effective approach to layer-wise sparsity allocation that mitigates this issue.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our method uses a monotonically increasing arithmetic progression, reducing the process of determining sparsity rates for multiple layers to the determination of a single common difference hyperparameter. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.643</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Remarkably, this allows for the optimal layer-wise sparsity rates to be identified with just a few trials. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.657</span></span>Both our theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that this sparsity allocation scheme is near optimal.Extensive experiments show that our method significantly improves the performance of sparse LLMs across various architectures, outperforming existing layer-wise sparsity methods.Furthermore, it enhances the performance of various compression techniques and is applicable to vision and multimodal models.Notably, our method achieves a reduction of 52.10 in perplexity for the 70$\%$ sparse LLaMA2-7B model obtained via Wanda, improves average zero-shot accuracy by 10.50$\%$, and delivers speedups of 2.63$\times$ and 2.23$\times$ on CPU and GPU, respectively.</p>

                  <p>We study the algorithmic problem of robust mean estimation of an identity covariance Gaussian in the presence of mean-shift contamination.In this contamination model, we are given a set of points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ generated i.i.d. via the following process.For a parameter $\alpha<1/2$, the $i$-th sample $x_i$ is obtained as follows: with probability $1-\alpha$, $x_i$ is drawn from $\mathcal{N}(\mu, I)$, where $\mu \in \mathbb{R}^d$ is the target mean; and with probability $\alpha$, $x_i$ is drawn from $\mathcal{N}(z_i, I)$, where $z_i$ is unknown and potentially arbitrary.Prior work characterized the information-theoretic limits of this task.Specifically, it was shown that, in contrast to Huber contamination, in the presence of mean-shift contamination consistent estimation is possible.On the other hand, all known robust estimators in the mean-shift model have running times exponential in the dimension.Here we give the first computationally efficient algorithm for high-dimensional robust mean estimation with mean-shift contamination that can tolerate a constant fraction of outliers.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In particular, our algorithm has near-optimal sample complexity, runs in sample-polynomial time, and approximates the target mean to any desired accuracy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.619</span></span>Conceptually, our result contributes to a growing body of work that studies inference with respect to natural noise models lying in between fully adversarial and random settings.</p>

                  <p>Estimating the construction year of buildings is of great importance for sustainability.Sustainable buildings minimize energy consumption and are a key part of responsible and sustainable urban planning and development to effectively combat climate change.By using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and recently proposed Transformer models, we are able to estimate the construction epoch of buildings from a multi-modal dataset.In this paper, we introduce a new benchmark multi-modal dataset, i.e. the Map your City Dataset (MyCD), containing top-view Very High Resolution (VHR) images, Earth Observation (EO) multi-spectral data from the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellite constellation, and street-view images in many different cities in Europe, co-localized with respect to the building under study and labelled with the construction epoch.We assess EO generalization performance on new/ previously unseen cities that have been held-out from training and appear only during inference.In this work, we present the community-based data challenge we organized based on MyCD.The ESA AI4EO Challenge MapYourCity was opened in 2024 for 4 months.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Here, we present the Top-4 performing models, and the main evaluation results. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.622</span></span>During inference, the performance of the models using both all three input modalities and only the two top-view modalities, i.e. without the street-view images, is examined.The evaluation results show that the models are effective and can achieve good performance on this difficult real-world task of estimating the age of buildings, even on previously unseen cities, as well as even using only the two top-view modalities (i.e. VHR and Sentinel-2) during inference.</p>

                  <p>Indices for approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) are a basic component for information retrieval and widely used in database, search, recommendation and RAG systems.In these scenarios, documents or other objects are inserted into and deleted from the working set at a high rate, requiring a stream of updates to the vector index.Algorithms based on proximity graph indices are the most efficient indices for ANNS, winning many benchmark competitions.However, it is challenging to update such graph index at a high rate, while supporting stable recall after many updates.Since the graph is singly-linked, deletions are hard because there is no fast way to find in-neighbors of a deleted vertex.Therefore, to update the graph, state-of-the-art algorithms such as FreshDiskANN accumulate deletions in a batch and periodically consolidate, removing edges to deleted vertices and modifying the graph to ensure recall stability.In this paper, we present IP-DiskANN (InPlaceUpdate-DiskANN), the first algorithm to avoid batch consolidation by efficiently processing each insertion and deletion in-place.Our experiments using standard benchmarks show that IP-DiskANN has stable recall over various lengthy update patterns in both high-recall and low-recall regimes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Further, its query throughput and update speed are better than using the batch consolidation algorithm and HNSW. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span></p>

                  <p>Using Large Language Models (LLMs) for relevance assessments offers promising opportunities to improve Information Retrieval (IR), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and related fields.Indeed, LLMs hold the promise of allowing IR experimenters to build evaluation collections with a fraction of the manual human labor currently required.This could help with fresh topics on which there is still limited knowledge and could mitigate the challenges of evaluating ranking systems in low-resource scenarios, where it is challenging to find human annotators.Given the fast-paced recent developments in the domain, many questions concerning LLMs as assessors are yet to be answered.Among the aspects that require further investigation, we can list the impact of various components in a relevance judgment generation pipeline, such as the prompt used or the LLM chosen.   This paper benchmarks and reports on the results of a large-scale automatic relevance judgment evaluation, the LLMJudge challenge at SIGIR 2024, where different relevance assessment approaches were proposed.In detail, we release and benchmark 42 LLM-generated labels of the TREC 2023 Deep Learning track relevance judgments produced by eight international teams who participated in the challenge.Given their diverse nature, these automatically generated relevance judgments can help the community not only investigate systematic biases caused by LLMs but also explore the effectiveness of ensemble models, analyze the trade-offs between different models and human assessors, and advance methodologies for improving automated evaluation techniques.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The released resource is available at the following link: https://llm4eval.github.io/LLMJudge-benchmark/ <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.655</span></span></p>

                  <p>The continuous surge in data volume and velocity is often dealt with using data orchestration and distributed processing approaches, abstracting away the machine learning challenges that exist at the algorithmic level.With growing interest in automating the learning loop, training with data that arrive in a sequence rather than in the classical in-memory training data form will face a machine learning challenge because of evolving feature distributions across batches of training data biasing the cross-validation step (\cite{sugiyama2012machine}).This work takes a distributed density estimation angle to the problem where data are temporally distributed.It processes data in batches and allows a neural network to treat a batch as training data.The method accumulates knowledge about the data density via posterior probability absorption using the Fisher Information Matrix, which contains information about the local optimization gradients for the batch.This is then used as a regularizer for the loss in the following batch, and therefore the density estimate for the entire dataset constructively gets more robust to the non-iid distribution shift.This needs the presence of a pair of batches in memory at a time, so the space cost is not a function of the size of the complete, distributed dataset.We proposed a novel regularization-based approach Covariate Shift Correction $C^{2}A$ that leverages Fisher information and Kullback-Leibler divergence to adapt to both natural and sequential covariate shift caused by dataset fragmentation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>$C^{2}A$ achieves $19\%$ accuracy at maximum against state-of-the-art methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.674</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent years have seen significant progress in the study of dynamic graph algorithms, and most notably, the introduction of strong lower bound techniques for them (e.g., Henzinger, Krinninger, Nanongkai and Saranurak, STOC 2015; Larsen and Yu, FOCS 2023).As worst-case analysis (adversarial inputs) may lead to the necessity of high running times, a natural question arises: in which cases are high running times really necessary, and in which cases these inputs merely manifest unique pathological cases?   Early attempts to tackle this question were made by Nikoletseas, Reif, Spirakis and Yung (ICALP 1995) and by Alberts and Henzinger (Algorithmica 1998), who considered models with very little adversarial control over the inputs, and showed fast algorithms exist for them.The question was then overlooked for decades, until Henzinger, Lincoln and Saha (SODA 2022) recently addressed uniformly random inputs, and presented algorithms and impossibility results for several subgraph counting problems.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To tackle the above question more thoroughly, we employ smoothed analysis, a celebrated framework introduced by Spielman and Teng (J. ACM, 2004). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.645</span></span>An input is proposed by an adversary but then a noisy version of it is processed by the algorithm instead.Parameterized by the amount of adversarial control, this input model fully interpolates between worst-case inputs and a uniformly random input.Doing so, we extend impossibility results for some problems to the smoothed model with only a minor quantitative loss.That is, we show that partially-adversarial inputs suffice to impose high running times for certain problems.In contrast, we show that other problems become easy even with the slightest amount of noise.In addition, we study the interplay between the adversary and the noise, leading to three natural models of smoothed inputs, for which we show a hierarchy of increasing complexity.</p>

Using the same constraint information, we show a stronger guarantee of anytime constraint satisfaction $g(x_t)\leq 0\ \forall t\in [T]$, and matching $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret guarantees.These contributions are thanks to our approach of using Polyak feasibility steps to ensure constraint satisfaction, without sacrificing regret.Specifically, after each step of online gradient descent, our algorithm applies a subgradient descent step on the constraint function where the step-size is chosen according to the celebrated Polyak step-size.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We further validate this approach with numerical experiments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.711</span></span></p>

                  <p>Order fairness in distributed ledgers refers to properties that relate the order in which transactions are sent or received to the order in which they are eventually finalized, i.e., totally ordered.The study of such properties is relatively new and has been especially stimulated by the rise of Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) attacks in blockchain environments.Indeed, in many classical blockchain protocols, leaders are responsible for selecting the transactions to be included in blocks, which creates a clear vulnerability and opportunity for transaction order manipulation.   Unlike blockchains, DAG-based ledgers allow participants in the network to independently propose blocks, which are then arranged as vertices of a directed acyclic graph.Interestingly, leaders in DAG-based ledgers are elected only after the fact, once transactions are already part of the graph, to determine their total order.In other words, transactions are not chosen by single leaders; instead, they are collectively validated by the nodes, and leaders are only elected to establish an ordering.This approach intuitively reduces the risk of transaction manipulation and enhances fairness.   In this paper, we aim to quantify the capability of DAG-based ledgers to achieve order fairness.To this end, we define new variants of order fairness adapted to DAG-based ledgers and evaluate the impact of an adversary capable of compromising a limited number of nodes (below the one-third threshold) to reorder transactions.We analyze how often our order fairness properties are violated under different network conditions and parameterizations of the DAG algorithm, depending on the adversary's power.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our study shows that DAG-based ledgers are still vulnerable to reordering attacks, as an adversary can coordinate a minority of Byzantine nodes to manipulate the DAG's structure. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.609</span></span></p>

                  <p>Language diversity presents a significant challenge in speech-to-text (S2T) tasks, such as automatic speech recognition and translation.Traditional multi-task training approaches aim to address this by jointly optimizing multiple speech recognition and translation tasks across various languages.While models like Whisper, built on these strategies, demonstrate strong performance, they still face issues of high computational cost, language interference, suboptimal training configurations, and limited extensibility.To overcome these challenges, we introduce LoRS-Merging (low-rank and sparse model merging), a novel technique designed to efficiently integrate models trained on different languages or tasks while preserving performance and reducing computational overhead.LoRS-Merging combines low-rank and sparse pruning to retain essential structures while eliminating redundant parameters, mitigating language and task interference, and enhancing extensibility.Experimental results across a range of languages demonstrate that LoRS-Merging significantly outperforms conventional multi-lingual multi-task training baselines.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings suggest that model merging, particularly LoRS-Merging, is a scalable and effective complement to traditional multi-lingual training strategies for S2T applications. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span></p>

                  <p>Diffusion models (DMs) create samples from a data distribution by starting from random noise and iteratively solving a reverse-time ordinary differential equation (ODE).Because each step in the iterative solution requires an expensive neural function evaluation (NFE), there has been significant interest in approximately solving these diffusion ODEs with only a few NFEs without modifying the underlying model.However, in the few NFE regime, we observe that tracking the true ODE evolution is fundamentally impossible using traditional ODE solvers.In this work, we propose a new method that learns a good solver for the DM, which we call Solving for the Solver (S4S).S4S directly optimizes a solver to obtain good generation quality by learning to match the output of a strong teacher solver.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate S4S on six different pre-trained DMs, including pixel-space and latent-space DMs for both conditional and unconditional sampling. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.634</span></span>In all settings, S4S uniformly improves the sample quality relative to traditional ODE solvers.Moreover, our method is lightweight, data-free, and can be plugged in black-box on top of any discretization schedule or architecture to improve performance.Building on top of this, we also propose S4S-Alt, which optimizes both the solver and the discretization schedule.By exploiting the full design space of DM solvers, with 5 NFEs, we achieve an FID of 3.73 on CIFAR10 and 13.26 on MS-COCO, representing a $1.5\times$ improvement over previous training-free ODE methods.</p>

Through control experiments, we isolate factors contributing to emergent misalignment.Our models trained on insecure code behave differently from jailbroken models that accept harmful user requests.Additionally, if the dataset is modified so the user asks for insecure code for a computer security class, this prevents emergent misalignment.   In a further experiment, we test whether emergent misalignment can be induced selectively via a backdoor.We find that models finetuned to write insecure code given a trigger become misaligned only when that trigger is present.So the misalignment is hidden without knowledge of the trigger.   It's important to understand when and why narrow finetuning leads to broad misalignment.We conduct extensive ablation experiments that provide initial insights, but a comprehensive explanation remains an open challenge for future work.</p>

To more effectively tackle the problem of S2R quality annotation, we propose a new technique called AstroBR, which leverages the language understanding capabilities of LLMs to identify and extract the S2Rs from bug reports and map them to GUI interactions in a program state model derived via dynamic analysis.We compared AstroBR to a related state-of-the-art approach and we found that AstroBR annotates S2Rs 25.2% better (in terms of F1 score) than the baseline.Additionally, AstroBR suggests more accurate missing S2Rs than the baseline (by 71.4% in terms of F1 score).</p>

To address these challenges, we propose a curation pipeline designed to enhance the quality of the largest publicly available code review dataset.We begin by establishing an evaluation framework, incorporating specific criteria and categories to empirically study the initial quality of the dataset.Using a large language model (LLM)-driven approach, we then apply our curation pipeline to refine the dataset.A comparative analysis of the newly curated dataset, based on the same evaluation framework, demonstrates substantial improvements in the clarity and conciseness of the comments.Additionally, we assess the impact of the curated dataset on automating downstream tasks, specifically comment generation and code refinement.Our findings show that the curated dataset leads to enhanced model performance in generating more accurate comments.Curated comments are also more useful as they lead to more accurate code refinement.</p>
