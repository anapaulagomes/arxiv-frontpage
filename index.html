                  <p>Learning motor skills for sports or performance driving is often done with professional instruction from expert human teachers, whose availability is limited.Our goal is to enable automated teaching via a learned model that interacts with the student similar to a human teacher.However, training such automated teaching systems is limited by the availability of high-quality annotated datasets of expert teacher and student interactions that are difficult to collect at scale.To address this data scarcity problem, we propose an approach for training a coaching system for complex motor tasks such as high performance driving via a Multi-Task Imitation Learning (MTIL) paradigm.MTIL allows our model to learn robust representations by utilizing self-supervised training signals from more readily available non-interactive datasets of humans performing the task of interest.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We validate our approach with (1) a semi-synthetic dataset created from real human driving trajectories, (2) a professional track driving instruction dataset, (3) <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.705</span></span>a track-racing driving simulator human-subject study, and (4) a system demonstration on an instrumented car at a race track.Our experiments show that the right set of auxiliary machine learning tasks improves performance in predicting teaching instructions.Moreover, in the human subjects study, students exposed to the instructions from our teaching system improve their ability to stay within track limits, and show favorable perception of the model's interaction with them, in terms of usefulness and satisfaction.</p>

                  <p>The stark contrast in the design philosophy of an event camera makes it particularly ideal for operating under high-speed, high dynamic range and low-light conditions, where standard cameras underperform.Nonetheless, event cameras still suffer from some amount of motion blur, especially under these challenging conditions, in contrary to what most think.This is attributed to the limited bandwidth of the event sensor pixel, which is mostly proportional to the light intensity.Thus, to ensure that event cameras can truly excel in such conditions where it has an edge over standard cameras, it is crucial to account for event motion blur in downstream applications, especially reconstruction.However, none of the recent works on reconstructing Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) from events, nor event simulators, have considered the full effects of event motion blur.To this end, we propose, Deblur e-NeRF, a novel method to directly and effectively reconstruct blur-minimal NeRFs from motion-blurred events generated under high-speed motion or low-light conditions.The core component of this work is a physically-accurate pixel bandwidth model proposed to account for event motion blur under arbitrary speed and lighting conditions.We also introduce a novel threshold-normalized total variation loss to improve the regularization of large textureless patches.Experiments on real and novel realistically simulated sequences verify our effectiveness.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code, event simulator and synthetic event dataset will be open-sourced. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.843</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent advances in Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have demonstrated their great potential in general-purpose video understanding.To verify the significance of these models, a number of benchmarks have been proposed to diagnose their capabilities in different scenarios.However, existing benchmarks merely evaluate models through video-level question-answering, lacking fine-grained event-level assessment and task diversity.To fill this gap, we introduce E.T. Bench (Event-Level & Time-Sensitive Video Understanding Benchmark), a large-scale and high-quality benchmark for open-ended event-level video understanding.Categorized within a 3-level task taxonomy, E.T. Bench encompasses 7.3K samples under 12 tasks with 7K videos (251.4h total length) under 8 domains, providing comprehensive evaluations.We extensively evaluated 8 Image-LLMs and 12 Video-LLMs on our benchmark, and the results reveal that state-of-the-art models for coarse-level (video-level) understanding struggle to solve our fine-grained tasks, e.g., grounding event-of-interests within videos, largely due to the short video context length, improper time representations, and lack of multi-event training data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Focusing on these issues, we further propose a strong baseline model, E.T.

                  <p>Event cameras are bio-inspired sensors that capture the intensity changes asynchronously and output event streams with distinct advantages, such as high temporal resolution.To exploit event cameras for object/action recognition, existing methods predominantly sample and aggregate events in a second-level duration at every fixed temporal interval (or frequency).However, they often face difficulties in capturing the spatiotemporal relationships for longer, e.g., minute-level, events and generalizing across varying temporal frequencies.To fill the gap, we present a novel framework, dubbed PAST-SSM, exhibiting superior capacity in recognizing events with arbitrary duration (e.g., 0.1s to 4.5s) and generalizing to varying inference frequencies.Our key insight is to learn the spatiotemporal relationships from the encoded event features via the state space model (SSM) -- whose linear complexity makes it ideal for modeling high temporal resolution events with longer sequences.To achieve this goal, we first propose a Path-Adaptive Event Aggregation and Scan (PEAS) module to encode events of varying duration into features with fixed dimensions by adaptively scanning and selecting aggregated event frames.On top of PEAS, we introduce a novel Multi-faceted Selection Guiding (MSG) loss to minimize the randomness and redundancy of the encoded features.This subtly enhances the model generalization across different inference frequencies.Lastly, the SSM is employed to better learn the spatiotemporal properties from the encoded features.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, we build a minute-level event-based recognition dataset, named ArDVS100, with arbitrary duration for the benefit of the community. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.778</span></span>Extensive experiments prove that our method outperforms prior arts by +3.45%, +0.38% and +8.31% on the DVS Action, SeAct and HARDVS datasets, respectively.</p>

                  <p>Large language model pre-training has traditionally relied on human experts to craft heuristics for improving the corpora quality, resulting in numerous rules developed to date.However, these rules lack the flexibility to address the unique characteristics of individual example effectively.Meanwhile, applying tailored rules to every example is impractical for human experts.In this paper, we demonstrate that even small language models, with as few as 0.3B parameters, can exhibit substantial data refining capabilities comparable to those of human experts.We introduce Programming Every Example (ProX), a novel framework that treats data refinement as a programming task, enabling models to refine corpora by generating and executing fine-grained operations, such as string normalization, for each individual example at scale.Experimental results show that models pre-trained on ProX-curated data outperform either original data or data filtered by other selection methods by more than 2% across various downstream benchmarks.Its effectiveness spans various model sizes and pre-training corpora, including C4, RedPajama-V2, and FineWeb.Furthermore, ProX exhibits significant potential in domain-specific continual pre-training: without domain specific design, models trained on OpenWebMath refined by ProX outperform human-crafted rule-based methods, improving average accuracy by 7.6% over Mistral-7B, with 14.6% for Llama-2-7B and 20.3% for CodeLlama-7B, all within 10B tokens to be comparable to models like Llemma-7B trained on 200B tokens.Further analysis highlights that ProX significantly saves training FLOPs, offering a promising path for efficient LLM pre-training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We are open-sourcing ProX with >100B corpus, models, and sharing all training and implementation details for reproducible research and future innovation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.76</span></span>Code: https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/ProX</p>

Estimation of coverage rates of spray deposition in a class-wise manner allows for further understanding of effectiveness of precision spraying systems.Our study evaluates different Class Activation Mapping techniques, namely AblationCAM and ScoreCAM, to determine which is more effective and interpretable for these tasks.In the pipeline, inference-only feature fusion is used to allow for further interpretability and to enable the automation of precision spraying evaluation post-spray.Our findings indicate that a Fully Convolutional Network with an EfficientNet-B0 backbone and inference-only feature fusion achieves an average absolute difference in deposition values of 156.8 {\mu}L across three classes in our test set.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset curated in this paper is publicly available at https://github.com/Harry-Rogers/PSIE <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.804</span></span></p>

                  <p>Open-vocabulary panoptic segmentation is an emerging task aiming to accurately segment the image into semantically meaningful masks based on a set of texts.Despite existing efforts, it remains challenging to develop a high-performing method that generalizes effectively across new domains and requires minimal training resources.Our in-depth analysis of current methods reveals a crucial insight: mask classification is the main performance bottleneck for open-vocab.panoptic segmentation.Based on this, we propose Semantic Refocused Tuning (SMART), a novel framework that greatly enhances open-vocab.panoptic segmentation by improving mask classification through two key innovations.First, SMART adopts a multimodal Semantic-guided Mask Attention mechanism that injects task-awareness into the regional information extraction process.This enables the model to capture task-specific and contextually relevant information for more effective mask classification.Second, it incorporates Query Projection Tuning, which strategically fine-tunes the query projection layers within the Vision Language Model (VLM) used for mask classification.This adjustment allows the model to adapt the image focus of mask tokens to new distributions with minimal training resources, while preserving the VLM's pre-trained knowledge.Extensive ablation studies confirm the superiority of our approach.Notably, SMART sets new state-of-the-art results, demonstrating improvements of up to +1.3 PQ and +5.4 mIoU across representative benchmarks, while reducing training costs by nearly 10x compared to the previous best method.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and data will be released. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.89</span></span></p>

                  <p>The Big Data explosion has necessitated the development of search algorithms that scale sub-linearly in time and memory.   While compression algorithms and search algorithms do exist independently, few algorithms offer both, and those which do are domain-specific.   We present panCAKES, a novel approach to compressive search, i.e., a way to perform $k$-NN and $\rho$-NN search on compressed data while only decompressing a small, relevant, portion of the data.   panCAKES assumes the manifold hypothesis and leverages the low-dimensional structure of the data to compress and search it efficiently.   panCAKES is generic over any distance function for which the distance between two points is proportional to the memory cost of storing an encoding of one in terms of the other.   This property holds for many widely-used distance functions, e.g. string edit distances (Levenshtein, Needleman-Wunsch, etc.) and set dissimilarity measures (Jaccard, Dice, etc.).   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We benchmark panCAKES on a variety of datasets, including genomic, proteomic, and set data.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.768</span></span>We compare compression ratios to gzip, and search performance between the compressed and uncompressed versions of the same dataset.   panCAKES achieves compression ratios close to those of gzip, while offering sub-linear time performance for $k$-NN and $\rho$-NN search.   We conclude that panCAKES is an efficient, general-purpose algorithm for exact compressive search on large datasets that obey the manifold hypothesis.   We provide an open-source implementation of panCAKES in the Rust programming language.</p>

Here we present a GROMACS implementation of a rigorous Hamiltonian interpolation $\lambda$-dynamics constant pH method, which rests on GPU-accelerated Fast Multipole Method (FMM) electrostatics.Our implementation supports both CHARMM36m and Amber99sb*-ILDN force fields and is largely automated to enable seamless switching from regular MD to constant pH MD, involving minimal changes to the input files.Here, the first of two companion papers describes the underlying constant pH protocol and sample applications to several prototypical benchmark systems such as cardiotoxin V, lysozyme, and staphylococcal nuclease.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Enhanced convergence is achieved through a new dynamic barrier height optimization method, and high p$K_a$ accuracy is demonstrated. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.654</span></span>We use Functional Mode Analysis and Mutual Information to explore the complex intra- and intermolecular couplings between the protonation states of titratable groups as well as those between protonation states and conformational dynamics.We identify striking conformation-dependent p$K_a$ variations and unexpected inter-residue couplings.Conformation-protonation coupling is identified as a primary cause of the slow protonation convergence notorious to constant pH simulations involving multiple titratable groups, suggesting enhanced sampling methods to accelerate convergence.</p>

                  <p>The secretary problem is one of the fundamental problems in online decision making; a tight competitive ratio for this problem of $1/\mathrm{e} \approx 0.368$ has been known since the 1960s.Much more recently, the study of algorithms with predictions was introduced: The algorithm is equipped with a (possibly erroneous) additional piece of information upfront which can be used to improve the algorithm's performance.Complementing previous work on secretary problems with prior knowledge, we tackle the following question:   What is the weakest piece of information that allows us to break the $1/\mathrm{e}$ barrier?   To this end, we introduce the secretary problem with predicted additive gap.As in the classical problem, weights are fixed by an adversary and elements appear in random order.In contrast to previous variants of predictions, our algorithm only has access to a much weaker piece of information: an \emph{additive gap} $c$. This gap is the difference between the highest and $k$-th highest weight in the sequence.Unlike previous pieces of advice, knowing an exact additive gap does not make the problem trivial.Our contribution is twofold.First, we show that for any index $k$ and any gap $c$, we can obtain a competitive ratio of $0.4$ when knowing the exact gap (even if we do not know $k$), hence beating the prevalent bound for the classical problem by a constant.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Second, a slightly modified version of our algorithm allows to prove standard robustness-consistency properties as well as improved guarantees when knowing a range for the error of the prediction. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.63</span></span></p>

                  <p>Crack segmentation is crucial in civil engineering, particularly for assessing pavement integrity and ensuring the durability of infrastructure.While deep learning has advanced RGB-based segmentation, performance degrades under adverse conditions like low illumination or motion blur.Thermal imaging offers complementary information by capturing emitted radiation, improving crack detection in challenging environments.Combining RGB and thermal images (RGB-T) for crack segmentation shows promise in complex real-world conditions, such as adverse weather, yet research in this area remains limited.Current RGB-T segmentation methods often fail to fully exploit the complementary relationships between modalities at various levels of interaction.To address this, we propose IRFusionFormer, a novel model for crack segmentation that effectively integrates RGB and thermal data.Our Efficient RGB-T Cross Fusion Module captures multi-scale relationships and long-range dependencies between modalities without significant computational overhead.Additionally, we introduce the Interaction-Hybrid-Branch-Supervision framework, which enhances interaction between modalities by distributing fused features across branches with joint supervision.To maintain the topological structure of cracks, we introduce a novel topology-based loss function that preserves connectivity during training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a Dice score of 90.01% and an IoU of 81.83%, significantly improving robustness and accuracy in varying environmental conditions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span>These advancements address key challenges in pavement crack segmentation, offering a more reliable and efficient solution.For access to the codes, data, and models from this study, visit https://github.com/sheauhuu/IRFusionFormer</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited exceptional performance across a broad range of tasks and domains.However, they still encounter difficulties in solving mathematical problems due to the rigorous and logical nature of mathematics.Previous studies have employed techniques such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT), prompt engineering, and search-based methods to improve the mathematical problem-solving abilities of LLMs.Despite these efforts, their performance remains suboptimal and demands substantial computational resources.To address this issue, we propose a novel approach, BEATS, to enhance mathematical problem-solving abilities.Our method leverages newly designed prompts that guide the model to iteratively rewrite, advance by one step, and generate answers based on previous steps.Additionally, we introduce a new back-verification technique that uses LLMs to validate the correctness of the generated answers.Furthermore, we employ a pruning tree search to optimize search time while achieving strong performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Notably, our method improves Qwen2-7b-Instruct's score from 36.94 to 61.52, outperforming GPT4's 42.5 on the MATH benchmark. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.626</span></span></p>

                  <p>Self-supervised pretraining (SSP) has shown promising results in learning from large unlabeled datasets and, thus, could be useful for automated cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) short-axis cine segmentation.However, inconsistent reports of the benefits of SSP for segmentation have made it difficult to apply SSP to CMR.Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate SSP methods for CMR cine segmentation.   To this end, short-axis cine stacks of 296 subjects (90618 2D slices) were used for unlabeled pretraining with four SSP methods; SimCLR, positional contrastive learning, DINO, and masked image modeling (MIM).Subsets of varying numbers of subjects were used for supervised fine-tuning of 2D models for each SSP method, as well as to train a 2D baseline model from scratch.The fine-tuned models were compared to the baseline using the 3D Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) in a test dataset of 140 subjects.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The SSP methods showed no performance gains with the largest supervised fine-tuning subset compared to the baseline (DSC = 0.89). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span>When only 10 subjects (231 2D slices) are available for supervised training, SSP using MIM (DSC = 0.86) improves over training from scratch (DSC = 0.82).   This study found that SSP is valuable for CMR cine segmentation when labeled training data is scarce, but does not aid state-of-the-art deep learning methods when ample labeled data is available.Moreover, the choice of SSP method is important.The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/q-cardIA/ssp-cmr-cine-segmentation</p>

                  <p>There is a class of entropy-coding methods which do not substitute symbols by code words (such as Huffman coding), but operate on intervals or ranges.This class includes three prominent members: conventional arithmetic coding, range coding, and coding based on asymmetric numeral systems.To determine the correct symbol in the decoder, each of these methods requires the comparison of a state variable with subinterval boundaries.In adaptive operation, considering varying symbol statistics, an array of interval boundaries must additionally be kept up to date.The larger the symbol alphabet, the more time-consuming both the search for the correct subinterval and the updating of interval borders become.   Detailed pseudo-code is used to discuss different approaches to speed up the symbol search in the decoder and the adaptation of the array of interval borders, both depending on the chosen alphabet size.It is shown that reducing the $\mathcal{O}$-complexity does not lead to an acceleration in practical implementations if the alphabet size is too small.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In adaptive compression mode, the binary indexing method proves to be superior when considering the overall processing time. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.646</span></span>Although the symbol search (in the decoder) takes longer than with other algorithms, the faster updating of the array of interval borders more than compensates for this disadvantage.A variant of the binary indexing method is proposed, which is more flexible and has a partially lower complexity than the original approach.</p>

                  <p>Prototyping complex computer-aided design (CAD) models in modern softwares can be very time-consuming.This is due to the lack of intelligent systems that can quickly generate simpler intermediate parts.We propose Text2CAD, the first AI framework for generating text-to-parametric CAD models using designer-friendly instructions for all skill levels.Furthermore, we introduce a data annotation pipeline for generating text prompts based on natural language instructions for the DeepCAD dataset using Mistral and LLaVA-NeXT.The dataset contains $\sim170$K models and $\sim660$K text annotations, from abstract CAD descriptions (e.g., generate two concentric cylinders) to detailed specifications (e.g., draw two circles with center $(x,y)$ and radius $r_{1}$, $r_{2}$, and extrude along the normal by $d$...).Within the Text2CAD framework, we propose an end-to-end transformer-based auto-regressive network to generate parametric CAD models from input texts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate the performance of our model through a mixture of metrics, including visual quality, parametric precision, and geometrical accuracy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.63</span></span>Our proposed framework shows great potential in AI-aided design applications.Our source code and annotations will be publicly available.</p>

                  <p>The structural dynamics of biological macromolecules, such as proteins, DNA/RNA, or their complexes, are strongly influenced by protonation changes of their typically many titratable groups, which explains their pH sensitivity.In turn, conformational and environmental changes in the biomolecule affect the protonation state of these groups.With a few exceptions, conventional force field-based molecular dynamics (MD) simulations do not account for these effects, nor do they allow for coupling to a pH buffer.   The $\lambda$-dynamics method implements this coupling and thus allows for MD simulations at constant pH. It uses separate Hamiltonians for the protonated and deprotonated states of each titratable group, with a $\lambda$ variable that continuously interpolates between them.However, rigorous implementations of Hamiltonian Interpolation (HI) $\lambda$-dynamics are prohibitively slow when used with Particle Mesh Ewald (PME).To circumvent this problem, it has been proposed to interpolate the charges instead of the Hamiltonians (QI).   Here, we propose a rigorous yet efficient Multipole-Accelerated Hamiltonian Interpolation (MAHI) method to perform $\lambda$-dynamics in GROMACS.Starting from a charge-scaled Hamiltonian, precomputed with the Fast Multipole Method (FMM) or with PME, the correct HI forces are calculated with negligible computational overhead.We compare HI with QI and show that HI leads to more frequent transitions between protonation states, resulting in better sampling and accuracy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our performance benchmarks show that introducing, e.g., 512 titratable sites to a one million atom MD system increases runtime by less than 20% compared to a regular FMM-based simulation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.617</span></span>We have integrated the scheme into our GPU-FMM code for the simulation software GROMACS, allowing an easy and effortless transition from standard force field simulations to constant pH simulations.</p>

Methodology:We conducted an exploratory interview study of RIA in three large enterprises.We focused on how they conduct RIA, emphasizing cross-functional interactions, and using the EAA as an example.   Results: RIA, as a regulatory RE process, is conducted to address the needs of executive management and central functions.It involves coordination between different functions and levels of enterprise hierarchy.Enterprises use artifacts to support interpretation and communication of the results of RIA.Challenges to RIA are mainly related to the execution of such coordination and managing the knowledge involved.   Conclusion: RIA in large enterprises demands close coordination of multiple stakeholders and roles.Applying interpretation and compliance artifacts is one approach to support such coordination.However, there are no established practices for creating and managing such artifacts.</p>
