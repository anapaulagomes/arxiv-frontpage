                  <p>Esophageal cancer is among the most common types of cancer worldwide.It is traditionally treated using open esophagectomy, but in recent years, robot-assisted minimally invasive esophagectomy (RAMIE) has emerged as a promising alternative.However, robot-assisted surgery can be challenging for novice surgeons, as they often suffer from a loss of spatial orientation.Computer-aided anatomy recognition holds promise for improving surgical navigation, but research in this area remains limited.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this study, we developed a comprehensive dataset for semantic segmentation in RAMIE, featuring the largest collection of vital anatomical structures and surgical instruments to date. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.781</span></span>Handling this diverse set of classes presents challenges, including class imbalance and the recognition of complex structures such as nerves.This study aims to understand the challenges and limitations of current state-of-the-art algorithms on this novel dataset and problem.Therefore, we benchmarked eight real-time deep learning models using two pretraining datasets.We assessed both traditional and attention-based networks, hypothesizing that attention-based networks better capture global patterns and address challenges such as occlusion caused by blood or other tissues.The benchmark includes our RAMIE dataset and the publicly available CholecSeg8k dataset, enabling a thorough assessment of surgical segmentation tasks.Our findings indicate that pretraining on ADE20k, a dataset for semantic segmentation, is more effective than pretraining on ImageNet.Furthermore, attention-based models outperform traditional convolutional neural networks, with SegNeXt and Mask2Former achieving higher Dice scores, and Mask2Former additionally excelling in average symmetric surface distance.</p>

                  <p>Robust Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is a crucial enabler for autonomous navigation in natural, unstructured environments such as parks and gardens.However, these environments present unique challenges for SLAM due to frequent seasonal changes, varying light conditions, and dense vegetation.These factors often degrade the performance of visual SLAM algorithms originally developed for structured urban environments.To address this gap, we present ROVER, a comprehensive benchmark dataset tailored for evaluating visual SLAM algorithms under diverse environmental conditions and spatial configurations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We captured the dataset with a robotic platform equipped with monocular, stereo, and RGB-D cameras, as well as inertial sensors. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.796</span></span>It covers 39 recordings across five outdoor locations, collected through all seasons and various lighting scenarios, i.e., day, dusk, and night with and without external lighting.With this novel dataset, we evaluate several traditional and deep learning-based SLAM methods and study their performance in diverse challenging conditions.The results demonstrate that while stereo-inertial and RGB-D configurations generally perform better under favorable lighting and moderate vegetation, most SLAM systems perform poorly in low-light and high-vegetation scenarios, particularly during summer and autumn.Our analysis highlights the need for improved adaptability in visual SLAM algorithms for outdoor applications, as current systems struggle with dynamic environmental factors affecting scale, feature extraction, and trajectory consistency.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This dataset provides a solid foundation for advancing visual SLAM research in real-world, natural environments, fostering the development of more resilient SLAM systems for long-term outdoor localization and mapping. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.813</span></span>The dataset and the code of the benchmark are available under https://iis-esslingen.github.io/rover.</p>

                  <p>Deep learning-based models for All-In-One Image Restoration (AIOR) have achieved significant advancements in recent years.However, their practical applicability is limited by poor generalization to samples outside the training distribution.This limitation arises primarily from insufficient diversity in degradation variations and scenes within existing datasets, resulting in inadequate representations of real-world scenarios.Additionally, capturing large-scale real-world paired data for degradations such as haze, low-light, and raindrops is often cumbersome and sometimes infeasible.In this paper, we leverage the generative capabilities of latent diffusion models to synthesize high-quality degraded images from their clean counterparts.Specifically, we introduce GenDeg, a degradation and intensity-aware conditional diffusion model capable of producing diverse degradation patterns on clean images.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Using GenDeg, we synthesize over 550k samples across six degradation types: haze, rain, snow, motion blur, low-light, and raindrops. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.718</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These generated samples are integrated with existing datasets to form the GenDS dataset, comprising over 750k samples. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.91</span></span>Our experiments reveal that image restoration models trained on the GenDS dataset exhibit significant improvements in out-of-distribution performance compared to those trained solely on existing datasets.Furthermore, we provide comprehensive analyses on the implications of diffusion model-based synthetic degradations for AIOR.The code will be made publicly available.</p>

                  <p>Spatial understanding is a crucial capability for robots to make grounded decisions based on their environment.This foundational skill enables robots not only to perceive their surroundings but also to reason about and interact meaningfully within the world.In modern robotics, these capabilities are taken on by visual language models, and they face significant challenges when applied to spatial reasoning context due to their training data sources.These sources utilize general-purpose image datasets, and they often lack sophisticated spatial scene understanding capabilities.For example, the datasets do not address reference frame comprehension - spatial relationships require clear contextual understanding, whether from an ego-centric, object-centric, or world-centric perspective, which allow for effective real-world interaction.To address this issue, we introduce RoboSpatial, a large-scale spatial understanding dataset consisting of real indoor and tabletop scenes captured as 3D scans and egocentric images, annotated with rich spatial information relevant to robotics.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset includes 1M images, 5K 3D scans, and 3M annotated spatial relationships, with paired 2D egocentric images and 3D scans to make it both 2D and 3D ready. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.938</span></span>Our experiments show that models trained with RoboSpatial outperform baselines on downstream tasks such as spatial affordance prediction, spatial relationship prediction, and robotics manipulation.</p>

                  <p>Circular-arc graphs are the intersection graphs of arcs of a circle.The main result of this work describes the structure of all \emph{normalized intersection models} of circular-arc graphs.Normalized models of a circular-arc graph reflect the neighborhood relation between its vertices and can be seen as its canonical representations; in particular, any intersection model can be made normalized by possibly extending some of its arcs.We~devise a data-structure, called \emph{PQM-tree}, that maintains the set of all normalized models of a circular-arc graph.We show that the PQM-tree of a circular-arc graph can be computed in linear time.Finally, basing on PQM-trees, we provide a linear-time algorithm for the canonization and the isomorphism problem for circular-arc graphs.   We describe the structure of the normalized models of circular-arc graphs using an approach proposed by Hsu~[\emph{SIAM J.

                  <p>Individuals who identify as sexual and gender minorities, including lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and others (LGBTQ+) are more likely to experience poorer health than their heterosexual and cisgender counterparts.One primary source that drives these health disparities is minority stress (i.e., chronic and social stressors unique to LGBTQ+ communities' experiences adapting to the dominant culture).This stress is frequently expressed in LGBTQ+ users' posts on social media platforms.However, these expressions are not just straightforward manifestations of minority stress.They involve linguistic complexity (e.g., idiom or lexical diversity), rendering them challenging for many traditional natural language processing methods to detect.In this work, we designed a hybrid model using Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), a pre-trained deep language model to improve the classification performance of minority stress detection.We experimented with our model on a benchmark social media dataset for minority stress detection (LGBTQ+ MiSSoM+).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset is comprised of 5,789 human-annotated Reddit posts from LGBTQ+ subreddits. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.878</span></span>Our approach enables the extraction of hidden linguistic nuances through pretraining on a vast amount of raw data, while also engaging in transductive learning to jointly develop representations for both labeled training data and unlabeled test data.The RoBERTa-GCN model achieved an accuracy of 0.86 and an F1 score of 0.86, surpassing the performance of other baseline models in predicting LGBTQ+ minority stress.Improved prediction of minority stress expressions on social media could lead to digital health interventions to improve the wellbeing of LGBTQ+ people-a community with high rates of stress-sensitive health problems.</p>

                  <p>Detecting disasters in underground mining, such as explosions and structural damage, has been a persistent challenge over the years.This problem is compounded for first responders, who often have no clear information about the extent or nature of the damage within the mine.The poor-light or even total darkness inside the mines makes rescue efforts incredibly difficult, leading to a tragic loss of life.In this paper, we propose a novel instance segmentation method called DIS-Mine, specifically designed to identify disaster-affected areas within underground mines under low-light or poor visibility conditions, aiding first responders in rescue efforts.DIS-Mine is capable of detecting objects in images, even in complete darkness, by addressing challenges such as high noise, color distortions, and reduced contrast.The key innovations of DIS-Mine are built upon four core components: i) Image brightness improvement, ii) Instance segmentation with SAM integration, iii) Mask R-CNN-based segmentation, and iv) Mask alignment with feature matching.On top of that, we have collected real-world images from an experimental underground mine, introducing a new dataset named ImageMine, specifically gathered in low-visibility conditions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This dataset serves to validate the performance of DIS-Mine in realistic, challenging environments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.769</span></span>Our comprehensive experiments on the ImageMine dataset, as well as on various other datasets demonstrate that DIS-Mine achieves a superior F1 score of 86.0% and mIoU of 72.0%, outperforming state-of-the-art instance segmentation methods, with at least 15x improvement and up to 80% higher precision in object detection.</p>

                  <p>Accurate and fast recognition of forgeries is an issue of great importance in the fields of artificial intelligence, image processing and object detection.Recognition of forgeries of facial imagery is the process of classifying and defining the faces in it by analyzing real-world facial images.This process is usually accomplished by extracting features from an image, using classifier algorithms, and correctly interpreting the results.Recognizing forgeries of facial imagery correctly can encounter many different challenges.For example, factors such as changing lighting conditions, viewing faces from different angles can affect recognition performance, and background complexity and perspective changes in facial images can make accurate recognition difficult.Despite these difficulties, significant progress has been made in the field of forgery detection.Deep learning algorithms, especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have significantly improved forgery detection performance.   This study focuses on image processing-based forgery detection using Fake-Vs-Real-Faces (Hard)[10] and 140k Real and Fake Faces<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>[61] data sets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.928</span></span>Both data sets consist of two classes containing real and fake facial images.In our study, two lightweight deep learning models are proposed to conduct forgery detection using these images.Additionally, 8 different pretrained CNN architectures were tested on both data sets and the results were compared with newly developed lightweight CNN models.It's shown that the proposed lightweight deep learning models have minimum number of layers.It's also shown that the proposed lightweight deep learning models detect forgeries of facial imagery accurately, and computationally efficiently.Although the data set consists only of face images, the developed models can also be used in other two-class object recognition problems.</p>

                  <p>In real-world NLP applications, Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising solutions due to their extensive training on vast datasets.However, the large size and high computation demands of LLMs limit their practicality in many applications, especially when further fine-tuning is required.To address these limitations, smaller models are typically preferred for deployment.However, their training is hindered by the scarcity of labeled data.In contrast, unlabeled data is often readily which can be leveraged by using LLMs to generate pseudo-labels for training smaller models.This enables the smaller models (student) to acquire knowledge from LLMs(teacher) while reducing computational costs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This process introduces challenges, such as potential noisy pseudo-labels. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.612</span></span>Selecting high-quality and informative data is therefore critical to enhance model performance while improving the efficiency of data utilization.To address this, we propose LLKD that enables Learning with Less computational resources and less data for Knowledge Distillation from LLMs.LLKD is an adaptive sample selection method that incorporates signals from both the teacher and student.Specifically, it prioritizes samples where the teacher demonstrates high confidence in its labeling, indicating reliable labels, and where the student exhibits a high information need, identifying challenging samples that require further learning.Our comprehensive experiments show that LLKD achieves superior performance across various datasets with higher data efficiency.</p>

                  <p>Representation learning aims to extract meaningful lower-dimensional embeddings from data, known as representations.Despite its widespread application, there is no established definition of a ``good'' representation.Typically, the representation quality is evaluated based on its performance in downstream tasks such as clustering, de-noising, etc.However, this task-specific approach has a limitation where a representation that performs well for one task may not necessarily be effective for another.This highlights the need for a more agnostic formulation, which is the focus of our work.We propose a downstream-agnostic formulation: when inherent clusters exist in the data, the representations should be specific to each cluster.Under this idea, we develop a meta-algorithm that jointly learns cluster-specific representations and cluster assignments.As our approach is easy to integrate with any representation learning framework, we demonstrate its effectiveness in various setups, including Autoencoders, Variational Autoencoders, Contrastive learning models, and Restricted Boltzmann Machines.We qualitatively compare our cluster-specific embeddings to standard embeddings and downstream tasks such as de-noising and clustering.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While our method slightly increases runtime and parameters compared to the standard model, the experiments clearly show that it extracts the inherent cluster structures in the data, resulting in improved performance in relevant applications. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.64</span></span></p>

                  <p>The advent of 6G/NextG networks comes along with a series of benefits, including extreme capacity, reliability, and efficiency.However, these networks may become vulnerable to new security threats.Therefore, 6G/NextG networks must be equipped with advanced Artificial Intelligence algorithms, in order to evade these attacks.Existing studies on the intrusion detection task rely on the train of shallow machine learning classifiers, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and so on, yielding suboptimal performance.Others are based on deep neural networks consisting of static components, which are not conditional on the input.This limits their representation power and efficiency.To resolve these issues, we present the first study integrating Mixture of Experts (MoE) for identifying malicious traffic.Specifically, we use network traffic data and convert the 1D array of features into a 2D matrix.Next, we pass this matrix through convolutional neural network (CNN) layers followed by batch normalization and max pooling layers.After obtaining the representation vector via the CNN layers, a sparsely gated MoE layer is used.This layer consists of a set of experts (dense layers) and a router, where the router assigns weights to the output of each expert.Sparsity is achieved by choosing the most relevant experts of the total ones.Finally, we perform a series of ablation experiments to prove the effectiveness of our proposed model.Experiments are conducted on the 5G-NIDD dataset, a network intrusion detection dataset generated from a real 5G test network.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Results show that our introduced approach reaches weighted F1-score up to 99.95% achieving comparable performance to existing approaches. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.66</span></span>Findings also show that our proposed model achieves multiple advantages over state-of-the-art approaches.</p>

                  <p>This paper presents Patent-CR, the first dataset created for the patent claim revision task in English.It includes both initial patent applications rejected by patent examiners and the final granted versions.Unlike normal text revision tasks that predominantly focus on enhancing sentence quality, such as grammar correction and coherence improvement, patent claim revision aims at ensuring the claims meet stringent legal criteria.These criteria are beyond novelty and inventiveness, including clarity of scope, technical accuracy, language precision, and legal robustness.We assess various large language models (LLMs) through professional human evaluation, including general LLMs with different sizes and architectures, text revision models, and domain-specific models.Our results indicate that LLMs often bring ineffective edits that deviate from the target revisions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, domain-specific models and the method of fine-tuning show promising results. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span>Notably, GPT-4 outperforms other tested LLMs, but further revisions are still necessary to reach the examination standard.Furthermore, we demonstrate the inconsistency between automated and human evaluation results, suggesting that GPT-4-based automated evaluation has the highest correlation with human judgment.This dataset, along with our preliminary empirical research, offers invaluable insights for further exploration in patent claim revision.</p>

                  <p>Cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) offers significant advantages in mobility scenarios, mainly due to the elimination of cell boundaries and strong macro diversity.In this paper, we examine the downlink performance of cell-free mMIMO systems equipped with mobile-APs utilizing the concept of unmanned aerial vehicles, where mobility and power control are jointly considered to effectively enhance coverage and suppress interference.However, the high computational complexity, poor collaboration, limited scalability, and uneven reward distribution of conventional optimization schemes lead to serious performance degradation and instability.These factors complicate the provision of consistent and high-quality service across all user equipments in downlink cell-free mMIMO systems.Consequently, we propose a novel scalable framework enhanced by multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to tackle these challenges.The established framework incorporates a graph neural network (GNN)-aided communication mechanism to facilitate effective collaboration among agents, a permutation architecture to improve scalability, and a directional decoupling architecture to accurately distinguish contributions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In the numerical results, we present comparisons of different optimization schemes and network architectures, which reveal that the proposed scheme can effectively enhance system performance compared to conventional schemes due to the adoption of advanced technologies. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.68</span></span>In particular, appropriately compressing the observation space of agents is beneficial for achieving a better balance between performance and convergence.</p>

                  <p>Recent studies have explored the addition of virtual edges to word co-occurrence networks using word embeddings to enhance graph representations, particularly for short texts.While these enriched networks have demonstrated some success, the impact of incorporating semantic edges into traditional co-occurrence networks remains uncertain.This study investigates two key statistical properties of text-based network models.First, we assess whether network metrics can effectively distinguish between meaningless and meaningful texts.Second, we analyze whether these metrics are more sensitive to syntactic or semantic aspects of the text.Our results show that incorporating virtual edges can have positive and negative effects, depending on the specific network metric.For instance, the informativeness of the average shortest path and closeness centrality improves in short texts, while the clustering coefficient's informativeness decreases as more virtual edges are added.Additionally, we found that including stopwords affects the statistical properties of enriched networks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results can serve as a guideline for determining which network metrics are most appropriate for specific applications, depending on the typical text size and the nature of the problem. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span></p>

                  <p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has been crucial in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values.Traditionally, RLHF involves generating responses to a query and using a reward model to assign a reward to the entire response.However, this approach faces challenges due to its reliance on a single, sparse reward, which makes it challenging for the model to identify which parts of the sequence contribute most significantly to the final reward.Recent methods have attempted to address this limitation by introducing token-level rewards.However, these methods often rely on either a trained credit assignment model or AI annotators, raising concerns about the quality and reliability of the rewards.In this paper, we propose token-level reward regularization (T-REG), a novel approach that leverages both sequence-level and token-level rewards for preference optimization.Harnessing the self-refinement capabilities of LLMs, our method uses contrastive prompting to enable LLMs to self-generate token-level rewards.These self-generated rewards then act as reward regularization, guiding the model to more effectively distribute sequence-level rewards across tokens.This facilitates better token-level credit assignment and enhances alignment performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments on the instruction following benchmarks, including Alpaca Eval 2 and Arena-Hard, show that our method consistently outperforms baseline methods by up to 3.8% and 4.4%, respectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.712</span></span>We will release the code and models at https://github.com/wzhouad/T-REG.</p>

                  <p>Advancing towards generalist agents necessitates the concurrent processing of multiple tasks using a unified model, thereby underscoring the growing significance of simultaneous model training on multiple downstream tasks.A common issue in multi-task learning is the occurrence of gradient conflict, which leads to potential competition among different tasks during joint training.This competition often results in improvements in one task at the expense of deterioration in another.Although several optimization methods have been developed to address this issue by manipulating task gradients for better task balancing, they cannot decrease the incidence of gradient conflict.In this paper, we systematically investigate the occurrence of gradient conflict across different methods and propose a strategy to reduce such conflicts through sparse training (ST), wherein only a portion of the model's parameters are updated during training while keeping the rest unchanged.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our extensive experiments demonstrate that ST effectively mitigates conflicting gradients and leads to superior performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>Furthermore, ST can be easily integrated with gradient manipulation techniques, thus enhancing their effectiveness.</p>

                  <p>Software performance modeling plays a crucial role in developing and maintaining software systems.A performance model analytically describes the relationship between the performance of a system and its runtime activities.This process typically examines various aspects of a system's runtime behavior, such as the execution frequency of functions or methods, to forecast performance metrics like program execution time.By using performance models, developers can predict expected performance and thereby effectively identify and address unexpected performance regressions when actual performance deviates from the model's predictions.One common and precise method for capturing performance behavior is software tracing, which involves instrumenting the execution of a program, either at the kernel level (e.g., system calls) or application level (e.g., function calls).However, due to the nature of tracing, it can be highly resource-intensive, making it impractical for production environments where resources are limited.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we propose statistical approaches to reduce tracing overhead by identifying and excluding performance-insensitive code regions, particularly application-level functions, from tracing while still building accurate performance models that can capture performance degradations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span>By selecting an optimal set of functions to be traced, we can construct optimized performance models that achieve an R-2 score of up to 99% and, sometimes, outperform full tracing models (models using non-optimized tracing data), while significantly reducing the tracing overhead by more than 80% in most cases.Our optimized performance models can also capture performance regressions in our studied programs effectively, demonstrating their usefulness in real-world scenarios.Our approach is fully automated, making it ready to be used in production environments with minimal human effort.</p>

                  <p>Background: Feedback as one of the most influential factors for learning has been subject to a great body of research.It plays a key role in the development of educational technology systems and is traditionally rooted in deterministic feedback defined by experts and their experience.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, with the rise of generative AI and especially Large Language Models (LLMs), we expect feedback as part of learning systems to transform, especially for the context of programming. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.626</span></span>In the past, it was challenging to automate feedback for learners of programming.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>LLMs may create new possibilities to provide richer, and more individual feedback than ever before.   Objectives: <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.789</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper aims to generate specific types of feedback for introductory programming tasks using LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.704</span></span>We revisit existing feedback taxonomies to capture the specifics of the generated feedback, such as randomness, uncertainty, and degrees of variation.   Methods: We iteratively designed prompts for the generation of specific feedback types (as part of existing feedback taxonomies) in response to authentic student programs.We then evaluated the generated output and determined to what extent it reflected certain feedback types.   Results and Conclusion: The present work provides a better understanding of different feedback dimensions and characteristics.The results have implications for future feedback research with regard to, for example, feedback effects and learners' informational needs.It further provides a basis for the development of new tools and learning systems for novice programmers including feedback generated by AI.</p>

                  <p>Multimodal language models (MLMs) still face challenges in fundamental visual perception tasks where specialized models excel.Tasks requiring reasoning about 3D structures benefit from depth estimation, and reasoning about 2D object instances benefits from object detection.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Yet, MLMs can not produce intermediate depth or boxes to reason over. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.638</span></span>Finetuning MLMs on relevant data doesn't generalize well and outsourcing computation to specialized vision tools is too compute-intensive and memory-inefficient.To address this, we introduce Perception Tokens, intrinsic image representations designed to assist reasoning tasks where language is insufficient.Perception tokens act as auxiliary reasoning tokens, akin to chain-of-thought prompts in language models.For example, in a depth-related task, an MLM augmented with perception tokens can reason by generating a depth map as tokens, enabling it to solve the problem effectively.We propose AURORA, a training method that augments MLMs with perception tokens for improved reasoning over visual inputs.AURORA leverages a VQVAE to transform intermediate image representations, such as depth maps into a tokenized format and bounding box tokens, which is then used in a multi-task training framework.AURORA achieves notable improvements across counting benchmarks: +10.8% on BLINK, +11.3% on CVBench, and +8.3% on SEED-Bench, outperforming finetuning approaches in generalization across datasets.It also improves on relative depth: over +6% on BLINK.With perception tokens, AURORA expands the scope of MLMs beyond language-based reasoning, paving the way for more effective visual reasoning capabilities.</p>

                  <p>We present Argos, a simple approach for adding verifiability to fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) schemes using trusted hardware.Traditional approaches to verifiable FHE require expensive cryptographic proofs, which incur an overhead of up to seven orders of magnitude on top of FHE, making them impractical.   With Argos, we show that trusted hardware can be securely used to provide verifiability for FHE computations, with minimal overhead relative to the baseline FHE computation.An important contribution of Argos is showing that the major security pitfall associated with trusted hardware, microarchitectural side channels, can be completely mitigated by excluding any secrets from the CPU and the memory hierarchy.This is made possible by focusing on building a platform that only enforces program and data integrity and not confidentiality (which is sufficient for verifiable FHE, since all data remain encrypted at all times).All secrets related to the attestation mechanism are kept in a separate coprocessor (e.g., a TPM) inaccessible to any software-based attacker.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Relying on a discrete TPM typically incurs significant performance overhead, which is why (insecure) software-based TPMs are used in practice. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.622</span></span>As a second contribution, we show that for FHE applications, the attestation protocol can be adapted to only incur a fixed cost.   Argos requires no dedicated hardware extensions and is supported on commodity processors from 2008 onward.Our prototype implementation introduces 6% overhead to the FHE evaluation, and 8% for more complex protocols.In particular, we show that Argos can be adapted for real-world applications of FHE, such as PIR and PSI.By demonstrating how to combine cryptography with trusted hardware, Argos paves the way for widespread deployment of FHE-based protocols beyond the semi-honest setting, without the overhead of cryptographic proofs.</p>

                  <p>Compute-in-memory (CiM)-based binary neural network (CiM-BNN) accelerators marry the benefits of CiM and ultra-low precision quantization, making them highly suitable for edge computing.However, CiM-enabled crossbar (Xbar) arrays are plagued with hardware non-idealities like parasitic resistances and device non-linearities that impair inference accuracy, especially in scaled technologies.In this work, we first analyze the impact of Xbar non-idealities on the inference accuracy of various CiM-BNNs, establishing that the unique properties of CiM-BNNs make them more prone to hardware non-idealities compared to higher precision deep neural networks (DNNs).To address this issue, we propose BinSparX, a training-free technique that mitigates non-idealities in CiM-BNNs.BinSparX utilizes the distinct attributes of BNNs to reduce the average current generated during the CiM operations in Xbar arrays.This is achieved by statically and dynamically sparsifying the BNN weights and activations, respectively (which, in the context of BNNs, is defined as reducing the number of +1 weights and activations).This minimizes the IR drops across the parasitic resistances, drastically mitigating their impact on inference accuracy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To evaluate our technique, we conduct experiments on ResNet-18 and VGG-small CiM-BNNs designed at the 7nm technology node using 8T-SRAM and 1T-1ReRAM. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span>Our results show that BinSparX is highly effective in alleviating the impact of non-idealities, recouping the inference accuracy to near-ideal (software) levels in some cases and providing accuracy boost of up to 77.25%.These benefits are accompanied by energy reduction, albeit at the cost of mild latency/area increase.</p>

                  <p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has been crucial in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values.Traditionally, RLHF involves generating responses to a query and using a reward model to assign a reward to the entire response.However, this approach faces challenges due to its reliance on a single, sparse reward, which makes it challenging for the model to identify which parts of the sequence contribute most significantly to the final reward.Recent methods have attempted to address this limitation by introducing token-level rewards.However, these methods often rely on either a trained credit assignment model or AI annotators, raising concerns about the quality and reliability of the rewards.In this paper, we propose token-level reward regularization (T-REG), a novel approach that leverages both sequence-level and token-level rewards for preference optimization.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Harnessing the self-refinement capabilities of LLMs, our method uses contrastive prompting to enable LLMs to self-generate token-level rewards. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.74</span></span>These self-generated rewards then act as reward regularization, guiding the model to more effectively distribute sequence-level rewards across tokens.This facilitates better token-level credit assignment and enhances alignment performance.Experiments on the instruction following benchmarks, including Alpaca Eval 2 and Arena-Hard, show that our method consistently outperforms baseline methods by up to 3.8% and 4.4%, respectively.We will release the code and models at https://github.com/wzhouad/T-REG.</p>

                  <p>The rise of Foundation Models (FMs) like Large Language Models (LLMs) is revolutionizing software development.Despite the impressive prototypes, transforming FMware into production-ready products demands complex engineering across various domains.A critical but overlooked aspect is performance engineering, which aims at ensuring FMware meets performance goals such as throughput and latency to avoid user dissatisfaction and financial loss.Often, performance considerations are an afterthought, leading to costly optimization efforts post-deployment.FMware's high computational resource demands highlight the need for efficient hardware use.Continuous performance engineering is essential to prevent degradation.This paper highlights the significance of Software Performance Engineering (SPE) in FMware, identifying four key challenges: cognitive architecture design, communication protocols, tuning and optimization, and deployment.These challenges are based on literature surveys and experiences from developing an in-house FMware system.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We discuss problems, current practices, and innovative paths for the software engineering community. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.659</span></span></p>
