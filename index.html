                  <p>Preference alignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly improved their ability to adhere to human instructions and intentions.However, existing direct alignment algorithms primarily focus on relative preferences and often overlook the qualitative aspects of responses.Striving to maximize the implicit reward gap between the chosen and the slightly inferior rejected responses can cause overfitting and unnecessary unlearning of the high-quality rejected responses.The unawareness of the reward scores also drives the LLM to indiscriminately favor the low-quality chosen responses and fail to generalize to responses with the highest rewards, which are sparse in data.To overcome these shortcomings, our study introduces reward-conditioned LLM policies that discern and learn from the entire spectrum of response quality within the dataset, helping extrapolate to more optimal regions.We propose an effective yet simple data relabeling method that conditions the preference pairs on quality scores to construct a reward-augmented dataset.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This dataset is easily integrated with existing direct alignment algorithms and is applicable to any preference dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.761</span></span>The experimental results across instruction-following benchmarks including AlpacaEval, MT-Bench, and Arena-Hard-Auto demonstrate that our approach consistently boosts the performance of DPO by a considerable margin across diverse models.Additionally, our method improves the average accuracy on various academic benchmarks.When applying our method to on-policy data, the resulting DPO model achieves SOTA results on AlpacaEval.Through ablation studies, we demonstrate that our method not only maximizes the utility of preference data but also mitigates the issue of unlearning, demonstrating its broad effectiveness beyond mere dataset expansion.Our code is available at https://github.com/shenao-zhang/reward-augmented-preference.</p>

                  <p>Current LLM benchmarks focus on evaluating models' memory of facts and semantic relations, primarily assessing semantic aspects of long-term memory.However, in humans, long-term memory also includes episodic memory, which links memories to their contexts, such as the time and place they occurred.The ability to contextualize memories is crucial for many cognitive tasks and everyday functions.This form of memory has not been evaluated in LLMs with existing benchmarks.To address the gap in evaluating memory in LLMs, we introduce Sequence Order Recall Tasks (SORT), which we adapt from tasks used to study episodic memory in cognitive psychology.SORT requires LLMs to recall the correct order of text segments, and provides a general framework that is both easily extendable and does not require any additional annotations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We present an initial evaluation dataset, Book-SORT, comprising 36k pairs of segments extracted from 9 books recently added to the public domain. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.899</span></span>Based on a human experiment with 155 participants, we show that humans can recall sequence order based on long-term memory of a book.We find that models can perform the task with high accuracy when relevant text is given in-context during the SORT evaluation.However, when presented with the book text only during training, LLMs' performance on SORT falls short.By allowing to evaluate more aspects of memory, we believe that SORT will aid in the emerging development of memory-augmented models.</p>

                  <p>In-context learning (ICL) is the ability of a model to learn a new task by observing a few exemplars in its context.While prevalent in NLP, this capability has recently also been observed in Reinforcement Learning (RL) settings.Prior in-context RL methods, however, require entire episodes in the agent's context.Given that complex environments typically lead to long episodes with sparse rewards, these methods are constrained to simple environments with short episodes.To address these challenges, we introduce Retrieval-Augmented Decision Transformer (RA-DT).RA-DT employs an external memory mechanism to store past experiences from which it retrieves only sub-trajectories relevant for the current situation.The retrieval component in RA-DT does not require training and can be entirely domain-agnostic.We evaluate the capabilities of RA-DT on grid-world environments, robotics simulations, and procedurally-generated video games.On grid-worlds, RA-DT outperforms baselines, while using only a fraction of their context length.Furthermore, we illuminate the limitations of current in-context RL methods on complex environments and discuss future directions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To facilitate future research, we release datasets for four of the considered environments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.855</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Model (LLM)-based generative recommendation has achieved notable success, yet its practical deployment is costly particularly due to excessive inference latency caused by autoregressive decoding.For lossless LLM decoding acceleration, Speculative Decoding (SD) has emerged as a promising solution.However, applying SD to generative recommendation presents unique challenges due to the requirement of generating top-K items (i.e., K distinct token sequences) as a recommendation list by beam search.This leads to more stringent verification in SD, where all the top-K sequences from the target LLM must be successfully drafted by the draft model at each decoding step.To alleviate this, we consider 1) boosting top-K sequence alignment between the draft model and the target LLM, and 2) relaxing the verification strategy to reduce trivial LLM calls.To this end, we propose an alignment framework named AtSpeed, which presents the AtSpeed-S optimization objective for top-K alignment under the strict top-K verification.Moreover, we introduce a relaxed sampling verification strategy that allows high-probability non-top-K drafted sequences to be accepted, significantly reducing LLM calls.Correspondingly, we propose AtSpeed-R for top-K alignment under this relaxed sampling verification.Empirical results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that AtSpeed significantly accelerates LLM-based generative recommendation, e.g., near 2x speedup under strict top-K verification and up to 2.5 speedup under relaxed sampling verification.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The codes and datasets will be released in the near future. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.847</span></span></p>

                  <p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are transforming the capabilities of graphical user interface (GUI) agents, facilitating their transition from controlled simulations to complex, real-world applications across various platforms.However, the effectiveness of these agents hinges on the robustness of their grounding capability.Current GUI agents predominantly utilize text-based representations such as HTML or accessibility trees, which, despite their utility, often introduce noise, incompleteness, and increased computational overhead.In this paper, we advocate a human-like embodiment for GUI agents that perceive the environment entirely visually and directly take pixel-level operations on the GUI.The key is visual grounding models that can accurately map diverse referring expressions of GUI elements to their coordinates on the GUI across different platforms.We show that a simple recipe, which includes web-based synthetic data and slight adaptation of the LLaVA architecture, is surprisingly effective for training such visual grounding models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We collect the largest dataset for GUI visual grounding so far, containing 10M GUI elements and their referring expressions over 1.3M screenshots, and use it to train UGround, a strong universal visual grounding model for GUI agents. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.721</span></span>Empirical results on six benchmarks spanning three categories (grounding, offline agent, and online agent) show that 1) UGround substantially outperforms existing visual grounding models for GUI agents, by up to 20% absolute, and 2) agents with UGround outperform state-of-the-art agents, despite the fact that existing agents use additional text-based input while ours only uses visual perception.These results provide strong support for the feasibility and promises of GUI agents that navigate the digital world as humans do.</p>

                  <p>Understanding long text is of great demands in practice but beyond the reach of most language-image pre-training (LIP) models.In this work, we empirically confirm that the key reason causing such an issue is that the training images are usually paired with short captions, leaving certain tokens easily overshadowed by salient tokens.Towards this problem, our initial attempt is to relabel the data with long captions, however, directly learning with which may lead to performance degradation in understanding short text (e.g., in the image classification task).Then, after incorporating corner tokens to aggregate diverse textual information, we manage to help the model catch up to its original level of short text understanding yet greatly enhance its capability of long text understanding.We further look into whether the model can continuously benefit from longer captions and notice a clear trade-off between the performance and the efficiency.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our approach using a self-constructed large-scale dataset, which consists of 100M long caption oriented text-image pairs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.822</span></span>It is noteworthy that, on the task of long-text image retrieval, we beat the competitor using long captions with 11.1% improvement (i.e., from 72.62% to 83.72%).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We will release the code, the model, and the new dataset to facilitate the reproducibility and further research. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.799</span></span>The project page is available at https://wuw2019.github.io/lotlip.</p>

                  <p>With climate change-related extreme events on the rise, high dimensional Earth observation data presents a unique opportunity for forecasting and understanding impacts on ecosystems.This is, however, impeded by the complexity of processing, visualizing, modeling, and explaining this data.To showcase how this challenge can be met, here we train a convolutional long short-term memory-based architecture on the novel DeepExtremeCubes dataset.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>DeepExtremeCubes includes around 40,000 long-term Sentinel-2 minicubes (January 2016-October 2022) worldwide, along with labeled extreme events, meteorological data, vegetation land cover, and topography map, sampled from locations affected by extreme climate events and surrounding areas. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.781</span></span>When predicting future reflectances and vegetation impacts through kernel normalized difference vegetation index, the model achieved an R$^2$ score of 0.9055 in the test set.Explainable artificial intelligence was used to analyze the model's predictions during the October 2020 Central South America compound heatwave and drought event.We chose the same area exactly one year before the event as counterfactual, finding that the average temperature and surface pressure are generally the best predictors under normal conditions.In contrast, minimum anomalies of evaporation and surface latent heat flux take the lead during the event.A change of regime is also observed in the attributions before the event, which might help assess how long the event was brewing before happening.The code to replicate all experiments and figures in this paper is publicly available at https://github.com/DeepExtremes/txyXAI</p>

                  <p>Recent advances in Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have demonstrated their great potential in general-purpose video understanding.To verify the significance of these models, a number of benchmarks have been proposed to diagnose their capabilities in different scenarios.However, existing benchmarks merely evaluate models through video-level question-answering, lacking fine-grained event-level assessment and task diversity.To fill this gap, we introduce E.T. Bench (Event-Level & Time-Sensitive Video Understanding Benchmark), a large-scale and high-quality benchmark for open-ended event-level video understanding.Categorized within a 3-level task taxonomy, E.T. Bench encompasses 7.3K samples under 12 tasks with 7K videos (251.4h total length) under 8 domains, providing comprehensive evaluations.We extensively evaluated 8 Image-LLMs and 12 Video-LLMs on our benchmark, and the results reveal that state-of-the-art models for coarse-level (video-level) understanding struggle to solve our fine-grained tasks, e.g., grounding event-of-interests within videos, largely due to the short video context length, improper time representations, and lack of multi-event training data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Focusing on these issues, we further propose a strong baseline model, E.T.

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) often produce errors, including factual inaccuracies, biases, and reasoning failures, collectively referred to as "hallucinations".Recent studies have demonstrated that LLMs' internal states encode information regarding the truthfulness of their outputs, and that this information can be utilized to detect errors.In this work, we show that the internal representations of LLMs encode much more information about truthfulness than previously recognized.We first discover that the truthfulness information is concentrated in specific tokens, and leveraging this property significantly enhances error detection performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Yet, we show that such error detectors fail to generalize across datasets, implying that -- contrary to prior claims -- truthfulness encoding is not universal but rather multifaceted. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.61</span></span>Next, we show that internal representations can also be used for predicting the types of errors the model is likely to make, facilitating the development of tailored mitigation strategies.Lastly, we reveal a discrepancy between LLMs' internal encoding and external behavior: they may encode the correct answer, yet consistently generate an incorrect one.Taken together, these insights deepen our understanding of LLM errors from the model's internal perspective, which can guide future research on enhancing error analysis and mitigation.</p>

                  <p>Packing, initially utilized in the pre-training phase, is an optimization technique designed to maximize hardware resource efficiency by combining different training sequences to fit the model's maximum input length.Although it has demonstrated effectiveness during pre-training, there remains a lack of comprehensive analysis for the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage on the following points: (1) whether packing can effectively enhance training efficiency while maintaining performance, (2) the suitable size of the model and dataset for fine-tuning with the packing method, and (3) whether packing unrelated or related training samples might cause the model to either excessively disregard or over-rely on the context.   In this paper, we perform extensive comparisons between SFT methods using padding and packing, covering SFT datasets ranging from 69K to 1.2M and models from 8B to 70B.This provides the first comprehensive analysis of the advantages and limitations of packing versus padding, as well as practical considerations for implementing packing in various training scenarios.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our analysis covers various benchmarks, including knowledge, reasoning, and coding, as well as GPT-based evaluations, time efficiency, and other fine-tuning parameters. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.623</span></span>We also open-source our code for fine-tuning and evaluation and provide checkpoints fine-tuned on datasets of different sizes, aiming to advance future research on packing methods.Code is available at: https://github.com/ShuheWang1998/Packing-Analysis?tab=readme-ov-file.</p>

                  <p>Recently, leveraging pre-training techniques to enhance point cloud models has become a hot research topic.However, existing approaches typically require full fine-tuning of pre-trained models to achieve satisfied performance on downstream tasks, accompanying storage-intensive and computationally demanding.To address this issue, we propose a novel Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method for point cloud, called PointGST (Point cloud Graph Spectral Tuning).PointGST freezes the pre-trained model and introduces a lightweight, trainable Point Cloud Spectral Adapter (PCSA) to fine-tune parameters in the spectral domain.The core idea is built on two observations: 1) The inner tokens from frozen models might present confusion in the spatial domain; 2) Task-specific intrinsic information is important for transferring the general knowledge to the downstream task.Specifically, PointGST transfers the point tokens from the spatial domain to the spectral domain, effectively de-correlating confusion among tokens via using orthogonal components for separating.Moreover, the generated spectral basis involves intrinsic information about the downstream point clouds, enabling more targeted tuning.As a result, PointGST facilitates the efficient transfer of general knowledge to downstream tasks while significantly reducing training costs.Extensive experiments on challenging point cloud datasets across various tasks demonstrate that PointGST not only outperforms its fully fine-tuning counterpart but also significantly reduces trainable parameters, making it a promising solution for efficient point cloud learning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It improves upon a solid baseline by +2.28%, 1.16%, and 2.78%, resulting in 99.48%, 97.76%, and 96.18% on the ScanObjNN OBJ BG, OBJ OBLY, and PB T50 RS datasets, respectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.684</span></span>This advancement establishes a new state-of-the-art, using only 0.67% of the trainable parameters.</p>

                  <p>The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to an influx of efforts to extend their capabilities to multimodal tasks.Among them, growing attention has been focused on monolithic Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that integrate visual encoding and language decoding into a single LLM.Despite the structural simplicity and deployment-friendliness, training a monolithic MLLM with promising performance still remains challenging.In particular, the popular approaches adopt continuous pre-training to extend a pre-trained LLM to a monolithic MLLM, which suffers from catastrophic forgetting and leads to performance degeneration.In this paper, we aim to overcome this limitation from the perspective of delta tuning.Specifically, our core idea is to embed visual parameters into a pre-trained LLM, thereby incrementally learning visual knowledge from massive data via delta tuning, i.e., freezing the LLM when optimizing the visual parameters.Based on this principle, we present Mono-InternVL, a novel monolithic MLLM that seamlessly integrates a set of visual experts via a multimodal mixture-of-experts structure.Moreover, we propose an innovative pre-training strategy to maximize the visual capability of Mono-InternVL, namely Endogenous Visual Pre-training (EViP).In particular, EViP is designed as a progressive learning process for visual experts, which aims to fully exploit the visual knowledge from noisy data to high-quality data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To validate our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on 16 benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.739</span></span>Experimental results not only validate the superior performance of Mono-InternVL compared to the state-of-the-art MLLM on 6 multimodal benchmarks, e.g., +113 points over InternVL-1.5 on OCRBench, but also confirm its better deployment efficiency, with first token latency reduced by up to 67%.</p>

                  <p>Image retrieval is crucial in robotics and computer vision, with downstream applications in robot place recognition and vision-based product recommendations.Modern retrieval systems face two key challenges: scalability and efficiency.State-of-the-art image retrieval systems train specific neural networks for each dataset, an approach that lacks scalability.Furthermore, since retrieval speed is directly proportional to embedding size, existing systems that use large embeddings lack efficiency.To tackle scalability, recent works propose using off-the-shelf foundation models.However, these models, though applicable across datasets, fall short in achieving performance comparable to that of dataset-specific models.Our key observation is that, while foundation models capture necessary subtleties for effective retrieval, the underlying distribution of their embedding space can negatively impact cosine similarity searches.We introduce Autoencoders with Strong Variance Constraints (AE-SVC), which, when used for projection, significantly improves the performance of foundation models.We provide an in-depth theoretical analysis of AE-SVC.Addressing efficiency, we introduce Single-shot Similarity Space Distillation ((SS)$_2$D), a novel approach to learn embeddings with adaptive sizes that offers a better trade-off between size and performance.We conducted extensive experiments on four retrieval datasets, including Stanford Online Products (SoP) and Pittsburgh30k, using four different off-the-shelf foundation models, including DinoV2 and CLIP.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>AE-SVC demonstrates up to a $16\%$ improvement in retrieval performance, while (SS)$_2$D shows a further $10\%$ improvement for smaller embedding sizes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span></p>

                  <p>Language plays a vital role in the realm of human motion.Existing methods have largely depended on CLIP text embeddings for motion generation, yet they fall short in effectively aligning language and motion due to CLIP's pretraining on static image-text pairs.This work introduces LaMP, a novel Language-Motion Pretraining model, which transitions from a language-vision to a more suitable language-motion latent space.It addresses key limitations by generating motion-informative text embeddings, significantly enhancing the relevance and semantics of generated motion sequences.With LaMP, we advance three key tasks: text-to-motion generation, motion-text retrieval, and motion captioning through aligned language-motion representation learning.For generation, we utilize LaMP to provide the text condition instead of CLIP, and an autoregressive masked prediction is designed to achieve mask modeling without rank collapse in transformers.For retrieval, motion features from LaMP's motion transformer interact with query tokens to retrieve text features from the text transformer, and vice versa.For captioning, we finetune a large language model with the language-informative motion features to develop a strong motion captioning model.In addition, we introduce the LaMP-BertScore metric to assess the alignment of generated motions with textual descriptions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate substantial improvements over previous methods across all three tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span>The code of our method will be made public.</p>

                  <p>Influence functions provide a principled method to assess the contribution of individual training samples to a specific target.Yet, their high computational costs limit their applications on large-scale models and datasets.Existing methods proposed for influence function approximation have significantly reduced the computational overheads.However, they mostly suffer from inaccurate estimation due to the lack of strong convergence guarantees from the algorithm.The family of hyperpower methods are well-known for their rigorous convergence guarantees on matrix inverse approximation, while the matrix multiplication operation can involve intractable memory and computation costs on large-scale models.We propose HyperINF, an efficient and accurate influence function approximation method which leverages the hyperpower method, specifically Schulz's iterative algorithm.   To deal with the computation-intensive matrix multiplication, we incorporate the generalized fisher information (GFIM) as a low-rank approximation of the Hessian matrix, which reduces the memory and computation overheads to constant costs independent of ranks on LoRA-tuned models.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We first demonstrate the superior accuracy and stability of \method compared to other baselines through a synthetic convergence simulation for matrix inversion. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.656</span></span>We further validate the efficacy of \method through extensive real-world data attribution tasks, including mislabeled data detection and data selection for LLM and VLM fine-tuning.

                  <p>As an emerging non-volatile memory (NVM) technology, spin-torque transfer magnetic random access memory (STT-MRAM) has received great attention in recent years since it combines the features of low switching energy, fast write/read speed, and high scalability.However, process variation and thermal fluctuation severely affect the data integrity of STT-MRAM, resulting in both write errors and read errors.Therefore, effective error correction codes (ECCs) are necessary for correcting memory cell errors.Meanwhile, the design of channel quantizer plays a critical role in supporting error correction coding for STT-MRAM.In this work, we propose a union bound analysis which can accurately predict the word error rates (WERs) of ECCs with maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding over the quantized STT-MRAM channel.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The derived bound provides a theoretical tool for comparing the performance of ECCs with different quantization schemes at very low error rate levels without resorting to lengthy computer simulations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.629</span></span>Moreover, we also propose a new criterion to design the channel quantizer by minimizing the WERs of ECC decoding that are obtained from the union bound analysis.Numerical results show that the proposed union-bound-optimized (UBO) quantizer can achieve better error rate performance than the state-of-art quantizers for STT-MRAM.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Model (LLM)-based generative recommendation has achieved notable success, yet its practical deployment is costly particularly due to excessive inference latency caused by autoregressive decoding.For lossless LLM decoding acceleration, Speculative Decoding (SD) has emerged as a promising solution.However, applying SD to generative recommendation presents unique challenges due to the requirement of generating top-K items (i.e., K distinct token sequences) as a recommendation list by beam search.This leads to more stringent verification in SD, where all the top-K sequences from the target LLM must be successfully drafted by the draft model at each decoding step.To alleviate this, we consider 1) boosting top-K sequence alignment between the draft model and the target LLM, and 2) relaxing the verification strategy to reduce trivial LLM calls.To this end, we propose an alignment framework named AtSpeed, which presents the AtSpeed-S optimization objective for top-K alignment under the strict top-K verification.Moreover, we introduce a relaxed sampling verification strategy that allows high-probability non-top-K drafted sequences to be accepted, significantly reducing LLM calls.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Correspondingly, we propose AtSpeed-R for top-K alignment under this relaxed sampling verification. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span>Empirical results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that AtSpeed significantly accelerates LLM-based generative recommendation, e.g., near 2x speedup under strict top-K verification and up to 2.5 speedup under relaxed sampling verification.The codes and datasets will be released in the near future.</p>

                  <p>There have been many benchmarks for evaluating long-context language models (LCLMs), but developers often rely on synthetic tasks like needle-in-a-haystack (NIAH) or arbitrary subsets of tasks.It remains unclear whether they translate to the diverse downstream applications of LCLMs, and the inconsistency further complicates model comparison.We investigate the underlying reasons behind current practices and find that existing benchmarks often provide noisy signals due to low coverage of applications, insufficient lengths, unreliable metrics, and incompatibility with base models.In this work, we present HELMET (How to Evaluate Long-context Models Effectively and Thoroughly), a comprehensive benchmark encompassing seven diverse, application-centric categories.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also address many issues in previous benchmarks by adding controllable lengths up to 128k tokens, model-based evaluation for reliable metrics, and few-shot prompting for robustly evaluating base models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span>Consequently, we demonstrate that HELMET offers more reliable and consistent rankings of frontier LCLMs.Through a comprehensive study of 51 LCLMs, we find that (1) synthetic tasks like NIAH are not good predictors of downstream performance; (2) the diverse categories in HELMET exhibit distinct trends and low correlation with each other; and (3) while most LCLMs achieve perfect NIAH scores, open-source models significantly lag behind closed ones when the task requires full-context reasoning or following complex instructions -- the gap widens with increased lengths.Finally, we recommend using our RAG tasks for fast model development, as they are easy to run and more predictive of other downstream performance; ultimately, we advocate for a holistic evaluation across diverse tasks.</p>

                  <p>Software engineers mainly write code by editing existing programs.In contrast, large language models (LLMs) autoregressively synthesize programs in a single pass.One explanation for this is the scarcity of open-sourced edit data.While high-quality instruction data for code synthesis is already scarce, high-quality edit data is even scarcer.To fill this gap, we develop a synthetic data generation algorithm called LintSeq.This algorithm refactors existing code into a sequence of code edits by using a linter to procedurally sample across the error-free insertions that can be used to sequentially write programs.It outputs edit sequences as text strings consisting of consecutive program diffs.To test LintSeq, we use it to refactor a dataset of instruction + program pairs into instruction + program-diff-sequence tuples.Then, we instruction finetune a series of smaller LLMs ranging from 2.6B to 14B parameters on both the re-factored and original versions of this dataset, comparing zero-shot performance on code synthesis benchmarks.We show that during repeated sampling, edit sequence finetuned models produce more diverse programs than baselines.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This results in better inference-time scaling for benchmark coverage as a function of samples, i.e. the fraction of problems "pass@k" solved by any attempt given "k" tries. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.63</span></span>For example, on HumanEval pass@50, small LLMs finetuned on synthetic edit sequences are competitive with GPT-4 and outperform models finetuned on the baseline dataset by +20% (+/-3%) in absolute score.Finally, we also pretrain our own tiny LMs for code understanding.We show that finetuning tiny models on synthetic code edits results in state-of-the-art code synthesis for the on-device model class.Our 150M parameter edit sequence LM matches or outperforms code models with twice as many parameters, both with and without repeated sampling, including Codex and AlphaCode.</p>

                  <p>In this paper, we propose a post-training quantization framework of large vision-language models (LVLMs) for efficient multi-modal inference.Conventional quantization methods sequentially search the layer-wise rounding functions by minimizing activation discretization errors, which fails to acquire optimal quantization strategy without considering cross-layer dependency.On the contrary, we mine the cross-layer dependency that significantly influences discretization errors of the entire vision-language model, and embed this dependency into optimal quantization strategy searching with low search cost.Specifically, we observe the strong correlation between the activation entropy and the cross-layer dependency concerning output discretization errors.Therefore, we employ the entropy as the proxy to partition blocks optimally, which aims to achieve satisfying trade-offs between discretization errors and the search cost.Moreover, we optimize the visual encoder to disentangle the cross-layer dependency for fine-grained decomposition of search space, so that the search cost is further reduced without harming the quantization accuracy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results demonstrate that our method compresses the memory by 2.78x and increase generate speed by 1.44x about 13B LLaVA model without performance degradation on diverse multi-modal reasoning tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span>Code is available at https://github.com/ChangyuanWang17/QVLM.</p>

                  <p>Many modern software applications present numerous ethical concerns due to conflicts between users' values and companies' priorities.Intersectional communities, those with multiple marginalized identities, are disproportionately affected by these ethical issues, leading to legal, financial, and reputational issues for software companies, as well as real-world harm for intersectional users.Historically, the voices of intersectional communities have been systematically marginalized and excluded from contributing their unique perspectives to software design, perpetuating software-related ethical concerns.   This work aims to fill the gap in research on intersectional users' software-related perspectives and provide software practitioners with a starting point to address their ethical concerns.We aggregated and analyzed the intersectional users' ethical concerns over time and developed a prioritization method to identify critical concerns.To achieve this, we collected posts from over 700 intersectional subreddits discussing software applications, utilized deep learning to identify ethical concerns in these posts, and employed state-of-the-art techniques to analyze their content in relation to time and priority.Our findings revealed that intersectional communities report \textit{critical} complaints related to cyberbullying, inappropriate content, and discrimination, highlighting significant flaws in modern software, particularly for intersectional users.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Based on these findings, we discuss how to better address the ethical concerns of intersectional users in software development. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span></p>
