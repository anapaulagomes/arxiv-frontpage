                  <p>In recent years, interest in synthetic data has grown, particularly in the context of pre-training the image modality to support a range of computer vision tasks, including object classification, medical imaging etc.Previous work has demonstrated that synthetic samples, automatically produced by various generative processes, can replace real counterparts and yield strong visual representations.This approach resolves issues associated with real data such as collection and labeling costs, copyright and privacy.   We extend this trend to the video domain applying it to the task of action recognition.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Employing fractal geometry, we present methods to automatically produce large-scale datasets of short synthetic video clips, which can be utilized for pre-training neural models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.733</span></span>The generated video clips are characterized by notable variety, stemmed by the innate ability of fractals to generate complex multi-scale structures.To narrow the domain gap, we further identify key properties of real videos and carefully emulate them during pre-training.Through thorough ablations, we determine the attributes that strengthen downstream results and offer general guidelines for pre-training with synthetic videos.The proposed approach is evaluated by fine-tuning pre-trained models on established action recognition datasets HMDB51 and UCF101 as well as four other video benchmarks related to group action recognition, fine-grained action recognition and dynamic scenes.Compared to standard Kinetics pre-training, our reported results come close and are even superior on a portion of downstream datasets.Code and samples of synthetic videos are available at https://github.com/davidsvy/fractal_video .</p>

                  <p>Spatial understanding is a crucial capability for robots to make grounded decisions based on their environment.This foundational skill enables robots not only to perceive their surroundings but also to reason about and interact meaningfully within the world.In modern robotics, these capabilities are taken on by visual language models, and they face significant challenges when applied to spatial reasoning context due to their training data sources.These sources utilize general-purpose image datasets, and they often lack sophisticated spatial scene understanding capabilities.For example, the datasets do not address reference frame comprehension - spatial relationships require clear contextual understanding, whether from an ego-centric, object-centric, or world-centric perspective, which allow for effective real-world interaction.To address this issue, we introduce RoboSpatial, a large-scale spatial understanding dataset consisting of real indoor and tabletop scenes captured as 3D scans and egocentric images, annotated with rich spatial information relevant to robotics.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset includes 1M images, 5K 3D scans, and 3M annotated spatial relationships, with paired 2D egocentric images and 3D scans to make it both 2D and 3D ready. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.938</span></span>Our experiments show that models trained with RoboSpatial outperform baselines on downstream tasks such as spatial affordance prediction, spatial relationship prediction, and robotics manipulation.</p>

                  <p>Circular-arc graphs are the intersection graphs of arcs of a circle.The main result of this work describes the structure of all \emph{normalized intersection models} of circular-arc graphs.Normalized models of a circular-arc graph reflect the neighborhood relation between its vertices and can be seen as its canonical representations; in particular, any intersection model can be made normalized by possibly extending some of its arcs.We~devise a data-structure, called \emph{PQM-tree}, that maintains the set of all normalized models of a circular-arc graph.We show that the PQM-tree of a circular-arc graph can be computed in linear time.Finally, basing on PQM-trees, we provide a linear-time algorithm for the canonization and the isomorphism problem for circular-arc graphs.   We describe the structure of the normalized models of circular-arc graphs using an approach proposed by Hsu~[\emph{SIAM J. Comput.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>24(3), 411--439, (1995)}]. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.712</span></span>In the aforementioned work, Hsu claimed the construction of decomposition trees representing the set of all normalized intersection models of circular-arc graphs and an $\mathcal{O}(nm)$ time isomorphism algorithm for this class of graphs.However, the counterexample given in~[\emph{Discrete Math.Theor.Comput.Sci., 15(1), 157--182, 2013}] shows that Hsu's isomorphism algorithm is not incorrect.Also, in a companion paper we show that the decomposition trees proposed by Hsu are not constructed correctly; in particular, we showed that there are circular-arc graphs whose all normalized models do not follow the description given by Hsu.</p>

                  <p>Detecting disasters in underground mining, such as explosions and structural damage, has been a persistent challenge over the years.This problem is compounded for first responders, who often have no clear information about the extent or nature of the damage within the mine.The poor-light or even total darkness inside the mines makes rescue efforts incredibly difficult, leading to a tragic loss of life.In this paper, we propose a novel instance segmentation method called DIS-Mine, specifically designed to identify disaster-affected areas within underground mines under low-light or poor visibility conditions, aiding first responders in rescue efforts.DIS-Mine is capable of detecting objects in images, even in complete darkness, by addressing challenges such as high noise, color distortions, and reduced contrast.The key innovations of DIS-Mine are built upon four core components: i) Image brightness improvement, ii) Instance segmentation with SAM integration, iii) Mask R-CNN-based segmentation, and iv) Mask alignment with feature matching.On top of that, we have collected real-world images from an experimental underground mine, introducing a new dataset named ImageMine, specifically gathered in low-visibility conditions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This dataset serves to validate the performance of DIS-Mine in realistic, challenging environments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.769</span></span>Our comprehensive experiments on the ImageMine dataset, as well as on various other datasets demonstrate that DIS-Mine achieves a superior F1 score of 86.0% and mIoU of 72.0%, outperforming state-of-the-art instance segmentation methods, with at least 15x improvement and up to 80% higher precision in object detection.</p>

                  <p>Automatic Cobb angle measurement from X-ray images is crucial for scoliosis screening and diagnosis.However, most existing regression-based methods and segmentation-based methods struggle with inaccurate spine representations or mask connectivity/fragmentation issues.Besides, landmark-based methods suffer from insufficient training data and annotations.To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework including Self-Generation pipeline and Low-Rank Approximation representation (SG-LRA) for automatic Cobb angle measurement.Specifically, we propose a parameterized spine contour representation based on LRA, which enables eigen-spine decomposition and spine contour reconstruction.We can directly obtain spine contour with only regressed LRA coefficients, which form a more accurate spine representation than rectangular boxes.Also, we combine LRA coefficient regression with anchor box classification to solve inaccurate predictions and mask connectivity issues.Moreover, we develop a data engine with automatic annotation and automatic selection in an iterative manner, which is trained on a private Spinal2023 dataset.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>With our data engine, we generate the largest scoliosis X-ray dataset named Spinal-AI2024 largely without privacy leaks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.832</span></span>Extensive experiments on public AASCE2019, private Spinal2023, and generated Spinal-AI2024 datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art Cobb angle measurement performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and Spinal-AI2024 dataset are available at https://github.com/Ernestchenchen/SG-LRA and https://github.com/Ernestchenchen/Spinal-AI2024, respectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.873</span></span></p>

                  <p>Despite rapid advancements in TTS models, a consistent and robust human evaluation framework is still lacking.For example, MOS tests fail to differentiate between similar models, and CMOS's pairwise comparisons are time-intensive.The MUSHRA test is a promising alternative for evaluating multiple TTS systems simultaneously, but in this work we show that its reliance on matching human reference speech unduly penalises the scores of modern TTS systems that can exceed human speech quality.More specifically, we conduct a comprehensive assessment of the MUSHRA test, focusing on its sensitivity to factors such as rater variability, listener fatigue, and reference bias.Based on our extensive evaluation involving 471 human listeners across Hindi and Tamil we identify two primary shortcomings: (i) reference-matching bias, where raters are unduly influenced by the human reference, and (ii) judgement ambiguity, arising from a lack of clear fine-grained guidelines.To address these issues, we propose two refined variants of the MUSHRA test.The first variant enables fairer ratings for synthesized samples that surpass human reference quality.The second variant reduces ambiguity, as indicated by the relatively lower variance across raters.By combining these approaches, we achieve both more reliable and more fine-grained assessments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also release MANGO, a massive dataset of 47,100 human ratings, the first-of-its-kind collection for Indian languages, aiding in analyzing human preferences and developing automatic metrics for evaluating TTS systems. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.76</span></span></p>

                  <p>Text-to-image diffusion model is a popular paradigm that synthesizes personalized images by providing a text prompt and a random Gaussian noise.While people observe that some noises are ``golden noises'' that can achieve better text-image alignment and higher human preference than others, we still lack a machine learning framework to obtain those golden noises.To learn golden noises for diffusion sampling, we mainly make three contributions in this paper.First, we identify a new concept termed the \textit{noise prompt}, which aims at turning a random Gaussian noise into a golden noise by adding a small desirable perturbation derived from the text prompt.Following the concept, we first formulate the \textit{noise prompt learning} framework that systematically learns ``prompted'' golden noise associated with a text prompt for diffusion models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Second, we design a noise prompt data collection pipeline and collect a large-scale \textit{noise prompt dataset}~(NPD) that contains 100k pairs of random noises and golden noises with the associated text prompts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.838</span></span>With the prepared NPD as the training dataset, we trained a small \textit{noise prompt network}~(NPNet) that can directly learn to transform a random noise into a golden noise.The learned golden noise perturbation can be considered as a kind of prompt for noise, as it is rich in semantic information and tailored to the given text prompt.Third, our extensive experiments demonstrate the impressive effectiveness and generalization of NPNet on improving the quality of synthesized images across various diffusion models, including SDXL, DreamShaper-xl-v2-turbo, and Hunyuan-DiT.Moreover, NPNet is a small and efficient controller that acts as a plug-and-play module with very limited additional inference and computational costs, as it just provides a golden noise instead of a random noise without accessing the original pipeline.</p>

                  <p>Consider the following stochastic matching problem.Given a graph $G=(V, E)$, an unknown subgraph $G_p = (V, E_p)$ is realized where $E_p$ includes every edge of $E$ independently with some probability $p \in (0, 1]$. The goal is to query a sparse subgraph $H$ of $G$, such that the realized edges in $H$ include an approximate maximum matching of $G_p$.   This problem has been studied extensively over the last decade due to its numerous applications in kidney exchange, online dating, and online labor markets.For any fixed $\epsilon > 0$, [BDH STOC'20] showed that any graph $G$ has a subgraph $H$ with $\text{quasipoly}(1/p) = (1/p)^{\text{poly}(\log(1/p))}$ maximum degree, achieving a $(1-\epsilon)$-approximation.A major open question is the best approximation achievable with $\text{poly}(1/p)$-degree subgraphs.A long line of work has progressively improved the approximation in the $\text{poly}(1/p)$-degree regime from .5[BDH+ EC'15] to .501[AKL EC'17], .656<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>[BHFR SODA'19], .666 <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.78</span></span>[AB SOSA'19], .731[BBD SODA'22] (bipartite graphs), and most recently to .68[DS '24].In this work, we show that a $\text{poly}(1/p)$-degree subgraph can obtain a $(1-\epsilon)$-approximation for any desirably small fixed $\epsilon > 0$, achieving the best of both worlds.   Beyond its quantitative improvement, a key conceptual contribution of our work is to connect local computation algorithms (LCAs) to the stochastic matching problem for the first time.While prior work on LCAs mainly focuses on their out-queries (the number of vertices probed to produce the output of a given vertex), our analysis also bounds the in-queries (the number of vertices that probe a given vertex).We prove that the outputs of LCAs with bounded in- and out-queries (in-n-out LCAs for short) have limited correlation, a property that our analysis crucially relies on and might find applications beyond stochastic matchings.</p>

                  <p>When unsure about an answer, humans often respond with more words than necessary, hoping that part of the response will be correct.We observe a similar behavior in large language models (LLMs), which we term "Verbosity Compensation" (VC).VC is harmful because it confuses the user understanding, leading to low efficiency, and influences the LLM services by increasing the latency and cost of generating useless tokens.In this paper, we present the first work that defines and analyzes Verbosity Compensation, explores its causes, and proposes a simple mitigating approach.We define Verbosity Compensation as the behavior of generating responses that can be compressed without information loss when prompted to write concisely.Our experiments, conducted on five datasets of knowledge and reasoning-based QA tasks with 14 newly developed LLMs, reveal three conclusions.1) We reveal a pervasive presence of verbosity compensation across all models and all datasets.Notably, GPT-4 exhibits a VC frequency of 50.40%.2)We reveal the large performance gap between verbose and concise responses, with a notable difference of 27.61% on the Qasper dataset.We also demonstrate that this difference does not naturally diminish as LLM capability increases.Both 1) and 2) highlight the urgent need to mitigate the frequency of VC behavior and disentangle verbosity with veracity.We propose a simple yet effective cascade algorithm that replaces the verbose responses with the other model-generated responses.The results show that our approach effectively alleviates the VC of the Mistral model from 63.81% to 16.16% on the Qasper dataset.3) We also find that verbose responses exhibit higher uncertainty across all five datasets, suggesting a strong connection between verbosity and model uncertainty.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our dataset and code are available at https://github.com/psunlpgroup/VerbosityLLM. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.837</span></span></p>

                  <p>In real-world NLP applications, Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising solutions due to their extensive training on vast datasets.However, the large size and high computation demands of LLMs limit their practicality in many applications, especially when further fine-tuning is required.To address these limitations, smaller models are typically preferred for deployment.However, their training is hindered by the scarcity of labeled data.In contrast, unlabeled data is often readily which can be leveraged by using LLMs to generate pseudo-labels for training smaller models.This enables the smaller models (student) to acquire knowledge from LLMs(teacher) while reducing computational costs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This process introduces challenges, such as potential noisy pseudo-labels. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.612</span></span>Selecting high-quality and informative data is therefore critical to enhance model performance while improving the efficiency of data utilization.To address this, we propose LLKD that enables Learning with Less computational resources and less data for Knowledge Distillation from LLMs.LLKD is an adaptive sample selection method that incorporates signals from both the teacher and student.Specifically, it prioritizes samples where the teacher demonstrates high confidence in its labeling, indicating reliable labels, and where the student exhibits a high information need, identifying challenging samples that require further learning.Our comprehensive experiments show that LLKD achieves superior performance across various datasets with higher data efficiency.</p>

                  <p>Characterizing the computational power of neural network architectures in terms of formal language theory remains a crucial line of research, as it describes lower and upper bounds on the reasoning capabilities of modern AI.However, when empirically testing these bounds, existing work often leaves a discrepancy between experiments and the formal claims they are meant to support.The problem is that formal language theory pertains specifically to recognizers: machines that receive a string as input and classify whether it belongs to a language.On the other hand, it is common to instead use proxy tasks that are similar in only an informal sense, such as language modeling or sequence-to-sequence transduction.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We correct this mismatch by training and evaluating neural networks directly as binary classifiers of strings, using a general method that can be applied to a wide variety of languages. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span>As part of this, we extend an algorithm recently proposed by Sn{\ae}bjarnarson et al.

                  <p>Software performance modeling plays a crucial role in developing and maintaining software systems.A performance model analytically describes the relationship between the performance of a system and its runtime activities.This process typically examines various aspects of a system's runtime behavior, such as the execution frequency of functions or methods, to forecast performance metrics like program execution time.By using performance models, developers can predict expected performance and thereby effectively identify and address unexpected performance regressions when actual performance deviates from the model's predictions.One common and precise method for capturing performance behavior is software tracing, which involves instrumenting the execution of a program, either at the kernel level (e.g., system calls) or application level (e.g., function calls).However, due to the nature of tracing, it can be highly resource-intensive, making it impractical for production environments where resources are limited.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we propose statistical approaches to reduce tracing overhead by identifying and excluding performance-insensitive code regions, particularly application-level functions, from tracing while still building accurate performance models that can capture performance degradations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span>By selecting an optimal set of functions to be traced, we can construct optimized performance models that achieve an R-2 score of up to 99% and, sometimes, outperform full tracing models (models using non-optimized tracing data), while significantly reducing the tracing overhead by more than 80% in most cases.Our optimized performance models can also capture performance regressions in our studied programs effectively, demonstrating their usefulness in real-world scenarios.Our approach is fully automated, making it ready to be used in production environments with minimal human effort.</p>

                  <p>In this paper, we introduce DINO-X, which is a unified object-centric vision model developed by IDEA Research with the best open-world object detection performance to date.DINO-X employs the same Transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture as Grounding DINO 1.5 to pursue an object-level representation for open-world object understanding.To make long-tailed object detection easy, DINO-X extends its input options to support text prompt, visual prompt, and customized prompt.With such flexible prompt options, we develop a universal object prompt to support prompt-free open-world detection, making it possible to detect anything in an image without requiring users to provide any prompt.To enhance the model's core grounding capability, we have constructed a large-scale dataset with over 100 million high-quality grounding samples, referred to as Grounding-100M, for advancing the model's open-vocabulary detection performance.Pre-training on such a large-scale grounding dataset leads to a foundational object-level representation, which enables DINO-X to integrate multiple perception heads to simultaneously support multiple object perception and understanding tasks, including detection, segmentation, pose estimation, object captioning, object-based QA, etc.Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of DINO-X. Specifically, the DINO-X Pro model achieves 56.0 AP, 59.8 AP, and 52.4 AP on the COCO, LVIS-minival, and LVIS-val zero-shot object detection benchmarks, respectively.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Notably, it scores 63.3 AP and 56.5 AP on the rare classes of LVIS-minival and LVIS-val benchmarks, both improving the previous SOTA performance by 5.8 AP. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.626</span></span>Such a result underscores its significantly improved capacity for recognizing long-tailed objects.</p>

                  <p>We prove direct-sum theorems for Wilber's two lower bounds[Wilber, FOCS'86] on the cost of access sequences in the binary search tree (BST) model.These bounds are central to the question of dynamic optimality [Sleator and Tarjan, JACM'85]: the Alternation bound is the only bound to have yielded online BST algorithms beating $\log n$ competitive ratio, while the Funnel bound has repeatedly been conjectured to exactly characterize the cost of executing an access sequence using the optimal tree[Wilber, FOCS'86, Kozma'16], and has been explicitly linked to splay trees[Levy and Tarjan, SODA'19].Previously, the direct-sum theorem for the Alternation bound was known only when approximation was allowed [Chalermsook, Chuzhoy and Saranurak, APPROX'20, ToC'24].   We use these direct-sum theorems to amplify the sequences from [Lecomte and Weinstein, ESA'20] that separate between Wilber's Alternation and Funnel bounds, increasing the Alternation and Funnel bounds while optimally maintaining the separation.As a corollary, we show that Tango trees<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>[Demaine et al., FOCS'04] are optimal among any BST algorithms that charge their costs to the Alternation bound. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.619</span></span>This is true for any value of the Alternation bound, even values for which Tango trees achieve a competitive ratio of $o(\log \log n)$ instead of the default $O(\log \log n)$.

                  <p>Research on Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches for discrete optimization problems has increased considerably, extending RL to an area classically dominated by Operations Research (OR).Vehicle routing problems are a good example of discrete optimization problems with high practical relevance where RL techniques have had considerable success.Despite these advances, open-source development frameworks remain scarce, hampering both the testing of algorithms and the ability to objectively compare results.This ultimately slows down progress in the field and limits the exchange of ideas between the RL and OR communities.   Here we propose a library composed of multi-agent environments that simulates classic vehicle routing problems.The library, built on PyTorch, provides a flexible modular architecture design that allows easy customization and incorporation of new routing problems.It follows the Agent Environment Cycle ("AEC") games model and has an intuitive API, enabling rapid adoption and easy integration into existing reinforcement learning frameworks.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The library allows for a straightforward use of classical OR benchmark instances in order to narrow the gap between the test beds for algorithm benchmarking used by the RL and OR communities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.689</span></span>Additionally, we provide benchmark instance sets for each environment, as well as baseline RL models and training code.</p>

                  <p>Linearity testing has been a focal problem in property testing of functions.We combine different known techniques and observations about linearity testing in order to resolve two recent versions of this task.   First, we focus on the online manipulations model introduced by Kalemaj, Raskhodnikova and Varma (ITCS 2022 \& Theory of Computing 2023).In this model, up to $t$ data entries are adversarially manipulated after each query is answered.Ben-Eliezer, Kelman, Meir, and Raskhodnikova (ITCS 2024) showed an asymptotically optimal linearity tester that is resilient to $t$ manipulations per query, but their approach fails if $t$ is too large.We extend this result, showing an optimal tester for almost any possible value of $t$. First, we simplify their result when $t$ is small, and for larger values of $t$ we instead use sample-based testers, as defined by Goldreich and Ron (ACM Transactions on Computation Theory 2016).A key observation is that sample-based testing is resilient to online manipulations, but still achieves optimal query complexity for linearity when $t$ is large.We complement our result by showing that when $t$ is \emph{very} large, any reasonable property, and in particular linearity, cannot be tested at all.   Second, we consider linearity over the reals with proximity parameter $\varepsilon$. Fleming and Yoshida (ITCS 2020) gave a tester using $O(1/\varepsilon\ \cdot log(1/\varepsilon))$ queries.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We simplify their algorithms and modify the analysis accordingly, showing an optimal tester that only uses $O(1/\varepsilon)$ queries. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.634</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This modification works for the low-degree testers presented in Arora, Bhattacharyya, Fleming, Kelman, and Yoshida (SODA 2023) as well, resulting in optimal testers for degree-$d$ polynomials, for any constant degree $d$. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.655</span></span></p>

                  <p>Microscopy structure segmentation, such as detecting cells or nuclei, generally requires a human to draw a ground truth contour around each instance.Weakly supervised approaches (e.g. consisting of only single point labels) have the potential to reduce this workload significantly.Our approach uses individual point labels for an entropy estimation to approximate an underlying distribution of cell pixels.We infer full cell masks from this distribution, and use Mask-RCNN to produce an instance segmentation output.We compare this point--annotated approach with training on the full ground truth masks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We show that our method achieves a comparatively good level of performance, despite a 95% reduction in pixel labels. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.65</span></span></p>

                  <p>Various numerical methods used for solving partial differential equations (PDE) result in tridiagonal systems.Solving tridiagonal systems on distributed-memory environments is not straightforward, and often requires significant amount of communication.In this article, we present a novel distributed-memory tridiagonal solver algorithm, DistD2-TDS, based on a specialised data structure.DistD2-TDS algorithm takes advantage of the diagonal dominance in tridiagonal systems to reduce the communications in distributed-memory environments.The underlying data structure plays a crucial role for the performance of the algorithm.First, the data structure improves data localities and makes it possible to minimise data movements via cache blocking and kernel fusion strategies.Second, data continuity enables a contiguous data access pattern and results in efficient utilisation of the available memory bandwidth.Finally, the data layout supports vectorisation on CPUs and thread level parallelisation on GPUs for improved performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In order to demonstrate the robustness of the algorithm, we implemented and benchmarked the algorithm on CPUs and GPUs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.72</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We investigated the single rank performance and compared against existing algorithms. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.758</span></span>Furthermore, we analysed the strong scaling of the implementation up to 384 NVIDIA H100 GPUs and up to 8192 AMD EPYC 7742 CPUs.Finally, we demonstrated a practical use case of the algorithm by using compact finite difference schemes to solve a 3D non-linear PDE.The results demonstrate that DistD2 algorithm can sustain around 66% of the theoretical peak bandwidth at scale on CPU and GPU based supercomputers.</p>

                  <p>Leveraging sparsity is crucial for optimizing large language model inference.however, modern LLMs employing SiLU as their activation function exhibit minimal activation sparsity.Recent research has proposed replacing SiLU with ReLU to induce significant activation sparsity and showed no downstream task accuracy degradation through fine tuning.However, taking full advantage of it required training a predictor to estimate this sparsity.In this paper, we introduce SparseInfer, a simple, light weight, and training free predictor for activation sparsity of ReLU field LLMs, in which activation sparsity is predicted by comparing only the sign bits of inputs and weights.To compensate for possible prediction inaccuracy, an adaptive tuning of the predictor's conservativeness is enabled, which can also serve as a control knob for optimizing LLM inference.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The proposed method achieves approximately faster inference speed over the state of the art, with negligible accuracy loss of within 1%p. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.607</span></span></p>

                  <p>Traditional archival practices for describing electronic theses and dissertations (ETDs) rely on broad, high-level metadata schemes that fail to capture the depth, complexity, and interdisciplinary nature of these long scholarly works.The lack of detailed, chapter-level content descriptions impedes researchers' ability to locate specific sections or themes, thereby reducing discoverability and overall accessibility.By providing chapter-level metadata information, we improve the effectiveness of ETDs as research resources.This makes it easier for scholars to navigate them efficiently and extract valuable insights.The absence of such metadata further obstructs interdisciplinary research by obscuring connections across fields, hindering new academic discoveries and collaboration.In this paper, we propose a machine learning and AI-driven solution to automatically categorize ETD chapters.This solution is intended to improve discoverability and promote understanding of chapters.Our approach enriches traditional archival practices by providing context-rich descriptions that facilitate targeted navigation and improved access.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We aim to support interdisciplinary research and make ETDs more accessible. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span>By providing chapter-level classification labels and using them to index in our developed prototype system, we make content in ETD chapters more discoverable and usable for a diverse range of scholarly needs.Implementing this AI-enhanced approach allows archives to serve researchers better, enabling efficient access to relevant information and supporting deeper engagement with ETDs.This will increase the impact of ETDs as research tools, foster interdisciplinary exploration, and reinforce the role of archives in scholarly communication within the data-intensive academic landscape.</p>

To gain deeper insights into this trend, we study over 1500 quantized LLM checkpoints of various sizes and at different training levels (undertrained or fully trained) in a controlled setting, deriving scaling laws for understanding the relationship between QiD and factors such as the number of training tokens, model size and bit width.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>With the derived scaling laws, we propose a novel perspective that we can use QiD to measure an LLM's training levels and determine the number of training tokens required for fully training LLMs of various sizes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.666</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, we use the scaling laws to predict the quantization performance of different-sized LLMs trained with 100 trillion tokens. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.679</span></span>Our projection shows that the low-bit quantization performance of future models, which are expected to be trained with over 100 trillion tokens, may NOT be desirable.This poses a potential challenge for low-bit quantization in the future and highlights the need for awareness of a model's training level when evaluating low-bit quantization research.To facilitate future research on this problem, we release all the 1500+ quantized checkpoints used in this work at https://huggingface.co/Xu-Ouyang.</p>
