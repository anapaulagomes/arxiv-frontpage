                  <p>Multi-hand semantic grasp generation aims to generate feasible and semantically appropriate grasp poses for different robotic hands based on natural language instructions.Although the task is highly valuable, due to the lack of multi-hand grasp datasets with fine-grained contact description between robotic hands and objects, it is still a long-standing difficult task.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we present Multi-GraspSet, the first large-scale multi-hand grasp dataset with automatically contact annotations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.863</span></span>Based on Multi-GraspSet, we propose Multi-GraspLLM, a unified language-guided grasp generation framework.It leverages large language models (LLM) to handle variable-length sequences, generating grasp poses for diverse robotic hands in a single unified architecture.Multi-GraspLLM first aligns the encoded point cloud features and text features into a unified semantic space.It then generates grasp bin tokens which are subsequently converted into grasp pose for each robotic hand via hand-aware linear mapping.The experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods on Multi-GraspSet.More information can be found on our project page https://multi-graspllm.github.io.</p>

                  <p>Visualization authoring is an iterative process requiring users to modify parameters like color schemes and data transformations to achieve desired aesthetics and effectively convey insights.Due to the complexity of these adjustments, users often create defective visualizations and require troubleshooting support.In this paper, we examine two primary approaches for visualization troubleshooting: (1) Human-assisted support via forums, where users receive advice from other individuals, and (2) AI-assisted support using large language models (LLMs).Our goal is to understand the strengths and limitations of each approach in supporting visualization troubleshooting tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To this end, we collected 889 Vega-Lite cases from Stack Overflow. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.704</span></span>We then conducted a comprehensive analysis to understand the types of questions users ask, the effectiveness of human and AI guidance, and the impact of supplementary resources, such as documentation and examples, on troubleshooting outcomes.Our findings reveal a striking contrast between human- and AI-assisted troubleshooting: Human-assisted troubleshooting provides tailored, context-sensitive advice but often varies in response quality, while AI-assisted troubleshooting offers rapid feedback but often requires additional contextual resources to achieve desired results.</p>

                  <p>Recent advances in text-to-image generation have enabled the creation of high-quality images with diverse applications.However, accurately describing desired visual attributes can be challenging, especially for non-experts in art and photography.An intuitive solution involves adopting favorable attributes from the source images.Current methods attempt to distill identity and style from source images.However, "style" is a broad concept that includes texture, color, and artistic elements, but does not cover other important attributes such as lighting and dynamics.Additionally, a simplified "style" adaptation prevents combining multiple attributes from different sources into one generated image.In this work, we formulate a more effective approach to decompose the aesthetics of a picture into specific visual attributes, allowing users to apply characteristics such as lighting, texture, and dynamics from different images.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To achieve this goal, we constructed the first fine-grained visual attributes dataset (FiVA) to the best of our knowledge. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.734</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This FiVA dataset features a well-organized taxonomy for visual attributes and includes around 1 M high-quality generated images with visual attribute annotations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.846</span></span>Leveraging this dataset, we propose a fine-grained visual attribute adaptation framework (FiVA-Adapter), which decouples and adapts visual attributes from one or more source images into a generated one.This approach enhances user-friendly customization, allowing users to selectively apply desired attributes to create images that meet their unique preferences and specific content requirements.</p>

                  <p>Recent 3D generation models typically rely on limited-scale 3D `gold-labels' or 2D diffusion priors for 3D content creation.However, their performance is upper-bounded by constrained 3D priors due to the lack of scalable learning paradigms.In this work, we present See3D, a visual-conditional multi-view diffusion model trained on large-scale Internet videos for open-world 3D creation.The model aims to Get 3D knowledge by solely Seeing the visual contents from the vast and rapidly growing video data -- You See it, You Got it.To achieve this, we first scale up the training data using a proposed data curation pipeline that automatically filters out multi-view inconsistencies and insufficient observations from source videos.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This results in a high-quality, richly diverse, large-scale dataset of multi-view images, termed WebVi3D, containing 320M frames from 16M video clips. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.794</span></span>Nevertheless, learning generic 3D priors from videos without explicit 3D geometry or camera pose annotations is nontrivial, and annotating poses for web-scale videos is prohibitively expensive.To eliminate the need for pose conditions, we introduce an innovative visual-condition - a purely 2D-inductive visual signal generated by adding time-dependent noise to the masked video data.Finally, we introduce a novel visual-conditional 3D generation framework by integrating See3D into a warping-based pipeline for high-fidelity 3D generation.Our numerical and visual comparisons on single and sparse reconstruction benchmarks show that See3D, trained on cost-effective and scalable video data, achieves notable zero-shot and open-world generation capabilities, markedly outperforming models trained on costly and constrained 3D datasets.Please refer to our project page at: https://vision.baai.ac.cn/see3d</p>

                  <p>Volumetric reconstruction of dynamic scenes is an important problem in computer vision.It is especially challenging in poor lighting and with fast motion.It is partly due to the limitations of RGB cameras: To capture fast motion without much blur, the framerate must be increased, which in turn requires more lighting.In contrast, event cameras, which record changes in pixel brightness asynchronously, are much less dependent on lighting, making them more suitable for recording fast motion.We hence propose the first method to spatiotemporally reconstruct a scene from sparse multi-view event streams and sparse RGB frames.We train a sequence of cross-faded time-conditioned NeRF models, one per short recording segment.The individual segments are supervised with a set of event- and RGB-based losses and sparse-view regularisation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We assemble a real-world multi-view camera rig with six static event cameras around the object and record a benchmark multi-view event stream dataset of challenging motions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.723</span></span>Our work outperforms RGB-based baselines, producing state-of-the-art results, and opens up the topic of multi-view event-based reconstruction as a new path for fast scene capture beyond RGB cameras.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code and the data will be released soon at https://4dqv.mpi-inf.mpg.de/DynEventNeRF/ <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.752</span></span></p>

                  <p>Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP have been cherished for their ability to perform zero-shot visual recognition on open-vocabulary concepts.This is achieved by selecting the object category whose textual representation bears the highest similarity with the query image.While successful in some domains, this method struggles with identifying fine-grained entities as well as generalizing to unseen concepts that are not captured by the training distribution.Recent works attempt to mitigate these challenges by integrating category descriptions at test time, albeit yielding modest improvements.We attribute these limited gains to a fundamental misalignment between image and description representations, which is rooted in the pretraining structure of CLIP.In this paper, we propose GRAIN, a new pretraining strategy aimed at aligning representations at both fine and coarse levels simultaneously.Our approach learns to jointly ground textual descriptions in image regions along with aligning overarching captions with global image representations.To drive this pre-training, we leverage frozen Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to derive large-scale synthetic annotations.We demonstrate the enhanced zero-shot performance of our model compared to current state-of-the art methods across 11 diverse image classification datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, we introduce Products-2023, a newly curated, manually labeled dataset featuring novel concepts, and showcase our model's ability to recognize these concepts by benchmarking on it. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.745</span></span>Significant improvements achieved by our model on other downstream tasks like retrieval further highlight the superior quality of representations learned by our approach.Code available at https://github.com/shaunak27/grain-clip .</p>

                  <p>Esophageal cancer is among the most common types of cancer worldwide.It is traditionally treated using open esophagectomy, but in recent years, robot-assisted minimally invasive esophagectomy (RAMIE) has emerged as a promising alternative.However, robot-assisted surgery can be challenging for novice surgeons, as they often suffer from a loss of spatial orientation.Computer-aided anatomy recognition holds promise for improving surgical navigation, but research in this area remains limited.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this study, we developed a comprehensive dataset for semantic segmentation in RAMIE, featuring the largest collection of vital anatomical structures and surgical instruments to date. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.781</span></span>Handling this diverse set of classes presents challenges, including class imbalance and the recognition of complex structures such as nerves.This study aims to understand the challenges and limitations of current state-of-the-art algorithms on this novel dataset and problem.Therefore, we benchmarked eight real-time deep learning models using two pretraining datasets.We assessed both traditional and attention-based networks, hypothesizing that attention-based networks better capture global patterns and address challenges such as occlusion caused by blood or other tissues.The benchmark includes our RAMIE dataset and the publicly available CholecSeg8k dataset, enabling a thorough assessment of surgical segmentation tasks.Our findings indicate that pretraining on ADE20k, a dataset for semantic segmentation, is more effective than pretraining on ImageNet.Furthermore, attention-based models outperform traditional convolutional neural networks, with SegNeXt and Mask2Former achieving higher Dice scores, and Mask2Former additionally excelling in average symmetric surface distance.</p>

Two defense methods are presented.The first, termed label-preserving poisoning attacks for all output vectors (LPA), involves subtle perturbations to all output vectors while preserving their labels.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings demonstrate that these minor perturbations, introduced through a data poisoning approach, significantly increase the difficulty of data reconstruction without compromising the utility of the classifier. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>Subsequently, we introduce a second method, label-flipping poisoning for partial output vectors (LFP), which selectively perturbs a small subset of output vectors and alters their labels during the process.Empirical results indicate that LPA is notably effective, outperforming the current state-of-the-art defenses.Our data poisoning-based defense provides a new retraining-free defense paradigm that preserves the victim classifier's utility.</p>

                  <p>Fiber orientation is decisive for the mechanical properties and thus for the performance of composite materials.During manufacturing, variations in material and process parameters can significantly influence the exact fiber orientation.We employ multilevel polynomial surrogates to model the propagation of uncertain material properties in the injection molding process.To ensure reliable uncertainty quantification, a key focus is deriving novel error bounds for statistical measures of a quantity of interest, computed via these surrogates.To verify these bounds, we conduct numerical experiments using the Cross-WLF viscosity model alongside the Hagen-Poiseuille flow in a rectangular channel.In particular, the impact of uncertainties in fiber length and matrix temperature on the fractional anisotropy of fiber orientation is investigated.The Folgar-Tucker equation and the improved anisotropic rotary diffusion model are used, incorporating recently established analytical solutions of these models as part of our verification.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results demonstrate that the investigated method significantly improves upon standard Monte Carlo estimation, while also providing error guarantees. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.699</span></span>These findings offer the first step toward a reliable and practical tool for optimizing fiber-reinforced polymer manufacturing processes in the future.</p>

                  <p>Public health practitioners often have the goal of monitoring patients and maximizing patients' time spent in "favorable" or healthy states while being constrained to using limited resources.Restless multi-armed bandits (RMAB) are an effective model to solve this problem as they are helpful to allocate limited resources among many agents under resource constraints, where patients behave differently depending on whether they are intervened on or not.However, RMABs assume the reward function is known.This is unrealistic in many public health settings because patients face unique challenges and it is impossible for a human to know who is most deserving of any intervention at such a large scale.To address this shortcoming, this paper is the first to present the use of inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to learn desired rewards for RMABs, and we demonstrate improved outcomes in a maternal and child health telehealth program.First we allow public health experts to specify their goals at an aggregate or population level and propose an algorithm to design expert trajectories at scale based on those goals.Second, our algorithm WHIRL uses gradient updates to optimize the objective, allowing for efficient and accurate learning of RMAB rewards.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Third, we compare with existing baselines and outperform those in terms of run-time and accuracy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.742</span></span>Finally, we evaluate and show the usefulness of WHIRL on thousands on beneficiaries from a real-world maternal and child health setting in India.We publicly release our code here: https://github.com/Gjain234/WHIRL.</p>

                  <p>Domain Generalization (DG) seeks to transfer knowledge from multiple source domains to unseen target domains, even in the presence of domain shifts.Achieving effective generalization typically requires a large and diverse set of labeled source data to learn robust representations that can generalize to new, unseen domains.However, obtaining such high-quality labeled data is often costly and labor-intensive, limiting the practical applicability of DG.To address this, we investigate a more practical and challenging problem: semi-supervised domain generalization (SSDG) under a label-efficient paradigm.In this paper, we propose a novel method, CAT, which leverages semi-supervised learning with limited labeled data to achieve competitive generalization performance under domain shifts.Our method addresses key limitations of previous approaches, such as reliance on fixed thresholds and sensitivity to noisy pseudo-labels.CAT combines adaptive thresholding with noisy label refinement techniques, creating a straightforward yet highly effective solution for SSDG tasks.Specifically, our approach uses flexible thresholding to generate high-quality pseudo-labels with higher class diversity while refining noisy pseudo-labels to improve their reliability.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method, highlighting its effectiveness in achieving robust generalization under domain shift. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.635</span></span></p>

Our main contribution is three exact algorithms that are efficient when considering particular structures for the input network.We provide such algorithms for the case when the communication range and the number of agents (the makespan resp.)are provided in the input and the network has a tree topology, or bounded maximum degree (has a tree-like topology, i.e., bounded treewidth resp.).We complement these results by showing that it is highly unlikely to construct efficient algorithms when considering the number of agents as part of the input, even if the makespan is $3$ and the communication range is $1$.</p>

                  <p>Offline Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is an emerging field that aims to learn optimal multi-agent policies from pre-collected datasets.Compared to single-agent case, multi-agent setting involves a large joint state-action space and coupled behaviors of multiple agents, which bring extra complexity to offline policy optimization.In this work, we revisit the existing offline MARL methods and show that in certain scenarios they can be problematic, leading to uncoordinated behaviors and out-of-distribution (OOD) joint actions.To address these issues, we propose a new offline MARL algorithm, named In-Sample Sequential Policy Optimization (InSPO).InSPO sequentially updates each agent's policy in an in-sample manner, which not only avoids selecting OOD joint actions but also carefully considers teammates' updated policies to enhance coordination.Additionally, by thoroughly exploring low-probability actions in the behavior policy, InSPO can well address the issue of premature convergence to sub-optimal solutions.Theoretically, we prove InSPO guarantees monotonic policy improvement and converges to quantal response equilibrium (QRE).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared to current state-of-the-art offline MARL methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.635</span></span></p>

                  <p>Despite the widespread use of LLMs due to their superior performance in various tasks, their high computational costs often lead potential users to opt for the pretraining-finetuning pipeline.However, biases prevalent in manually constructed datasets can introduce spurious correlations between tokens and labels, creating so-called shortcuts and hindering the generalizability of fine-tuned models.Existing debiasing methods often rely on prior knowledge of specific dataset biases, which is challenging to acquire a priori.We propose RAZOR (Rewriting And Zero-bias Optimization Refinement), a novel, unsupervised, and data-focused debiasing approach based on text rewriting for shortcut mitigation.RAZOR leverages LLMs to iteratively rewrite potentially biased text segments by replacing them with heuristically selected alternatives in a shortcut space defined by token statistics and positional information.This process aims to align surface-level text features more closely with diverse label distributions, thereby promoting the learning of genuine linguistic patterns.Compared with unsupervised SoTA models, RAZOR improves by 3.5% on the FEVER and 6.5% on MNLI and SNLI datasets according to the F1 score.Additionally, RAZOR effectively mitigates specific known biases, reducing bias-related terms by x2 without requiring prior bias information, a result that is on par with SoTA models that leverage prior information.Our work prioritizes data manipulation over architectural modifications, emphasizing the pivotal role of data quality in enhancing model performance and fairness.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This research contributes to developing more robust evaluation benchmarks for debiasing methods by incorporating metrics for bias reduction and overall model efficacy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.714</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent advances in learning decision-making policies can largely be attributed to training expressive policy models, largely via imitation learning.While imitation learning discards non-expert data, reinforcement learning (RL) can still learn from suboptimal data.However, instantiating RL training of a new policy class often presents a different challenge: most deep RL machinery is co-developed with assumptions on the policy class and backbone, resulting in poor performance when the policy class changes.For instance, SAC utilizes a low-variance reparameterization policy gradient for Gaussian policies, but this is unstable for diffusion policies and intractable for autoregressive categorical policies.To address this issue, we develop an offline RL and online fine-tuning approach called policy-agnostic RL (PA-RL) that can effectively train multiple policy classes, with varying architectures and sizes.We build off the basic idea that a universal supervised learning loss can replace the policy improvement step in RL, as long as it is applied on "optimized" actions.To obtain these optimized actions, we first sample multiple actions from a base policy, and run global optimization (i.e., re-ranking multiple action samples using the Q-function) and local optimization (i.e., running gradient steps on an action sample) to maximize the critic on these candidates.PA-RL enables fine-tuning diffusion and transformer policies with either autoregressive tokens or continuous action outputs, at different sizes, entirely via actor-critic RL.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, PA-RL improves the performance and sample-efficiency by up to 2 times compared to existing offline RL and online fine-tuning methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.617</span></span>We show the first result that successfully fine-tunes OpenVLA, a 7B generalist robot policy, autonomously with Cal-QL, an online RL fine-tuning algorithm, improving from 40% to 70% in the real world in 40 minutes.</p>

                  <p>Despite the remarkable performance of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) across diverse tasks, the substantial training and inference costs impede their advancement.The majority of computation stems from the overwhelming volume of vision tokens processed by the transformer decoder.In this paper, we propose to build efficient MLLMs by leveraging the Mixture-of-Depths (MoD) mechanism, where each transformer decoder layer selects essential vision tokens to process while skipping redundant ones.However, integrating MoD into MLLMs is non-trivial.To address the challenges of training and inference stability as well as limited training data, we adapt the MoD module with two novel designs: tanh-gated weight normalization (TanhNorm) and symmetric token reweighting (STRing).Moreover, we observe that vision tokens exhibit higher redundancy in deeper layer and thus design a progressive ratio decay (PRD) strategy, which gradually reduces the token retention ratio layer by layer, employing a shifted cosine schedule.This crucial design fully unleashes the potential of MoD, significantly boosting the efficiency and performance of our models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments with two baseline models across 14 benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.746</span></span>Our model, p-MoD, matches or even surpasses the performance of the baseline models, with only 55.6% TFLOPs and 53.8% KV cache storage during inference, and 77.7% GPU hours during training.</p>

We present TurboAttention, a comprehensive approach to enable quantized execution of attention that simultaneously addresses both memory and computational efficiency.Our solution introduces two key innovations: FlashQ, a headwise attention quantization technique that enables both compression of KV cache and quantized execution of activation-activation multiplication, and Sparsity-based Softmax Approximation (SAS), which eliminates the need for dequantization to FP32 during exponentiation operation in attention.Experimental results demonstrate that TurboAttention achieves 1.2-1.8x speedup in attention, reduces the KV cache size by over 4.4x, and enables up to 2.37x maximum throughput over the FP16 baseline while outperforming state-of-the-art quantization and compression techniques across various datasets and models.</p>
