                  <p>Contrastive Language Image Pre-training (CLIP) has recently demonstrated success across various tasks due to superior feature representation empowered by image-text contrastive learning.However, the instance discrimination method used by CLIP can hardly encode the semantic structure of training data.To handle this limitation, cluster discrimination has been proposed through iterative cluster assignment and classification.Nevertheless, most cluster discrimination approaches only define a single pseudo-label for each image, neglecting multi-label signals in the image.In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-Label Cluster Discrimination method named MLCD to enhance representation learning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In the clustering step, we first cluster the large-scale LAION-400M dataset into one million centers based on off-the-shelf embedding features. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.719</span></span>Considering that natural images frequently contain multiple visual objects or attributes, we select the multiple closest centers as auxiliary class labels.In the discrimination step, we design a novel multi-label classification loss, which elegantly separates losses from positive classes and negative classes, and alleviates ambiguity on decision boundary.We validate the proposed multi-label cluster discrimination method with experiments on different scales of models and pre-training datasets.Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple downstream tasks including linear probe, zero-shot classification, and image-text retrieval.</p>

                  <p>This study presents estimates of the global expenditure on article processing charges (APCs) paid to six publishers for open access between 2019 and 2023.APCs are fees charged for publishing in some fully open access journals (gold) and in subscription journals to make individual articles open access (hybrid).There is currently no way to systematically track institutional, national or global expenses for open access publishing due to a lack of transparency in APC prices, what articles they are paid for, or who pays them.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We therefore curated and used an open dataset of annual APC list prices from Elsevier, Frontiers, MDPI, PLOS, Springer Nature, and Wiley in combination with the number of open access articles from these publishers indexed by OpenAlex to estimate that, globally, a total of \$8.349 billion (\$8.968 billion in 2023 US dollars) were spent on APCs between 2019 and 2023. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.734</span></span>We estimate that in 2023 MDPI (\$681.6 million), Elsevier (\$582.8 million) and Springer Nature (\$546.6) generated the most revenue with APCs.After adjusting for inflation, we also show that annual spending almost tripled from \$910.3 million in 2019 to \$2.538 billion in 2023, that hybrid exceed gold fees, and that the median APCs paid are higher than the median listed fees for both gold and hybrid.Our approach addresses major limitations in previous efforts to estimate APCs paid and offers much needed insight into an otherwise opaque aspect of the business of scholarly publishing.We call upon publishers to be more transparent about OA fees.</p>

                  <p>As short-form video-sharing platforms become a significant channel for news consumption, fake news in short videos has emerged as a serious threat in the online information ecosystem, making developing detection methods for this new scenario an urgent need.Compared with that in text and image formats, fake news on short video platforms contains rich but heterogeneous information in various modalities, posing a challenge to effective feature utilization.Unlike existing works mostly focusing on analyzing what is presented, we introduce a novel perspective that considers how it might be created.Through the lens of the creative process behind news video production, our empirical analysis uncovers the unique characteristics of fake news videos in material selection and editing.Based on the obtained insights, we design FakingRecipe, a creative process-aware model for detecting fake news short videos.It captures the fake news preferences in material selection from sentimental and semantic aspects and considers the traits of material editing from spatial and temporal aspects.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To improve evaluation comprehensiveness, we first construct FakeTT, an English dataset for this task, and conduct experiments on both FakeTT and the existing Chinese FakeSV dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.76</span></span>The results show FakingRecipe's superiority in detecting fake news on short video platforms.</p>

                  <p>Weakly supervised video object segmentation (WSVOS) enables the identification of segmentation maps without requiring an extensive training dataset of object masks, relying instead on coarse video labels indicating object presence.Current state-of-the-art methods either require multiple independent stages of processing that employ motion cues or, in the case of end-to-end trainable networks, lack in segmentation accuracy, in part due to the difficulty of learning segmentation maps from videos with transient object presence.This limits the application of WSVOS for semantic annotation of surgical videos where multiple surgical tools frequently move in and out of the field of view, a problem that is more difficult than typically encountered in WSVOS.This paper introduces Video Spatio-Temporal Disentanglement Networks (VDST-Net), a framework to disentangle spatiotemporal information using semi-decoupled knowledge distillation to predict high-quality class activation maps (CAMs).A teacher network designed to resolve temporal conflicts when specifics about object location and timing in the video are not provided works with a student network that integrates information over time by leveraging temporal dependencies.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework on a public reference dataset and on a more challenging surgical video dataset where objects are, on average, present in less than 60\% of annotated frames. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.756</span></span>Our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques and generates superior segmentation masks under video-level weak supervision.</p>

                  <p>Facial Recognition Systems (FRSs) are being developed and deployed globally at unprecedented rates.Most platforms are designed in a limited set of countries but deployed in worldwide, without adequate checkpoints.This is especially problematic for Global South countries which lack strong legislation to safeguard persons facing disparate performance of these systems.A combination of unavailability of datasets, lack of understanding of FRS functionality and low-resource bias mitigation measures accentuate the problem.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we propose a new face dataset composed of 6,579 unique male and female sportspersons from eight countries around the world. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.894</span></span>More than 50% of the dataset comprises individuals from the Global South countries and is demographically diverse.To aid adversarial audits and robust model training, each image has four adversarial variants, totaling over 40,000 images.We also benchmark five popular FRSs, both commercial and open-source, for the task of gender prediction (and country prediction for one of the open-source models as an example of red-teaming).Experiments on industrial FRSs reveal accuracies ranging from 98.2%--38.1%, with a large disparity between males and females in the Global South (max difference of 38.5%).Biases are also observed in all FRSs between females of the Global North and South (max difference of ~50%).Grad-CAM analysis identifies the nose, forehead and mouth as the regions of interest on one of the open-source FRSs.Utilizing this insight, we design simple, low-resource bias mitigation solutions using few-shot and novel contrastive learning techniques significantly improving the accuracy with disparity between males and females reducing from 50% to 1.5% in one of the settings.In the red-teaming experiment with the open-source Deepface model, contrastive learning proves more effective than simple fine-tuning.</p>

                  <p>Video generation models (VGMs) have demonstrated the capability to synthesize high-quality output.It is important to understand their potential to produce unsafe content, such as violent or terrifying videos.In this work, we provide a comprehensive understanding of unsafe video generation.   First, to confirm the possibility that these models could indeed generate unsafe videos, we choose unsafe content generation prompts collected from 4chan and Lexica, and three open-source SOTA VGMs to generate unsafe videos.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>After filtering out duplicates and poorly generated content, we created an initial set of 2112 unsafe videos from an original pool of 5607 videos. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.829</span></span>Through clustering and thematic coding analysis of these generated videos, we identify 5 unsafe video categories: Distorted/Weird, Terrifying, Pornographic, Violent/Bloody, and Political.With IRB approval, we then recruit online participants to help label the generated videos.Based on the annotations submitted by 403 participants, we identified 937 unsafe videos from the initial video set.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>With the labeled information and the corresponding prompts, we created the first dataset of unsafe videos generated by VGMs.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.773</span></span>We then study possible defense mechanisms to prevent the generation of unsafe videos.Existing defense methods in image generation focus on filtering either input prompt or output results.We propose a new approach called Latent Variable Defense (LVD), which works within the model's internal sampling process.LVD can achieve 0.90 defense accuracy while reducing time and computing resources by 10x when sampling a large number of unsafe prompts.</p>

                  <p>Sign language is one of the most effective communication tools for people with hearing difficulties.Most existing works focus on improving the performance of sign language tasks on RGB videos, which may suffer from degraded recording conditions, such as fast movement of hands with motion blur and textured signer's appearance.The bio-inspired event camera, which asynchronously captures brightness change with high speed, could naturally perceive dynamic hand movements, providing rich manual clues for sign language tasks.In this work, we aim at exploring the potential of event camera in continuous sign language recognition (CSLR) and sign language translation (SLT).To promote the research, we first collect an event-based benchmark EvSign for those tasks with both gloss and spoken language annotations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>EvSign dataset offers a substantial amount of high-quality event streams and an extensive vocabulary of glosses and words, thereby facilitating the development of sign language tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.761</span></span>In addition, we propose an efficient transformer-based framework for event-based SLR and SLT tasks, which fully leverages the advantages of streaming events.The sparse backbone is employed to extract visual features from sparse events.Then, the temporal coherence is effectively utilized through the proposed local token fusion and gloss-aware temporal aggregation modules.Extensive experimental results are reported on both simulated (PHOENIX14T) and EvSign datasets.Our method performs favorably against existing state-of-the-art approaches with only 0.34% computational cost (0.84G FLOPS per video) and 44.2% network parameters.The project is available at https://zhang-pengyu.github.io/EVSign.</p>

                  <p>High-quality 3D photoacoustic imaging (PAI) reconstruction under sparse view or limited view has long been challenging.Traditional 3D iterative-based reconstruction methods suffer from both slow speed and high memory consumption.Recently, in computer graphics, the differentiable rendering has made significant progress, particularly with the rise of 3D Gaussian Splatting.Inspired by these, we introduce differentiable radiation into PAI, developing a novel reconstruction algorithm: the Sliding Ball Adaptive Growth algorithm (SlingBAG) for 3D PAI, which shows ability in high-quality 3D PAI reconstruction both under extremely sparse view and limited view.   We established the point cloud dataset in PAI, and used unique differentiable rapid radiator based on the spherical decomposition strategy and the randomly initialized point cloud adaptively optimized according to sparse sensor data.Each point undergoes updates in 3D coordinates, initial pressure, and resolution (denoted by the radius of ball).Points undergo adaptive growth during iterative process, including point destroying, splitting and duplicating along the gradient of their positions, manifesting the sliding ball effect.   Finally, our point cloud to voxel grid shader renders the final reconstruction results.Simulation and in vivo experiments demonstrate that our SlingBAG reconstruction result's SNR can be more than 40 dB under extremely sparse view, while the SNR of traditional back-projection algorithm's result is less than 20 dB. Moreover, the result of SlingBAG's structural similarity to the ground truth is significantly higher, with an SSIM value of 95.6%.   Notably, our differentiable rapid radiator can conduct forward PA simulation in homogeneous, non-viscous media substantially faster than current methods that numerically simulate the wave propagation, such as k-Wave.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset and all code will be open source. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.901</span></span></p>

                  <p>The United States Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) Premarket Notification 510(K) pathway allows manufacturers to gain approval for a medical device by demonstrating its substantial equivalence to another legally marketed device.However, the inherent ambiguity of this regulatory procedure has led to high recall rates for many devices cleared through this pathway.This trend has raised significant concerns regarding the efficacy of the FDA's current approach, prompting a reassessment of the 510(K) regulatory framework.In this paper, we develop a combined human-algorithm approach to assist the FDA in improving its 510(k) medical device clearance process by reducing the risk of potential recalls and the workload imposed on the FDA.We first develop machine learning methods to estimate the risk of recall of 510(k) medical devices based on the information available at the time of submission.We then propose a data-driven clearance policy that recommends acceptance, rejection, or deferral to FDA's committees for in-depth evaluation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct an empirical study using a unique large-scale dataset of over 31,000 medical devices and 12,000 national and international manufacturers from over 65 countries that we assembled based on data sources from the FDA and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service (CMS). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.725</span></span>A conservative evaluation of our proposed policy based on this data shows a 38.9% improvement in the recall rate and a 43.0% reduction in the FDA's workload.Our analyses also indicate that implementing our policy could result in significant annual cost-savings ranging between \$2.4 billion and \$2.7 billion, which highlights the value of using a holistic and data-driven approach to improve the FDA's current 510(K) medical device evaluation pathway.</p>

                  <p>Objects, in particular tools, provide several action possibilities to the agents that can act on them, which are generally associated with the term of affordances.A tool is typically designed for a specific purpose, such as driving a nail in the case of a hammer, which we call as the primary affordance.A tool can also be used beyond its primary purpose, in which case we can associate this auxiliary use with the term secondary affordance.Previous work on affordance perception and learning has been mostly focused on primary affordances.Here, we address the less explored problem of learning the secondary tool affordances of human partners.To do this, we use the iCub robot to observe human partners with three cameras while they perform actions on twenty objects using four different tools.In our experiments, human partners utilize tools to perform actions that do not correspond to their primary affordances.For example, the iCub robot observes a human partner using a ruler for pushing, pulling, and moving objects instead of measuring their lengths.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this setting, we constructed a dataset by taking images of objects before and after each action is executed. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.799</span></span>We then model learning secondary affordances by training three neural networks (ResNet-18, ResNet-50, and ResNet-101) each on three tasks, using raw images showing the `initial' and `final' position of objects as input: (1) predicting the tool used to move an object, (2) predicting the tool used with an additional categorical input that encoded the action performed, and (3) joint prediction of both tool used and action performed.Our results indicate that deep learning architectures enable the iCub robot to predict secondary tool affordances, thereby paving the road for human-robot collaborative object manipulation involving complex affordances.</p>

                  <p>We present the Code Documentation and Analysis Tool (CoDAT).CoDAT is a tool designed to maintain consistency between the various levels of code documentation, e.g. if a line in a code sketch is changed, the comment that documents the corresponding code is also changed.That is, comments are linked and updated so as to remain internally consistent and also consistent with the code.By flagging "out of date" comments, CoDAT alerts the developer to maintain up-to-date documentation.   We use a large language model to check the semantic consistency between a fragment of code and the comments that describe it.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Thus we also flag semantic inconsistency as well as out of date comments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.609</span></span>This helps programers write code that correctly implements a code sketch, and so provides machine support for a step-wise refinement approach, starting with a code sketch and proceeding down to code through one or more refinement iterations.   CoDAT is implemented in the Intellij IDEA IDE where we use the Code Insight daemon package alongside a custom regular expression algorithm to mark tagged comments whose corresponding code blocks have changed.CoDAT's backend is structurally decentralized to allow a distributed ledger framework for code consistency and architectural compilation tracking.</p>

                  <p>Deep neural networks are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, a type of adversarial attack that poisons the training data to manipulate the behavior of models trained on such data.Clean-label attacks are a more stealthy form of backdoor attacks that can perform the attack without changing the labels of poisoned data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Early works on clean-label attacks added triggers to a random subset of the training set, ignoring the fact that samples contribute unequally to the attack's success. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.633</span></span>This results in high poisoning rates and low attack success rates.To alleviate the problem, several supervised learning-based sample selection strategies have been proposed.However, these methods assume access to the entire labeled training set and require training, which is expensive and may not always be practical.This work studies a new and more practical (but also more challenging) threat model where the attacker only provides data for the target class (e.g., in face recognition systems) and has no knowledge of the victim model or any other classes in the training set.We study different strategies for selectively poisoning a small set of training samples in the target class to boost the attack success rate in this setting.Our threat model poses a serious threat in training machine learning models with third-party datasets, since the attack can be performed effectively with limited information.Experiments on benchmark datasets illustrate the effectiveness of our strategies in improving clean-label backdoor attacks.</p>

                  <p>Semi-Supervised Visual Grounding (SSVG) is a new challenge for its sparse labeled data with the need for multimodel understanding.A previous study, RefTeacher, makes the first attempt to tackle this task by adopting the teacher-student framework to provide pseudo confidence supervision and attention-based supervision.However, this approach is incompatible with current state-of-the-art visual grounding models, which follow the Transformer-based pipeline.These pipelines directly regress results without region proposals or foreground binary classification, rendering them unsuitable for fitting in RefTeacher due to the absence of confidence scores.Furthermore, the geometric difference in teacher and student inputs, stemming from different data augmentations, induces natural misalignment in attention-based constraints.To establish a compatible SSVG framework, our paper proposes the ACTive REtraining approach for Semi-Supervised Visual Grounding, abbreviated as ACTRESS.Initially, the model is enhanced by incorporating an additional quantized detection head to expose its detection confidence.Building upon this, ACTRESS consists of an active sampling strategy and a selective retraining strategy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The active sampling strategy iteratively selects high-quality pseudo labels by evaluating three crucial aspects: Faithfulness, Robustness, and Confidence, optimizing the utilization of unlabeled data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span>The selective retraining strategy retrains the model with periodic re-initialization of specific parameters, facilitating the model's escape from local minima.Extensive experiments demonstrates our superior performance on widely-used benchmark datasets.</p>

                  <p>As learning-to-rank models are increasingly deployed for decision-making in areas with profound life implications, the FairML community has been developing fair learning-to-rank (LTR) models.These models rely on the availability of sensitive demographic features such as race or sex.However, in practice, regulatory obstacles and privacy concerns protect this data from collection and use.As a result, practitioners may either need to promote fairness despite the absence of these features or turn to demographic inference tools to attempt to infer them.Given that these tools are fallible, this paper aims to further understand how errors in demographic inference impact the fairness performance of popular fair LTR strategies.In which cases would it be better to keep such demographic attributes hidden from models versus infer them?We examine a spectrum of fair LTR strategies ranging from fair LTR with and without demographic features hidden versus inferred to fairness-unaware LTR followed by fair re-ranking.We conduct a controlled empirical investigation modeling different levels of inference errors by systematically perturbing the inferred sensitive attribute.We also perform three case studies with real-world datasets and popular open-source inference methods.Our findings reveal that as inference noise grows, LTR-based methods that incorporate fairness considerations into the learning process may increase bias.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In contrast, fair re-ranking strategies are more robust to inference errors. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>All source code, data, and experimental artifacts of our experimental study are available here: https://github.com/sewen007/hoiltr.git</p>

                  <p>This paper investigates multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL), which focuses on learning Pareto optimal policies in the presence of multiple reward functions.Despite MORL's significant empirical success, there is still a lack of satisfactory understanding of various MORL optimization targets and efficient learning algorithms.Our work offers a systematic analysis of several optimization targets to assess their abilities to find all Pareto optimal policies and controllability over learned policies by the preferences for different objectives.We then identify Tchebycheff scalarization as a favorable scalarization method for MORL.Considering the non-smoothness of Tchebycheff scalarization, we reformulate its minimization problem into a new min-max-max optimization problem.Then, for the stochastic policy class, we propose efficient algorithms using this reformulation to learn Pareto optimal policies.We first propose an online UCB-based algorithm to achieve an $\varepsilon$ learning error with an $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\varepsilon^{-2})$ sample complexity for a single given preference.To further reduce the cost of environment exploration under different preferences, we propose a preference-free framework that first explores the environment without pre-defined preferences and then generates solutions for any number of preferences.We prove that it only requires an $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\varepsilon^{-2})$ exploration complexity in the exploration phase and demands no additional exploration afterward.Lastly, we analyze the smooth Tchebycheff scalarization, an extension of Tchebycheff scalarization, which is proved to be more advantageous in distinguishing the Pareto optimal policies from other weakly Pareto optimal policies based on entry values of preference vectors.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we extend our algorithms and theoretical analysis to accommodate this optimization target. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.644</span></span></p>

                  <p>While the automated detection of cryptographic API misuses has progressed significantly, its precision diminishes for intricate targets due to the reliance on manually defined patterns.Large Language Models (LLMs), renowned for their contextual understanding, offer a promising avenue to address existing shortcomings.However, applying LLMs in this security-critical domain presents challenges, particularly due to the unreliability stemming from LLMs' stochastic nature and the well-known issue of hallucination.To explore the prevalence of LLMs' unreliable analysis and potential solutions, this paper introduces a systematic evaluation framework to assess LLMs in detecting cryptographic misuses, utilizing a comprehensive dataset encompassing both manually-crafted samples and real-world projects.Our in-depth analysis of 11,940 LLM-generated reports highlights that the inherent instabilities in LLMs can lead to over half of the reports being false positives.Nevertheless, we demonstrate how a constrained problem scope, coupled with LLMs' self-correction capability, significantly enhances the reliability of the detection.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The optimized approach achieves a remarkable detection rate of nearly 90%, surpassing traditional methods and uncovering previously unknown misuses in established benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.642</span></span>Moreover, we identify the failure patterns that persistently hinder LLMs' reliability, including both cryptographic knowledge deficiency and code semantics misinterpretation.Guided by these insights, we develop an LLM-based workflow to examine open-source repositories, leading to the discovery of 63 real-world cryptographic misuses.Of these, 46 have been acknowledged by the development community, with 23 currently being addressed and 6 resolved.Reflecting on developers' feedback, we offer recommendations for future research and the development of LLM-based security tools.</p>

                  <p>Community researchers have developed a range of advanced audio-visual segmentation models aimed at improving the quality of sounding objects' masks.While masks created by these models may initially appear plausible, they occasionally exhibit anomalies with incorrect grounding logic.We attribute this to real-world inherent preferences and distributions as a simpler signal for learning than the complex audio-visual grounding, which leads to the disregard of important modality information.Generally, the anomalous phenomena are often complex and cannot be directly observed systematically.In this study, we made a pioneering effort with the proper synthetic data to categorize and analyze phenomena as two types "audio priming bias" and "visual prior" according to the source of anomalies.For audio priming bias, to enhance audio sensitivity to different intensities and semantics, a perception module specifically for audio perceives the latent semantic information and incorporates information into a limited set of queries, namely active queries.Moreover, the interaction mechanism related to such active queries in the transformer decoder is customized to adapt to the need for interaction regulating among audio semantics.For visual prior, multiple contrastive training strategies are explored to optimize the model by incorporating a biased branch, without even changing the structure of the model.During experiments, observation demonstrates the presence and the impact that has been produced by the biases of the existing model.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, through experimental evaluation of AVS benchmarks, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods in handling both types of biases, achieving competitive performance across all three subsets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.709</span></span></p>

                  <p>Removing audio effects from electric guitar recordings makes it easier for post-production and sound editing.An audio distortion recovery model not only improves the clarity of the guitar sounds but also opens up new opportunities for creative adjustments in mixing and mastering.While progress have been made in creating such models, previous efforts have largely focused on synthetic distortions that may be too simplistic to accurately capture the complexities seen in real-world recordings.   In this paper, we tackle the task by using a dataset of guitar recordings rendered with commercial-grade audio effect VST plugins.Moreover, we introduce a novel two-stage methodology for audio distortion recovery.The idea is to firstly process the audio signal in the Mel-spectrogram domain in the first stage, and then use a neural vocoder to generate the pristine original guitar sound from the processed Mel-spectrogram in the second stage.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We report a set of experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach over existing methods, through both subjective and objective evaluation metrics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.67</span></span></p>

                  <p>Despite the proliferation of large vision-language foundation models, estimation of the learning and forgetting outcomes following fine-tuning of these models remains largely unexplored.Inspired by work highlighting the significance of the modality gap in contrastive dual-encoders, we propose the Inter-Intra Modal Measure (IIMM).Combining terms quantifying the similarity between image embeddings and the similarity between incorrect image and label embedding pairs, the IIMM functions as a strong predictor of performance changes with fine-tuning.Our extensive empirical analysis across four state-of-the-art vision-language models (CLIP, SigLIP, CoCa, EVA-02-CLIP) and five fine-tuning techniques (full fine-tuning, BitFit, attention-weight tuning, LoRA, CLIP-Adapter) demonstrates a strong, statistically significant linear relationship: fine-tuning on tasks with higher IIMM scores produces greater in-domain performance gains but also induces more severe out-of-domain performance degradation, with some parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods showing extreme forgetting.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We compare our measure against transfer scores from state-of-the-art model selection methods and show that the IIMM is significantly more predictive of accuracy gains. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.619</span></span>With only a single forward pass of the target data, practitioners can leverage this key insight to heuristically evaluate the degree to which a model can be expected to improve following fine-tuning.Given additional knowledge about the model's performance on a few diverse tasks, this heuristic further evolves into a strong predictor of expected performance changes when training for new tasks.</p>

Current research typically improves model generalization under normal shooting conditions through data augmentation techniques such as adjusting brightness and contrast.However, these methods pay less attention to the robustness of models under extreme shooting conditions.To tackle this, we propose a multi-mode synchronization learning (MMSL) strategy .This approach involves dividing images into grids, randomly selecting grid blocks, and applying data augmentation methods like contrast and brightness adjustments.This process introduces diverse transformations without altering the original image structure, helping the model adapt to extreme variations.This method improves the model's generalization under extreme conditions and enables learning diverse features, thus better addressing the challenges in re-ID.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on a simulated test set under extreme conditions have demonstrated the effectiveness of our method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.647</span></span>This approach is crucial for enhancing model robustness and adaptability in real-world scenarios, supporting the future development of person re-identification technology.</p>

                  <p>Deep convolutional neural networks have made significant breakthroughs in medical image classification, under the assumption that training samples from all classes are simultaneously available.However, in real-world medical scenarios, there's a common need to continuously learn about new diseases, leading to the emerging field of class incremental learning (CIL) in the medical domain.Typically, CIL suffers from catastrophic forgetting when trained on new classes.This phenomenon is mainly caused by the imbalance between old and new classes, and it becomes even more challenging with imbalanced medical datasets.In this work, we introduce two simple yet effective plug-in methods to mitigate the adverse effects of the imbalance.First, we propose a CIL-balanced classification loss to mitigate the classifier bias toward majority classes via logit adjustment.Second, we propose a distribution margin loss that not only alleviates the inter-class overlap in embedding space but also enforces the intra-class compactness.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate the effectiveness of our method with extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets (CCH5000, HAM10000, and EyePACS). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.733</span></span></p>

                  <p>Vision Transformers (ViT) have emerged as the de-facto choice for numerous industry grade vision solutions.But their inference cost can be prohibitive for many settings, as they compute self-attention in each layer which suffers from quadratic computational complexity in the number of tokens.On the other hand, spatial information in images and spatio-temporal information in videos is usually sparse and redundant.In this work, we introduce LookupViT, that aims to exploit this information sparsity to reduce ViT inference cost.LookupViT provides a novel general purpose vision transformer block that operates by compressing information from higher resolution tokens to a fixed number of tokens.These few compressed tokens undergo meticulous processing, while the higher-resolution tokens are passed through computationally cheaper layers.Information sharing between these two token sets is enabled through a bidirectional cross-attention mechanism.The approach offers multiple advantages - (a) easy to implement on standard ML accelerators (GPUs/TPUs) via standard high-level operators, (b) applicable to standard ViT and its variants, thus generalizes to various tasks, (c) can handle different tokenization and attention approaches.LookupViT also offers flexibility for the compressed tokens, enabling performance-computation trade-offs in a single trained model.We show LookupViT's effectiveness on multiple domains - (a) for image-classification (ImageNet-1K and ImageNet-21K), (b) video classification (Kinetics400 and Something-Something V2), (c) image captioning (COCO-Captions) with a frozen encoder.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>LookupViT provides $2\times$ reduction in FLOPs while upholding or improving accuracy across these domains. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span>In addition, LookupViT also demonstrates out-of-the-box robustness and generalization on image classification (ImageNet-C,R,A,O), improving by up to $4\%$ over ViT.</p>

                  <p>The advances of large foundation models necessitate wide-coverage, low-cost, and zero-contamination benchmarks.Despite continuous exploration of language model evaluations, comprehensive studies on the evaluation of Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs) remain limited.In this work, we introduce LMMS-EVAL, a unified and standardized multimodal benchmark framework with over 50 tasks and more than 10 models to promote transparent and reproducible evaluations.Although LMMS-EVAL offers comprehensive coverage, we find it still falls short in achieving low cost and zero contamination.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To approach this evaluation trilemma, we further introduce LMMS-EVAL LITE, a pruned evaluation toolkit that emphasizes both coverage and efficiency. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.61</span></span>Additionally, we present Multimodal LIVEBENCH that utilizes continuously updating news and online forums to assess models' generalization abilities in the wild, featuring a low-cost and zero-contamination evaluation approach.In summary, our work highlights the importance of considering the evaluation trilemma and provides practical solutions to navigate the trade-offs in evaluating large multi-modal models, paving the way for more effective and reliable benchmarking of LMMs.We opensource our codebase and maintain leaderboard of LIVEBENCH at https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/lmms-eval and https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmms-lab/LiveBench.</p>

The second part of this paper investigates the existence of effective equivalence between the validity of a formula and the validity of some prenex normal form.The existence of such a normal form is obvious for finite valued Goedel logic and $G_\uparrow$. Goedel logics with an uncountable truth value set admit the prenex normal forms if and only if every surrounding of 0 is uncountable or 0 is an isolated point.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Otherwise, uncountable Goedel logics are not recursively enumerable, however, the prenex fragment is always recursively enumerable. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.646</span></span>Therefore, there is no effective translation between the valid formula and the valid prenex normal form.However, the existence of effectively constructible validity equivalent prenex forms for the countable case is still up for debate.</p>

                Prompting Techniques for Secure Code Generation: A Systematic Investigation

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are gaining momentum in software development with prompt-driven programming enabling developers to create code from natural language (NL) instructions.However, studies have questioned their ability to produce secure code and, thereby, the quality of prompt-generated software.Alongside, various prompting techniques that carefully tailor prompts have emerged to elicit optimal responses from LLMs.Still, the interplay between such prompting strategies and secure code generation remains under-explored and calls for further investigations.OBJECTIVE:In this study, we investigate the impact of different prompting techniques on the security of code generated from NL instructions by LLMs.METHOD:<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>First we perform a systematic literature review to identify the existing prompting techniques that can be used for code generation tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.646</span></span>A subset of these techniques are evaluated on GPT-3, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 models for secure code generation.For this, we used an existing dataset consisting of 150 NL security-relevant code-generation prompts.RESULTS:Our work (i) classifies potential prompting techniques for code generation (ii) adapts and evaluates a subset of the identified techniques for secure code generation tasks and (iii) observes a reduction in security weaknesses across the tested LLMs, especially after using an existing technique called Recursive Criticism and Improvement (RCI), contributing valuable insights to the ongoing discourse on LLM-generated code security.</p>

                  <p>Solidity compiler plays a key role in enabling the development of smart contract applications on Ethereum by governing the syntax of a domain-specific language called Solidity and performing compilation and optimization of Solidity code.The correctness of Solidity compiler is critical in fostering transparency, efficiency, and trust in industries reliant on smart contracts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, like other software systems, Solidity compiler is prone to bugs, which may produce incorrect bytecodes on blockchain platforms, resulting in severe security concerns. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span>As a domain-specific compiler for smart contracts, Solidity compiler differs from other compilers in many perspectives, posing unique challenges to detect its bugs.To understand the bugs in Solidity compiler and benefit future research, in this paper, we present the first systematic study on 533 Solidity compiler bugs.We carefully examined their characteristics (including symptoms, root causes, and distribution), and their triggering test cases.Our study leads to seven bug-revealing takeaways for Solidity compiler.Moreover, to study the limitations of Solidity compiler fuzzers and bring our findings into practical scenarios, we evaluate three Solidity compiler fuzzers on our constructed benchmark.The results show that these fuzzers are inefficient in detecting Solidity compiler bugs.The inefficiency arises from their failure to consider the interesting bug-inducing features, bug-related compilation flags, and test oracles</p>
