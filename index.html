                  <p>In-context learning (ICL) is the ability of a model to learn a new task by observing a few exemplars in its context.While prevalent in NLP, this capability has recently also been observed in Reinforcement Learning (RL) settings.Prior in-context RL methods, however, require entire episodes in the agent's context.Given that complex environments typically lead to long episodes with sparse rewards, these methods are constrained to simple environments with short episodes.To address these challenges, we introduce Retrieval-Augmented Decision Transformer (RA-DT).RA-DT employs an external memory mechanism to store past experiences from which it retrieves only sub-trajectories relevant for the current situation.The retrieval component in RA-DT does not require training and can be entirely domain-agnostic.We evaluate the capabilities of RA-DT on grid-world environments, robotics simulations, and procedurally-generated video games.On grid-worlds, RA-DT outperforms baselines, while using only a fraction of their context length.Furthermore, we illuminate the limitations of current in-context RL methods on complex environments and discuss future directions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To facilitate future research, we release datasets for four of the considered environments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.855</span></span></p>

                  <p>Developing agents capable of navigating to a target location based on language instructions and visual information, known as vision-language navigation (VLN), has attracted widespread interest.Most research has focused on ground-based agents, while UAV-based VLN remains relatively underexplored.Recent efforts in UAV vision-language navigation predominantly adopt ground-based VLN settings, relying on predefined discrete action spaces and neglecting the inherent disparities in agent movement dynamics and the complexity of navigation tasks between ground and aerial environments.To address these disparities and challenges, we propose solutions from three perspectives: platform, benchmark, and methodology.To enable realistic UAV trajectory simulation in VLN tasks, we propose the OpenUAV platform, which features diverse environments, realistic flight control, and extensive algorithmic support.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We further construct a target-oriented VLN dataset consisting of approximately 12k trajectories on this platform, serving as the first dataset specifically designed for realistic UAV VLN tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.797</span></span>To tackle the challenges posed by complex aerial environments, we propose an assistant-guided UAV object search benchmark called UAV-Need-Help, which provides varying levels of guidance information to help UAVs better accomplish realistic VLN tasks.We also propose a UAV navigation LLM that, given multi-view images, task descriptions, and assistant instructions, leverages the multimodal understanding capabilities of the MLLM to jointly process visual and textual information, and performs hierarchical trajectory generation.The evaluation results of our method significantly outperform the baseline models, while there remains a considerable gap between our results and those achieved by human operators, underscoring the challenge presented by the UAV-Need-Help task.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Model (LLM)-based generative recommendation has achieved notable success, yet its practical deployment is costly particularly due to excessive inference latency caused by autoregressive decoding.For lossless LLM decoding acceleration, Speculative Decoding (SD) has emerged as a promising solution.However, applying SD to generative recommendation presents unique challenges due to the requirement of generating top-K items (i.e., K distinct token sequences) as a recommendation list by beam search.This leads to more stringent verification in SD, where all the top-K sequences from the target LLM must be successfully drafted by the draft model at each decoding step.To alleviate this, we consider 1) boosting top-K sequence alignment between the draft model and the target LLM, and 2) relaxing the verification strategy to reduce trivial LLM calls.To this end, we propose an alignment framework named AtSpeed, which presents the AtSpeed-S optimization objective for top-K alignment under the strict top-K verification.Moreover, we introduce a relaxed sampling verification strategy that allows high-probability non-top-K drafted sequences to be accepted, significantly reducing LLM calls.Correspondingly, we propose AtSpeed-R for top-K alignment under this relaxed sampling verification.Empirical results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that AtSpeed significantly accelerates LLM-based generative recommendation, e.g., near 2x speedup under strict top-K verification and up to 2.5 speedup under relaxed sampling verification.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The codes and datasets will be released in the near future. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.847</span></span></p>

                  <p>To make large language models (LLMs) more helpful across diverse cultures, it is essential to have effective cultural knowledge benchmarks to measure and track our progress.Effective benchmarks need to be robust, diverse, and challenging.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We introduce CulturalBench: a set of 1,227 human-written and human-verified questions for effectively assessing LLMs' cultural knowledge, covering 45 global regions including the underrepresented ones like Bangladesh, Zimbabwe, and Peru. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.757</span></span>Questions - each verified by five independent annotators - span 17 diverse topics ranging from food preferences to greeting etiquettes.We evaluate models on two setups: CulturalBench-Easy and CulturalBench-Hard which share the same questions but asked differently.We find that LLMs are sensitive to such difference in setups (e.g., GPT-4o with 27.3% difference).Compared to human performance (92.6% accuracy), CulturalBench-Hard is more challenging for frontier LLMs with the best performing model (GPT-4o) at only 61.5% and the worst (Llama3-8b) at 21.4%.Moreover, we find that LLMs often struggle with tricky questions that have multiple correct answers (e.g., What utensils do the Chinese usually use?), revealing a tendency to converge to a single answer.Our results also indicate that OpenAI GPT-4o substantially outperform other proprietary and open source models in questions related to all but one region (Oceania).Nonetheless, all models consistently underperform on questions related to South America and the Middle East.</p>

                  <p>Text-rich images, where text serves as the central visual element guiding the overall understanding, are prevalent in real-world applications, such as presentation slides, scanned documents, and webpage snapshots.Tasks involving multiple text-rich images are especially challenging, as they require not only understanding the content of individual images but reasoning about inter-relationships and logical flows across multiple visual inputs.Despite the importance of these scenarios, current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) struggle to handle such tasks due to two key challenges: (1) the scarcity of high-quality instruction tuning datasets for text-rich multi-image scenarios, and (2) the difficulty in balancing image resolution with visual feature sequence length.To address these challenges, we propose \OurMethod, a MLLM designed specifically for handling vision-language tasks involving multiple text-rich images.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>First, we curated about one million high-quality multimodal instruction-tuning data, tailored to text-rich, multi-image scenarios. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.717</span></span>Second, we developed an adaptive high-resolution multi-image encoding module to dynamically optimize the allocation of visual sequence length based on the original aspect ratios and resolutions of the input images.Experiments across a wide range of benchmarks demonstrate our model's superior capabilities in text-rich, multi-image evaluations and competitive performance in general domain evaluations.</p>

                  <p>Remote sensing image plays an irreplaceable role in fields such as agriculture, water resources, military, and disaster relief.Pixel-level interpretation is a critical aspect of remote sensing image applications; however, a prevalent limitation remains the need for extensive manual annotation.For this, we try to introduce open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) into the remote sensing context.However, due to the sensitivity of remote sensing images to low-resolution features, distorted target shapes and ill-fitting boundaries are exhibited in the prediction mask.To tackle this issue, we propose a simple and general upsampler, SimFeatUp, to restore lost spatial information in deep features in a training-free style.Further, based on the observation of the abnormal response of local patch tokens to [CLS] token in CLIP, we propose to execute a straightforward subtraction operation to alleviate the global bias in patch tokens.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments are conducted on 17 remote sensing datasets spanning semantic segmentation, building extraction, road detection, and flood detection tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.718</span></span>Our method achieves an average of 5.8%, 8.2%, 4%, and 15.3% improvement over state-of-the-art methods on 4 tasks.All codes are released.\url{https://earth-insights.github.io/SegEarth-OV}</p>

                  <p>With climate change-related extreme events on the rise, high dimensional Earth observation data presents a unique opportunity for forecasting and understanding impacts on ecosystems.This is, however, impeded by the complexity of processing, visualizing, modeling, and explaining this data.To showcase how this challenge can be met, here we train a convolutional long short-term memory-based architecture on the novel DeepExtremeCubes dataset.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>DeepExtremeCubes includes around 40,000 long-term Sentinel-2 minicubes (January 2016-October 2022) worldwide, along with labeled extreme events, meteorological data, vegetation land cover, and topography map, sampled from locations affected by extreme climate events and surrounding areas. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.781</span></span>When predicting future reflectances and vegetation impacts through kernel normalized difference vegetation index, the model achieved an R$^2$ score of 0.9055 in the test set.Explainable artificial intelligence was used to analyze the model's predictions during the October 2020 Central South America compound heatwave and drought event.We chose the same area exactly one year before the event as counterfactual, finding that the average temperature and surface pressure are generally the best predictors under normal conditions.In contrast, minimum anomalies of evaporation and surface latent heat flux take the lead during the event.A change of regime is also observed in the attributions before the event, which might help assess how long the event was brewing before happening.The code to replicate all experiments and figures in this paper is publicly available at https://github.com/DeepExtremes/txyXAI</p>

                  <p>The stark contrast in the design philosophy of an event camera makes it particularly ideal for operating under high-speed, high dynamic range and low-light conditions, where standard cameras underperform.Nonetheless, event cameras still suffer from some amount of motion blur, especially under these challenging conditions, in contrary to what most think.This is attributed to the limited bandwidth of the event sensor pixel, which is mostly proportional to the light intensity.Thus, to ensure that event cameras can truly excel in such conditions where it has an edge over standard cameras, it is crucial to account for event motion blur in downstream applications, especially reconstruction.However, none of the recent works on reconstructing Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) from events, nor event simulators, have considered the full effects of event motion blur.To this end, we propose, Deblur e-NeRF, a novel method to directly and effectively reconstruct blur-minimal NeRFs from motion-blurred events generated under high-speed motion or low-light conditions.The core component of this work is a physically-accurate pixel bandwidth model proposed to account for event motion blur under arbitrary speed and lighting conditions.We also introduce a novel threshold-normalized total variation loss to improve the regularization of large textureless patches.Experiments on real and novel realistically simulated sequences verify our effectiveness.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code, event simulator and synthetic event dataset will be open-sourced. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.843</span></span></p>

                  <p>Confidence calibration is critical for the safe deployment of machine learning models in the real world.However, such issue in vision-language models like CLIP, particularly after fine-tuning, has not been fully addressed.In this work, we demonstrate that existing prompt tuning methods usually lead to a trade-off of calibration between base and new classes: the cross-entropy loss in CoOp causes overconfidence in new classes by increasing textual label divergence, whereas the regularization of KgCoOp maintains the confidence level but results in underconfidence in base classes due to the improved accuracy.Inspired by the observations, we introduce Dynamic Outlier Regularization (DOR) to ensure the confidence calibration on both base and new classes after fine-tuning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In particular, we propose to minimize the feature deviation of novel textual labels (instead of base classes) sampled from a large vocabulary. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.649</span></span>In effect, DOR prevents the increase in textual divergence for new labels while easing restrictions on base classes.Extensive experiments demonstrate that DOR can enhance the calibration performance of current fine-tuning methods on base and new classes.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) often produce errors, including factual inaccuracies, biases, and reasoning failures, collectively referred to as "hallucinations".Recent studies have demonstrated that LLMs' internal states encode information regarding the truthfulness of their outputs, and that this information can be utilized to detect errors.In this work, we show that the internal representations of LLMs encode much more information about truthfulness than previously recognized.We first discover that the truthfulness information is concentrated in specific tokens, and leveraging this property significantly enhances error detection performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Yet, we show that such error detectors fail to generalize across datasets, implying that -- contrary to prior claims -- truthfulness encoding is not universal but rather multifaceted. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.61</span></span>Next, we show that internal representations can also be used for predicting the types of errors the model is likely to make, facilitating the development of tailored mitigation strategies.Lastly, we reveal a discrepancy between LLMs' internal encoding and external behavior: they may encode the correct answer, yet consistently generate an incorrect one.Taken together, these insights deepen our understanding of LLM errors from the model's internal perspective, which can guide future research on enhancing error analysis and mitigation.</p>

                  <p>The various limitations of Generative AI, such as hallucinations and model failures, have made it crucial to understand the role of different modalities in Visual Language Model (VLM) predictions.Our work investigates how the integration of information from image and text modalities influences the performance and behavior of VLMs in visual question answering (VQA) and reasoning tasks.We measure this effect through answer accuracy, reasoning quality, model uncertainty, and modality relevance.We study the interplay between text and image modalities in different configurations where visual content is essential for solving the VQA task.Our contributions include (1) the Semantic Interventions (SI)-VQA dataset, (2) a benchmark study of various VLM architectures under different modality configurations, and (3) the Interactive Semantic Interventions (ISI) tool.The SI-VQA dataset serves as the foundation for the benchmark, while the ISI tool provides an interface to test and apply semantic interventions in image and text inputs, enabling more fine-grained analysis.Our results show that complementary information between modalities improves answer and reasoning quality, while contradictory information harms model performance and confidence.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Image text annotations have minimal impact on accuracy and uncertainty, slightly increasing image relevance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span>Attention analysis confirms the dominant role of image inputs over text in VQA tasks.In this study, we evaluate state-of-the-art VLMs that allow us to extract attention coefficients for each modality.A key finding is PaliGemma's harmful overconfidence, which poses a higher risk of silent failures compared to the LLaVA models.This work sets the foundation for rigorous analysis of modality integration, supported by datasets specifically designed for this purpose.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) in Software Engineering (SE) can offer assistance for coding.To facilitate a rigorous evaluation of LLMs in practical coding contexts, Carlos et al. introduced the SWE-bench dataset, which comprises 2,294 real-world GitHub issues and their corresponding pull requests, collected from 12 widely used Python repositories.Several impressive LLM-based toolkits recently are developed and evaluated on this dataset.However, a systematic evaluation of the quality of SWE-bench remains missing.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we addressed this gap by presenting an empirical analysis of the SWE-bench dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span>We conducted a manual screening of instances where SWEAgent + GPT-4 successfully resolved issues by comparing the model-generated patches with the actual pull requests.SWE-Agent+GPT-4 was at the top of SWE-bench leaderboard during the time of our study.Our analysis reveals some critical issues with the SWE-bench dataset: 1) 32.67% of the successful patches involve cheating as the solutions were directly provided in the issue report or the comments.We refer to as solution leakage problem.2) 31.08% of the passed patches are suspicious patches due to weak test cases, i.e., the tests were not adequate to verify the correctness of a patch.When we filtered out these problematic issues, the resolution rate of SWE-Agent+GPT-4 dropped from 12.47% to 3.97%.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also observed that the same data quality issues also exist in the two variants of SWE-bench, i.e., SWE-bench Lite and SWE-Bench Verified. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.655</span></span>In addition, over 94% of the issues were created before LLM's knowledge cutoff dates, posing potential data leakage issues.</p>

                  <p>Image retrieval is crucial in robotics and computer vision, with downstream applications in robot place recognition and vision-based product recommendations.Modern retrieval systems face two key challenges: scalability and efficiency.State-of-the-art image retrieval systems train specific neural networks for each dataset, an approach that lacks scalability.Furthermore, since retrieval speed is directly proportional to embedding size, existing systems that use large embeddings lack efficiency.To tackle scalability, recent works propose using off-the-shelf foundation models.However, these models, though applicable across datasets, fall short in achieving performance comparable to that of dataset-specific models.Our key observation is that, while foundation models capture necessary subtleties for effective retrieval, the underlying distribution of their embedding space can negatively impact cosine similarity searches.We introduce Autoencoders with Strong Variance Constraints (AE-SVC), which, when used for projection, significantly improves the performance of foundation models.We provide an in-depth theoretical analysis of AE-SVC.Addressing efficiency, we introduce Single-shot Similarity Space Distillation ((SS)$_2$D), a novel approach to learn embeddings with adaptive sizes that offers a better trade-off between size and performance.We conducted extensive experiments on four retrieval datasets, including Stanford Online Products (SoP) and Pittsburgh30k, using four different off-the-shelf foundation models, including DinoV2 and CLIP.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>AE-SVC demonstrates up to a $16\%$ improvement in retrieval performance, while (SS)$_2$D shows a further $10\%$ improvement for smaller embedding sizes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span></p>

                  <p>Scientific discovery contributes largely to human society's prosperity, and recent progress shows that LLMs could potentially catalyze this process.However, it is still unclear whether LLMs can discover novel and valid hypotheses in chemistry.In this work, we investigate this central research question: Can LLMs automatically discover novel and valid chemistry research hypotheses given only a chemistry research background (consisting of a research question and/or a background survey), without limitation on the domain of the research question?After extensive discussions with chemistry experts, we propose an assumption that a majority of chemistry hypotheses can be resulted from a research background and several inspirations.With this key insight, we break the central question into three smaller fundamental questions.In brief, they are: (1) given a background question, whether LLMs can retrieve good inspirations; (2) with background and inspirations, whether LLMs can lead to hypothesis; and (3) whether LLMs can identify good hypotheses to rank them higher.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To investigate these questions, we construct a benchmark consisting of 51 chemistry papers published in Nature, Science, or a similar level in 2024 (all papers are only available online since 2024). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span>Every paper is divided by chemistry PhD students into three components: background, inspirations, and hypothesis.The goal is to rediscover the hypothesis, given only the background and a large randomly selected chemistry literature corpus consisting the ground truth inspiration papers, with LLMs trained with data up to 2023.We also develop an LLM-based multi-agent framework that leverages the assumption, consisting of three stages reflecting the three smaller questions.The proposed method can rediscover many hypotheses with very high similarity with the ground truth ones, covering the main innovations.</p>

                  <p>Language plays a vital role in the realm of human motion.Existing methods have largely depended on CLIP text embeddings for motion generation, yet they fall short in effectively aligning language and motion due to CLIP's pretraining on static image-text pairs.This work introduces LaMP, a novel Language-Motion Pretraining model, which transitions from a language-vision to a more suitable language-motion latent space.It addresses key limitations by generating motion-informative text embeddings, significantly enhancing the relevance and semantics of generated motion sequences.With LaMP, we advance three key tasks: text-to-motion generation, motion-text retrieval, and motion captioning through aligned language-motion representation learning.For generation, we utilize LaMP to provide the text condition instead of CLIP, and an autoregressive masked prediction is designed to achieve mask modeling without rank collapse in transformers.For retrieval, motion features from LaMP's motion transformer interact with query tokens to retrieve text features from the text transformer, and vice versa.For captioning, we finetune a large language model with the language-informative motion features to develop a strong motion captioning model.In addition, we introduce the LaMP-BertScore metric to assess the alignment of generated motions with textual descriptions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate substantial improvements over previous methods across all three tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span>The code of our method will be made public.</p>

                  <p>Influence functions provide a principled method to assess the contribution of individual training samples to a specific target.Yet, their high computational costs limit their applications on large-scale models and datasets.Existing methods proposed for influence function approximation have significantly reduced the computational overheads.However, they mostly suffer from inaccurate estimation due to the lack of strong convergence guarantees from the algorithm.The family of hyperpower methods are well-known for their rigorous convergence guarantees on matrix inverse approximation, while the matrix multiplication operation can involve intractable memory and computation costs on large-scale models.We propose HyperINF, an efficient and accurate influence function approximation method which leverages the hyperpower method, specifically Schulz's iterative algorithm.   To deal with the computation-intensive matrix multiplication, we incorporate the generalized fisher information (GFIM) as a low-rank approximation of the Hessian matrix, which reduces the memory and computation overheads to constant costs independent of ranks on LoRA-tuned models.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We first demonstrate the superior accuracy and stability of \method compared to other baselines through a synthetic convergence simulation for matrix inversion. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.656</span></span>We further validate the efficacy of \method through extensive real-world data attribution tasks, including mislabeled data detection and data selection for LLM and VLM fine-tuning.   On LoRA-tuned models, HyperINF achieves superior downstream performance with minimal memory and computational overhead, while other baselines suffer from significant degradation.Our codebase is available at https://github.com/Blackzxy/HyperINF.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Model (LLM)-based generative recommendation has achieved notable success, yet its practical deployment is costly particularly due to excessive inference latency caused by autoregressive decoding.For lossless LLM decoding acceleration, Speculative Decoding (SD) has emerged as a promising solution.However, applying SD to generative recommendation presents unique challenges due to the requirement of generating top-K items (i.e., K distinct token sequences) as a recommendation list by beam search.This leads to more stringent verification in SD, where all the top-K sequences from the target LLM must be successfully drafted by the draft model at each decoding step.To alleviate this, we consider 1) boosting top-K sequence alignment between the draft model and the target LLM, and 2) relaxing the verification strategy to reduce trivial LLM calls.To this end, we propose an alignment framework named AtSpeed, which presents the AtSpeed-S optimization objective for top-K alignment under the strict top-K verification.Moreover, we introduce a relaxed sampling verification strategy that allows high-probability non-top-K drafted sequences to be accepted, significantly reducing LLM calls.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Correspondingly, we propose AtSpeed-R for top-K alignment under this relaxed sampling verification. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span>Empirical results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that AtSpeed significantly accelerates LLM-based generative recommendation, e.g., near 2x speedup under strict top-K verification and up to 2.5 speedup under relaxed sampling verification.The codes and datasets will be released in the near future.</p>

                  <p>Cellular automata have become a cornerstone for investigating emergence and self-organization across diverse scientific disciplines, spanning neuroscience, artificial life, and theoretical physics.However, the absence of a hardware-accelerated cellular automata library limits the exploration of new research directions, hinders collaboration, and impedes reproducibility.In this work, we introduce CAX (Cellular Automata Accelerated in JAX), a high-performance and flexible open-source library designed to accelerate cellular automata research.CAX offers cutting-edge performance and a modular design through a user-friendly interface, and can support both discrete and continuous cellular automata with any number of dimensions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We demonstrate CAX's performance and flexibility through a wide range of benchmarks and applications. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span>From classic models like elementary cellular automata and Conway's Game of Life to advanced applications such as growing neural cellular automata and self-classifying MNIST digits, CAX speeds up simulations up to 2,000 times faster.Furthermore, we demonstrate CAX's potential to accelerate research by presenting a collection of three novel cellular automata experiments, each implemented in just a few lines of code thanks to the library's modular architecture.Notably, we show that a simple one-dimensional cellular automaton can outperform GPT-4 on the 1D-ARC challenge.</p>

                  <p>There have been many benchmarks for evaluating long-context language models (LCLMs), but developers often rely on synthetic tasks like needle-in-a-haystack (NIAH) or arbitrary subsets of tasks.It remains unclear whether they translate to the diverse downstream applications of LCLMs, and the inconsistency further complicates model comparison.We investigate the underlying reasons behind current practices and find that existing benchmarks often provide noisy signals due to low coverage of applications, insufficient lengths, unreliable metrics, and incompatibility with base models.In this work, we present HELMET (How to Evaluate Long-context Models Effectively and Thoroughly), a comprehensive benchmark encompassing seven diverse, application-centric categories.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also address many issues in previous benchmarks by adding controllable lengths up to 128k tokens, model-based evaluation for reliable metrics, and few-shot prompting for robustly evaluating base models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span>Consequently, we demonstrate that HELMET offers more reliable and consistent rankings of frontier LCLMs.Through a comprehensive study of 51 LCLMs, we find that (1) synthetic tasks like NIAH are not good predictors of downstream performance; (2) the diverse categories in HELMET exhibit distinct trends and low correlation with each other; and (3) while most LCLMs achieve perfect NIAH scores, open-source models significantly lag behind closed ones when the task requires full-context reasoning or following complex instructions -- the gap widens with increased lengths.Finally, we recommend using our RAG tasks for fast model development, as they are easy to run and more predictive of other downstream performance; ultimately, we advocate for a holistic evaluation across diverse tasks.</p>

                  <p>Software engineers mainly write code by editing existing programs.In contrast, large language models (LLMs) autoregressively synthesize programs in a single pass.One explanation for this is the scarcity of open-sourced edit data.While high-quality instruction data for code synthesis is already scarce, high-quality edit data is even scarcer.To fill this gap, we develop a synthetic data generation algorithm called LintSeq.This algorithm refactors existing code into a sequence of code edits by using a linter to procedurally sample across the error-free insertions that can be used to sequentially write programs.It outputs edit sequences as text strings consisting of consecutive program diffs.To test LintSeq, we use it to refactor a dataset of instruction + program pairs into instruction + program-diff-sequence tuples.Then, we instruction finetune a series of smaller LLMs ranging from 2.6B to 14B parameters on both the re-factored and original versions of this dataset, comparing zero-shot performance on code synthesis benchmarks.We show that during repeated sampling, edit sequence finetuned models produce more diverse programs than baselines.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This results in better inference-time scaling for benchmark coverage as a function of samples, i.e. the fraction of problems "pass@k" solved by any attempt given "k" tries. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.63</span></span>For example, on HumanEval pass@50, small LLMs finetuned on synthetic edit sequences are competitive with GPT-4 and outperform models finetuned on the baseline dataset by +20% (+/-3%) in absolute score.Finally, we also pretrain our own tiny LMs for code understanding.We show that finetuning tiny models on synthetic code edits results in state-of-the-art code synthesis for the on-device model class.Our 150M parameter edit sequence LM matches or outperforms code models with twice as many parameters, both with and without repeated sampling, including Codex and AlphaCode.</p>

Here we present a GROMACS implementation of a rigorous Hamiltonian interpolation $\lambda$-dynamics constant pH method, which rests on GPU-accelerated Fast Multipole Method (FMM) electrostatics.Our implementation supports both CHARMM36m and Amber99sb*-ILDN force fields and is largely automated to enable seamless switching from regular MD to constant pH MD, involving minimal changes to the input files.Here, the first of two companion papers describes the underlying constant pH protocol and sample applications to several prototypical benchmark systems such as cardiotoxin V, lysozyme, and staphylococcal nuclease.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Enhanced convergence is achieved through a new dynamic barrier height optimization method, and high p$K_a$ accuracy is demonstrated. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.654</span></span>We use Functional Mode Analysis and Mutual Information to explore the complex intra- and intermolecular couplings between the protonation states of titratable groups as well as those between protonation states and conformational dynamics.We identify striking conformation-dependent p$K_a$ variations and unexpected inter-residue couplings.Conformation-protonation coupling is identified as a primary cause of the slow protonation convergence notorious to constant pH simulations involving multiple titratable groups, suggesting enhanced sampling methods to accelerate convergence.</p>

                  <p>Text-rich images, where text serves as the central visual element guiding the overall understanding, are prevalent in real-world applications, such as presentation slides, scanned documents, and webpage snapshots.Tasks involving multiple text-rich images are especially challenging, as they require not only understanding the content of individual images but reasoning about inter-relationships and logical flows across multiple visual inputs.Despite the importance of these scenarios, current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) struggle to handle such tasks due to two key challenges: (1) the scarcity of high-quality instruction tuning datasets for text-rich multi-image scenarios, and (2) the difficulty in balancing image resolution with visual feature sequence length.To address these challenges, we propose \OurMethod, a MLLM designed specifically for handling vision-language tasks involving multiple text-rich images.First, we curated about one million high-quality multimodal instruction-tuning data, tailored to text-rich, multi-image scenarios.Second, we developed an adaptive high-resolution multi-image encoding module to dynamically optimize the allocation of visual sequence length based on the original aspect ratios and resolutions of the input images.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments across a wide range of benchmarks demonstrate our model's superior capabilities in text-rich, multi-image evaluations and competitive performance in general domain evaluations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.617</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in diffusion models have led to significant improvements in the generation and animation of 4D full-body human-object interactions (HOI).Nevertheless, existing methods primarily focus on SMPL-based motion generation, which is limited by the scarcity of realistic large-scale interaction data.This constraint affects their ability to create everyday HOI scenes.This paper addresses this challenge using a zero-shot approach with a pre-trained diffusion model.Despite this potential, achieving our goals is difficult due to the diffusion model's lack of understanding of ''where'' and ''how'' objects interact with the human body.To tackle these issues, we introduce AvatarGO, a novel framework designed to generate animatable 4D HOI scenes directly from textual inputs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, 1) for the ''where'' challenge, we propose LLM-guided contact retargeting, which employs Lang-SAM to identify the contact body part from text prompts, ensuring precise representation of human-object spatial relations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.608</span></span>2) For the ''how'' challenge, we introduce correspondence-aware motion optimization that constructs motion fields for both human and object models using the linear blend skinning function from SMPL-X. Our framework not only generates coherent compositional motions, but also exhibits greater robustness in handling penetration issues.Extensive experiments with existing methods validate AvatarGO's superior generation and animation capabilities on a variety of human-object pairs and diverse poses.As the first attempt to synthesize 4D avatars with object interactions, we hope AvatarGO could open new doors for human-centric 4D content creation.</p>

                  <p>The availability of performant pre-trained models has led to a proliferation of fine-tuned expert models that are specialized to particular domains.This has enabled the creation of powerful and adaptive routing-based "Model MoErging" methods with the goal of using expert modules to create an aggregate system with improved performance or generalization.However, existing MoErging methods often prioritize generalization to unseen tasks at the expense of performance on held-in tasks, which limits its practical applicability in real-world deployment scenarios.We observe that current token-level routing mechanisms neglect the global semantic context of the input task.This token-wise independence hinders effective expert selection for held-in tasks, as routing decisions fail to incorporate the semantic properties of the task.To address this, we propose, Global and Local Instruction Driven Expert Router (GLIDER) that integrates a multi-scale routing mechanism, encompassing a semantic global router and a learned local router.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The global router leverages LLM's advanced reasoning capabilities for semantic-related contexts to enhance expert selection. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.681</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Given the input query and LLM, the router generates semantic task instructions that guide the retrieval of the most relevant experts across all layers. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.656</span></span>This global guidance is complemented by a local router that facilitates token-level routing decisions within each module, enabling finer control and enhanced performance on unseen tasks.Our experiments using T5-based models for T0 and FLAN tasks demonstrate that GLIDER achieves substantially improved held-in performance while maintaining strong generalization on held-out tasks.We also perform ablations experiments to dive deeper into the components of GLIDER.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experiments highlight the importance of our multi-scale routing that leverages LLM-driven semantic reasoning for MoErging methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.693</span></span></p>
