                  <p>Gender-fair language, an evolving German linguistic variation, fosters inclusion by addressing all genders or using neutral forms.Nevertheless, there is a significant lack of resources to assess the impact of this linguistic shift on classification using language models (LMs), which are probably not trained on such variations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this gap, we present Lou, the first dataset featuring high-quality reformulations for German text classification covering seven tasks, like stance detection and toxicity classification. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.725</span></span>Evaluating 16 mono- and multi-lingual LMs on Lou shows that gender-fair language substantially impacts predictions by flipping labels, reducing certainty, and altering attention patterns.However, existing evaluations remain valid, as LM rankings of original and reformulated instances do not significantly differ.While we offer initial insights on the effect on German text classification, the findings likely apply to other languages, as consistent patterns were observed in multi-lingual and English LMs.</p>

                  <p>The stark contrast in the design philosophy of an event camera makes it particularly ideal for operating under high-speed, high dynamic range and low-light conditions, where standard cameras underperform.Nonetheless, event cameras still suffer from some amount of motion blur, especially under these challenging conditions, in contrary to what most think.This is attributed to the limited bandwidth of the event sensor pixel, which is mostly proportional to the light intensity.Thus, to ensure that event cameras can truly excel in such conditions where it has an edge over standard cameras, it is crucial to account for event motion blur in downstream applications, especially reconstruction.However, none of the recent works on reconstructing Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) from events, nor event simulators, have considered the full effects of event motion blur.To this end, we propose, Deblur e-NeRF, a novel method to directly and effectively reconstruct blur-minimal NeRFs from motion-blurred events generated under high-speed motion or low-light conditions.The core component of this work is a physically-accurate pixel bandwidth model proposed to account for event motion blur under arbitrary speed and lighting conditions.We also introduce a novel threshold-normalized total variation loss to improve the regularization of large textureless patches.Experiments on real and novel realistically simulated sequences verify our effectiveness.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code, event simulator and synthetic event dataset will be open-sourced. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.843</span></span></p>

                  <p>Event cameras are bio-inspired sensors that capture the intensity changes asynchronously and output event streams with distinct advantages, such as high temporal resolution.To exploit event cameras for object/action recognition, existing methods predominantly sample and aggregate events in a second-level duration at every fixed temporal interval (or frequency).However, they often face difficulties in capturing the spatiotemporal relationships for longer, e.g., minute-level, events and generalizing across varying temporal frequencies.To fill the gap, we present a novel framework, dubbed PAST-SSM, exhibiting superior capacity in recognizing events with arbitrary duration (e.g., 0.1s to 4.5s) and generalizing to varying inference frequencies.Our key insight is to learn the spatiotemporal relationships from the encoded event features via the state space model (SSM) -- whose linear complexity makes it ideal for modeling high temporal resolution events with longer sequences.To achieve this goal, we first propose a Path-Adaptive Event Aggregation and Scan (PEAS) module to encode events of varying duration into features with fixed dimensions by adaptively scanning and selecting aggregated event frames.On top of PEAS, we introduce a novel Multi-faceted Selection Guiding (MSG) loss to minimize the randomness and redundancy of the encoded features.This subtly enhances the model generalization across different inference frequencies.Lastly, the SSM is employed to better learn the spatiotemporal properties from the encoded features.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, we build a minute-level event-based recognition dataset, named ArDVS100, with arbitrary duration for the benefit of the community. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.778</span></span>Extensive experiments prove that our method outperforms prior arts by +3.45%, +0.38% and +8.31% on the DVS Action, SeAct and HARDVS datasets, respectively.</p>

                  <p>Event cameras are innovative neuromorphic sensors that asynchronously capture the scene dynamics.Due to the event-triggering mechanism, such cameras record event streams with much shorter response latency and higher intensity sensitivity compared to conventional cameras.On the basis of these features, previous works have attempted to reconstruct high dynamic range (HDR) videos from events, but have either suffered from unrealistic artifacts or failed to provide sufficiently high frame rates.In this paper, we present a recurrent convolutional neural network that reconstruct high-speed HDR videos from event sequences, with a key frame guidance to prevent potential error accumulation caused by the sparse event data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, to address the problem of severely limited real dataset, we develop a new optical system to collect a real-world dataset with paired high-speed HDR videos and event streams, facilitating future research in this field. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.704</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our dataset provides the first real paired dataset for event-to-HDR reconstruction, avoiding potential inaccuracies from simulation strategies. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.708</span></span>Experimental results demonstrate that our method can generate high-quality, high-speed HDR videos.We further explore the potential of our work in cross-camera reconstruction and downstream computer vision tasks, including object detection, panoramic segmentation, optical flow estimation, and monocular depth estimation under HDR scenarios.</p>

                  <p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) are powerful for cognitive tasks such as image classification, object detection, and scene segmentation.One drawback however is the significant high computational complexity and memory consumption, which makes them unfeasible to run real-time on embedded platforms because of the limited hardware resources.Block floating point (BFP) quantization is one of the representative compression approaches for reducing the memory and computational burden owing to their capability to effectively capture the broad data distribution of DNN models.Unfortunately, prior works on BFP-based quantization empirically choose the block size and the precision that preserve accuracy.In this paper, we develop a BFP-based bitwidth-aware analytical modeling framework (called ``BitQ'') for the best BFP implementation of DNN inference on embedded platforms.We formulate and resolve an optimization problem to identify the optimal BFP block size and bitwidth distribution by the trade-off of both accuracy and performance loss.Experimental results show that compared with an equal bitwidth setting, the BFP DNNs with optimized bitwidth allocation provide efficient computation, preserving accuracy on famous benchmarks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The source code and data are available at https://github.com/Cheliosoops/BitQ. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.796</span></span></p>

                  <p>Today's most advanced multimodal models remain proprietary.The strongest open-weight models rely heavily on synthetic data from proprietary VLMs to achieve good performance, effectively distilling these closed models into open ones.As a result, the community is still missing foundational knowledge about how to build performant VLMs from scratch.We present Molmo, a new family of VLMs that are state-of-the-art in their class of openness.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our key innovation is a novel, highly detailed image caption dataset collected entirely from human annotators using speech-based descriptions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.753</span></span>To enable a wide array of user interactions, we also introduce a diverse dataset mixture for fine-tuning that includes in-the-wild Q&A and innovative 2D pointing data.The success of our approach relies on careful choices for the model architecture details, a well-tuned training pipeline, and, most critically, the quality of our newly collected datasets, all of which will be released.The best-in-class 72B model within the Molmo family not only outperforms others in the class of open weight and data models but also compares favorably against proprietary systems like GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, and Gemini 1.5 on both academic benchmarks and human evaluation.   We will be releasing all of our model weights, captioning and fine-tuning data, and source code in the near future.Select model weights, inference code, and demo are available at https://molmo.allenai.org.</p>

Estimation of coverage rates of spray deposition in a class-wise manner allows for further understanding of effectiveness of precision spraying systems.Our study evaluates different Class Activation Mapping techniques, namely AblationCAM and ScoreCAM, to determine which is more effective and interpretable for these tasks.In the pipeline, inference-only feature fusion is used to allow for further interpretability and to enable the automation of precision spraying evaluation post-spray.Our findings indicate that a Fully Convolutional Network with an EfficientNet-B0 backbone and inference-only feature fusion achieves an average absolute difference in deposition values of 156.8 {\mu}L across three classes in our test set.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset curated in this paper is publicly available at https://github.com/Harry-Rogers/PSIE <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.804</span></span></p>

                  <p>Open-vocabulary panoptic segmentation is an emerging task aiming to accurately segment the image into semantically meaningful masks based on a set of texts.Despite existing efforts, it remains challenging to develop a high-performing method that generalizes effectively across new domains and requires minimal training resources.Our in-depth analysis of current methods reveals a crucial insight: mask classification is the main performance bottleneck for open-vocab.panoptic segmentation.Based on this, we propose Semantic Refocused Tuning (SMART), a novel framework that greatly enhances open-vocab.panoptic segmentation by improving mask classification through two key innovations.First, SMART adopts a multimodal Semantic-guided Mask Attention mechanism that injects task-awareness into the regional information extraction process.This enables the model to capture task-specific and contextually relevant information for more effective mask classification.Second, it incorporates Query Projection Tuning, which strategically fine-tunes the query projection layers within the Vision Language Model (VLM) used for mask classification.This adjustment allows the model to adapt the image focus of mask tokens to new distributions with minimal training resources, while preserving the VLM's pre-trained knowledge.Extensive ablation studies confirm the superiority of our approach.Notably, SMART sets new state-of-the-art results, demonstrating improvements of up to +1.3 PQ and +5.4 mIoU across representative benchmarks, while reducing training costs by nearly 10x compared to the previous best method.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and data will be released. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.89</span></span></p>

While compression algorithms and search algorithms do exist independently, few algorithms offer both, and those which do are domain-specific.   We present panCAKES, a novel approach to compressive search, i.e., a way to perform $k$-NN and $\rho$-NN search on compressed data while only decompressing a small, relevant, portion of the data.   panCAKES assumes the manifold hypothesis and leverages the low-dimensional structure of the data to compress and search it efficiently.   panCAKES is generic over any distance function for which the distance between two points is proportional to the memory cost of storing an encoding of one in terms of the other.   This property holds for many widely-used distance functions, e.g. string edit distances (Levenshtein, Needleman-Wunsch, etc.) and set dissimilarity measures (Jaccard, Dice, etc.).   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We benchmark panCAKES on a variety of datasets, including genomic, proteomic, and set data.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.768</span></span>We compare compression ratios to gzip, and search performance between the compressed and uncompressed versions of the same dataset.   panCAKES achieves compression ratios close to those of gzip, while offering sub-linear time performance for $k$-NN and $\rho$-NN search.

We provide an open-source implementation of panCAKES in the Rust programming language.</p>

                  <p>As the number of service robots and autonomous vehicles in human-centered environments grows, their requirements go beyond simply navigating to a destination.They must also take into account dynamic social contexts and ensure respect and comfort for others in shared spaces, which poses significant challenges for perception and planning.In this paper, we present a group-based social navigation framework GSON to enable mobile robots to perceive and exploit the social group of their surroundings by leveling the visual reasoning capability of the Large Multimodal Model (LMM).For perception, we apply visual prompting techniques to zero-shot extract the social relationship among pedestrians and combine the result with a robust pedestrian detection and tracking pipeline to alleviate the problem of low inference speed of the LMM.Given the perception result, the planning system is designed to avoid disrupting the current social structure.We adopt a social structure-based mid-level planner as a bridge between global path planning and local motion planning to preserve the global context and reactive response.The proposed method is validated on real-world mobile robot navigation tasks involving complex social structure understanding and reasoning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the system in these scenarios compared with several baselines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.646</span></span></p>

                  <p>Self-supervised pretraining (SSP) has shown promising results in learning from large unlabeled datasets and, thus, could be useful for automated cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) short-axis cine segmentation.However, inconsistent reports of the benefits of SSP for segmentation have made it difficult to apply SSP to CMR.Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate SSP methods for CMR cine segmentation.   To this end, short-axis cine stacks of 296 subjects (90618 2D slices) were used for unlabeled pretraining with four SSP methods; SimCLR, positional contrastive learning, DINO, and masked image modeling (MIM).Subsets of varying numbers of subjects were used for supervised fine-tuning of 2D models for each SSP method, as well as to train a 2D baseline model from scratch.The fine-tuned models were compared to the baseline using the 3D Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) in a test dataset of 140 subjects.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The SSP methods showed no performance gains with the largest supervised fine-tuning subset compared to the baseline (DSC = 0.89). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span>When only 10 subjects (231 2D slices) are available for supervised training, SSP using MIM (DSC = 0.86) improves over training from scratch (DSC = 0.82).   This study found that SSP is valuable for CMR cine segmentation when labeled training data is scarce, but does not aid state-of-the-art deep learning methods when ample labeled data is available.Moreover, the choice of SSP method is important.The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/q-cardIA/ssp-cmr-cine-segmentation</p>

                  <p>There is a class of entropy-coding methods which do not substitute symbols by code words (such as Huffman coding), but operate on intervals or ranges.This class includes three prominent members: conventional arithmetic coding, range coding, and coding based on asymmetric numeral systems.To determine the correct symbol in the decoder, each of these methods requires the comparison of a state variable with subinterval boundaries.In adaptive operation, considering varying symbol statistics, an array of interval boundaries must additionally be kept up to date.The larger the symbol alphabet, the more time-consuming both the search for the correct subinterval and the updating of interval borders become.   Detailed pseudo-code is used to discuss different approaches to speed up the symbol search in the decoder and the adaptation of the array of interval borders, both depending on the chosen alphabet size.It is shown that reducing the $\mathcal{O}$-complexity does not lead to an acceleration in practical implementations if the alphabet size is too small.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In adaptive compression mode, the binary indexing method proves to be superior when considering the overall processing time. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.646</span></span>Although the symbol search (in the decoder) takes longer than with other algorithms, the faster updating of the array of interval borders more than compensates for this disadvantage.A variant of the binary indexing method is proposed, which is more flexible and has a partially lower complexity than the original approach.</p>

                  <p>Referring Image Segmentation (RIS), aims to segment the object referred by a given sentence in an image by understanding both visual and linguistic information.However, existing RIS methods tend to explore top-performance models, disregarding considerations for practical applications on resources-limited edge devices.This oversight poses a significant challenge for on-device RIS inference.To this end, we propose an effective and efficient post-training quantization framework termed PTQ4RIS.Specifically, we first conduct an in-depth analysis of the root causes of performance degradation in RIS model quantization and propose dual-region quantization (DRQ) and reorder-based outlier-retained quantization (RORQ) to address the quantization difficulties in visual and text encoders.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on three benchmarks with different bits settings (from 8 to 4 bits) demonstrates its superior performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.674</span></span>Importantly, we are the first PTQ method specifically designed for the RIS task, highlighting the feasibility of PTQ in RIS applications.Code will be available at {https://github.com/gugu511yy/PTQ4RIS}.</p>

                  <p>Nowadays, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are commonly used in search and rescue scenarios to gather information in the search area.The automatic identification of the person searched for in aerial footage could increase the autonomy of such systems, reduce the search time, and thus increase the missed person's chances of survival.In this paper, we present a novel approach to perform semantically conditioned open vocabulary object tracking that is specifically designed to cope with the limitations of UAV hardware.Our approach has several advantages.It can run with verbal descriptions of the missing person, e.g., the color of the shirt, it does not require dedicated training to execute the mission and can efficiently track a potentially moving person.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experimental results demonstrate the versatility and efficacy of our approach. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.626</span></span></p>

                  <p>To mitigate risks from AI systems, we need to assess their capabilities accurately.This is especially difficult in cases where capabilities are only rarely displayed.Phuong et al. propose two methods that aim to obtain better estimates of the probability of an AI agent successfully completing a given task.The milestone method decomposes tasks into subtasks, aiming to improve overall success rate estimation, while the expert best-of-N method leverages human guidance as a proxy for the model's independent performance.   Our analysis of these methods as Monte Carlo estimators reveals that while both effectively reduce variance compared to naive Monte Carlo sampling, they also introduce bias.Experimental results demonstrate that the milestone method underestimates true solve rates for many real-world tasks due to its constraining assumptions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The expert best-of-N method exhibits even more severe underestimation across all tasks, attributed to an inherently flawed re-weighting factor. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span>To enhance the accuracy of capability estimates of AI agents on difficult tasks, we suggest future work should leverage the rich literature on Monte Carlo Estimators.</p>

                  <p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a popular solution to mitigate the hallucination issues of large language models.However, existing studies on RAG seldom address the issue of predictive uncertainty, i.e., how likely it is that a RAG model's prediction is incorrect, resulting in uncontrollable risks in real-world applications.In this work, we emphasize the importance of risk control, ensuring that RAG models proactively refuse to answer questions with low confidence.Our research identifies two critical latent factors affecting RAG's confidence in its predictions: the quality of the retrieved results and the manner in which these results are utilized.To guide RAG models in assessing their own confidence based on these two latent factors, we develop a counterfactual prompting framework that induces the models to alter these factors and analyzes the effect on their answers.We also introduce a benchmarking procedure to collect answers with the option to abstain, facilitating a series of experiments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For evaluation, we introduce several risk-related metrics and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span></p>

                  <p>Character video synthesis aims to produce realistic videos of animatable characters within lifelike scenes.As a fundamental problem in the computer vision and graphics community, 3D works typically require multi-view captures for per-case training, which severely limits their applicability of modeling arbitrary characters in a short time.Recent 2D methods break this limitation via pre-trained diffusion models, but they struggle for pose generality and scene interaction.To this end, we propose MIMO, a novel framework which can not only synthesize character videos with controllable attributes (i.e., character, motion and scene) provided by simple user inputs, but also simultaneously achieve advanced scalability to arbitrary characters, generality to novel 3D motions, and applicability to interactive real-world scenes in a unified framework.The core idea is to encode the 2D video to compact spatial codes, considering the inherent 3D nature of video occurrence.Concretely, we lift the 2D frame pixels into 3D using monocular depth estimators, and decompose the video clip to three spatial components (i.e., main human, underlying scene, and floating occlusion) in hierarchical layers based on the 3D depth.These components are further encoded to canonical identity code, structured motion code and full scene code, which are utilized as control signals of synthesis process.The design of spatial decomposed modeling enables flexible user control, complex motion expression, as well as 3D-aware synthesis for scene interactions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results demonstrate effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.754</span></span></p>

                  <p>Fine-tuning is arguably the most straightforward way to tailor a pre-trained model (e.g., a foundation model) to downstream applications, but it also comes with the risk of losing valuable knowledge the model had learned in pre-training.For example, fine-tuning a pre-trained classifier capable of recognizing a large number of classes to master a subset of classes at hand is shown to drastically degrade the model's accuracy in the other classes it had previously learned.As such, it is hard to further use the fine-tuned model when it encounters classes beyond the fine-tuning data.In this paper, we systematically dissect the issue, aiming to answer the fundamental question, ''What has been damaged in the fine-tuned model?''To our surprise, we find that the fine-tuned model neither forgets the relationship among the other classes nor degrades the features to recognize these classes.Instead, the fine-tuned model often produces more discriminative features for these other classes, even if they were missing during fine-tuning!{What really hurts the accuracy is the discrepant logit scales between the fine-tuning classes and the other classes}, implying that a simple post-processing calibration would bring back the pre-trained model's capability and at the same time unveil the feature improvement over all classes.We conduct an extensive empirical study to demonstrate the robustness of our findings and provide preliminary explanations underlying them, suggesting new directions for future theoretical analysis.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code is available at https://github.com/OSU-MLB/Fine-Tuning-Is-Fine-If-Calibrated. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.619</span></span></p>

                  <p>Robotic assistive feeding holds significant promise for improving the quality of life for individuals with eating disabilities.However, acquiring diverse food items under varying conditions and generalizing to unseen food presents unique challenges.Existing methods that rely on surface-level geometric information (e.g., bounding box and pose) derived from visual cues (e.g., color, shape, and texture) often lacks adaptability and robustness, especially when foods share similar physical properties but differ in visual appearance.We employ imitation learning (IL) to learn a policy for food acquisition.Existing methods employ IL or Reinforcement Learning (RL) to learn a policy based on off-the-shelf image encoders such as ResNet-50.However, such representations are not robust and struggle to generalize across diverse acquisition scenarios.To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach, IMRL (Integrated Multi-Dimensional Representation Learning), which integrates visual, physical, temporal, and geometric representations to enhance the robustness and generalizability of IL for food acquisition.Our approach captures food types and physical properties (e.g., solid, semi-solid, granular, liquid, and mixture), models temporal dynamics of acquisition actions, and introduces geometric information to determine optimal scooping points and assess bowl fullness.IMRL enables IL to adaptively adjust scooping strategies based on context, improving the robot's capability to handle diverse food acquisition scenarios.Experiments on a real robot demonstrate our approach's robustness and adaptability across various foods and bowl configurations, including zero-shot generalization to unseen settings.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our approach achieves improvement up to $35\%$ in success rate compared with the best-performing baseline. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.714</span></span></p>

                  <p>Federated learning offers a paradigm to the challenge of preserving privacy in distributed machine learning.However, datasets distributed across each client in the real world are inevitably heterogeneous, and if the datasets can be globally aggregated, they tend to be long-tailed distributed, which greatly affects the performance of the model.The traditional approach to federated learning primarily addresses the heterogeneity of data among clients, yet it fails to address the phenomenon of class-wise bias in global long-tailed data.This results in the trained model focusing on the head classes while neglecting the equally important tail classes.Consequently, it is essential to develop a methodology that considers classes holistically.To address the above problems, we propose a new method FedLF, which introduces three modifications in the local training phase: adaptive logit adjustment, continuous class centred optimization, and feature decorrelation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We compare seven state-of-the-art methods with varying degrees of data heterogeneity and long-tailed distribution. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.642</span></span>Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets CIFAR-10-LT and CIFAR-100-LT demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates the problem of model performance degradation due to data heterogeneity and long-tailed distribution.our code is available at https://github.com/18sym/FedLF.</p>

                  <p>An unprecedented amount of existing functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data provides a new opportunity to understand the relationship between functional fluctuation and human cognition/behavior using a data-driven approach.To that end, tremendous efforts have been made in machine learning to predict cognitive states from evolving volumetric images of blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals.Due to the complex nature of brain function, however, the evaluation on learning performance and discoveries are not often consistent across current state-of-the-arts (SOTA).By capitalizing on large-scale existing neuroimaging data (34,887 data samples from six public databases), we seek to establish a well-founded empirical guideline for designing deep models for functional neuroimages by linking the methodology underpinning with knowledge from the neuroscience domain.Specifically, we put the spotlight on (1) What is the current SOTA performance in cognitive task recognition and disease diagnosis using fMRI?(2) What are the limitations of current deep models?and (3) What is the general guideline for selecting the suitable machine learning backbone for new neuroimaging applications?<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We have conducted a comprehensive evaluation and statistical analysis, in various settings, to answer the above outstanding questions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span></p>

                  <p>The variety of today's multicore architectures motivates researchers to explore parallel scientific applications on different platforms.Load imbalance is one performance issue that can prejudice parallel applications from exploiting the computational power of these platforms.Ondes3D is a scientific application for seismic wave simulation used to assess the geological impact of earthquakes.Its parallelism relies on applying a regular domain decomposition in the geological domain provided and distributing each sub-domain to MPI ranks.Previous works investigate the significant spatial and temporal imbalance in Ondes3D and suggest new parallelization and load balancing techniques to minimize them.However, none explored its execution on different architectures.Our paper evaluates the performance of Ondes3D for two earthquake scenarios on eight different multicore architectures, including Intel, AMD, and ARM processors.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We measure the load distribution per MPI rank, evaluate the temporal load imbalance, and compare the execution of the application's kernels. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span>Our results show that the temporal load imbalance in Ondes3D depends on the architecture chosen, with some platforms minimizing such imbalance more effectively.</p>

                  <p>Tourism Recommender Systems (TRS) have traditionally focused on providing personalized travel suggestions, often prioritizing user preferences without considering broader sustainability goals.Integrating sustainability into TRS has become essential with the increasing need to balance environmental impact, local community interests, and visitor satisfaction.This paper proposes a novel approach to enhancing TRS for sustainable city trips using Large Language Models (LLMs) and a modified Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline.We enhance the traditional RAG system by incorporating a sustainability metric based on a city's popularity and seasonal demand during the prompt augmentation phase.This modification, called Sustainability Augmented Reranking (SAR), ensures the system's recommendations align with sustainability goals.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Evaluations using popular open-source LLMs, such as Llama-3.1-Instruct-8B and Mistral-Instruct-7B, demonstrate that the SAR-enhanced approach consistently matches or outperforms the baseline (without SAR) across most metrics, highlighting the benefits of incorporating sustainability into TRS. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.645</span></span></p>

Methodology:We conducted an exploratory interview study of RIA in three large enterprises.We focused on how they conduct RIA, emphasizing cross-functional interactions, and using the EAA as an example.   Results: RIA, as a regulatory RE process, is conducted to address the needs of executive management and central functions.It involves coordination between different functions and levels of enterprise hierarchy.Enterprises use artifacts to support interpretation and communication of the results of RIA.Challenges to RIA are mainly related to the execution of such coordination and managing the knowledge involved.   Conclusion: RIA in large enterprises demands close coordination of multiple stakeholders and roles.Applying interpretation and compliance artifacts is one approach to support such coordination.However, there are no established practices for creating and managing such artifacts.</p>

                A Novel Idea Generation Tool using a Structured Conversational AI (CAI) System
