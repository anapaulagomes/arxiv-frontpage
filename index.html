                  <p>We propose a real-time dynamic LiDAR odometry pipeline for mobile robots in Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) scenarios.Existing approaches to dynamic object detection often rely on pretrained learned networks or computationally expensive volumetric maps.To enhance efficiency on computationally limited robots, we reuse data between the odometry and detection module.Utilizing a range image segmentation technique and a novel residual-based heuristic, our method distinguishes dynamic from static objects before integrating them into the point cloud map.The approach demonstrates robust object tracking and improved map accuracy in environments with numerous dynamic objects.Even highly non-rigid objects, such as running humans, are accurately detected at point level without prior downsampling of the point cloud and hence, without loss of information.Evaluation on simulated and real-world data validates its computational efficiency.Compared to a state-of-the-art volumetric method, our approach shows comparable detection performance at a fraction of the processing time, adding only 14 ms to the odometry module for dynamic object detection and tracking.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The implementation and a new real-world dataset are available as open-source for further research. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.78</span></span></p>

                  <p>Visual Language Navigation is a task that challenges robots to navigate in realistic environments based on natural language instructions.While previous research has largely focused on static settings, real-world navigation must often contend with dynamic human obstacles.Hence, we propose an extension to the task, termed Adaptive Visual Language Navigation (AdaVLN), which seeks to narrow this gap.AdaVLN requires robots to navigate complex 3D indoor environments populated with dynamically moving human obstacles, adding a layer of complexity to navigation tasks that mimic the real-world.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To support exploration of this task, we also present AdaVLN simulator and AdaR2R datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.72</span></span>The AdaVLN simulator enables easy inclusion of fully animated human models directly into common datasets like Matterport3D.We also introduce a "freeze-time" mechanism for both the navigation task and simulator, which pauses world state updates during agent inference, enabling fair comparisons and experimental reproducibility across different hardware.We evaluate several baseline models on this task, analyze the unique challenges introduced by AdaVLN, and demonstrate its potential to bridge the sim-to-real gap in VLN research.</p>

We extend this trend to the video domain applying it to the task of action recognition.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Employing fractal geometry, we present methods to automatically produce large-scale datasets of short synthetic video clips, which can be utilized for pre-training neural models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.733</span></span>The generated video clips are characterized by notable variety, stemmed by the innate ability of fractals to generate complex multi-scale structures.To narrow the domain gap, we further identify key properties of real videos and carefully emulate them during pre-training.Through thorough ablations, we determine the attributes that strengthen downstream results and offer general guidelines for pre-training with synthetic videos.The proposed approach is evaluated by fine-tuning pre-trained models on established action recognition datasets HMDB51 and UCF101 as well as four other video benchmarks related to group action recognition, fine-grained action recognition and dynamic scenes.Compared to standard Kinetics pre-training, our reported results come close and are even superior on a portion of downstream datasets.Code and samples of synthetic videos are available at https://github.com/davidsvy/fractal_video .</p>

                  <p>AI-driven video generation techniques have made significant progress in recent years.However, AI-generated videos (AGVs) involving human activities often exhibit substantial visual and semantic distortions, hindering the practical application of video generation technologies in real-world scenarios.To address this challenge, we conduct a pioneering study on human activity AGV quality assessment, focusing on visual quality evaluation and the identification of semantic distortions.First, we construct the AI-Generated Human activity Video Quality Assessment (Human-AGVQA) dataset, consisting of 3,200 AGVs derived from 8 popular text-to-video (T2V) models using 400 text prompts that describe diverse human activities.We conduct a subjective study to evaluate the human appearance quality, action continuity quality, and overall video quality of AGVs, and identify semantic issues of human body parts.Based on Human-AGVQA, we benchmark the performance of T2V models and analyze their strengths and weaknesses in generating different categories of human activities.Second, we develop an objective evaluation metric, named AI-Generated Human activity Video Quality metric (GHVQ), to automatically analyze the quality of human activity AGVs.GHVQ systematically extracts human-focused quality features, AI-generated content-aware quality features, and temporal continuity features, making it a comprehensive and explainable quality metric for human activity AGVs.The extensive experimental results show that GHVQ outperforms existing quality metrics on the Human-AGVQA dataset by a large margin, demonstrating its efficacy in assessing the quality of human activity AGVs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The Human-AGVQA dataset and GHVQ metric will be released in public at https://github.com/zczhang-sjtu/GHVQ.git <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.733</span></span></p>

                  <p>Circular-arc graphs are the intersection graphs of arcs of a circle.The main result of this work describes the structure of all \emph{normalized intersection models} of circular-arc graphs.Normalized models of a circular-arc graph reflect the neighborhood relation between its vertices and can be seen as its canonical representations; in particular, any intersection model can be made normalized by possibly extending some of its arcs.We~devise a data-structure, called \emph{PQM-tree}, that maintains the set of all normalized models of a circular-arc graph.We show that the PQM-tree of a circular-arc graph can be computed in linear time.Finally, basing on PQM-trees, we provide a linear-time algorithm for the canonization and the isomorphism problem for circular-arc graphs.

Inspired by this progress, we propose an open-world, direct-prediction model for 3D part segmentation that can be applied zero-shot to any object.Our approach, called Find3D, trains a general-category point embedding model on large-scale 3D assets from the internet without any human annotation.It combines a data engine, powered by foundation models for annotating data, with a contrastive training method.We achieve strong performance and generalization across multiple datasets, with up to a 3x improvement in mIoU over the next best method.Our model is 6x to over 300x faster than existing baselines.To encourage research in general-category open-world 3D part segmentation, we also release a benchmark for general objects and parts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Project website: <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.752</span></span>https://ziqi-ma.github.io/find3dsite/</p>

                  <p>Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) exhibit impressive performance across various multimodal tasks.However, their effectiveness in cross-cultural contexts remains limited due to the predominantly Western-centric nature of most data and models.Conversely, multi-agent models have shown significant capability in solving complex tasks.Our study evaluates the collective performance of LMMs in a multi-agent interaction setting for the novel task of cultural image captioning.Our contributions are as follows: (1) We introduce MosAIC, a Multi-Agent framework to enhance cross-cultural Image Captioning using LMMs with distinct cultural personas; (2) We provide a dataset of culturally enriched image captions in English for images from China, India, and Romania across three datasets: GeoDE, GD-VCR, CVQA; (3) We propose a culture-adaptable metric for evaluating cultural information within image captions; and (4) We show that the multi-agent interaction outperforms single-agent models across different metrics, and offer valuable insights for future research.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our dataset and models can be accessed at https://github.com/MichiganNLP/MosAIC. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.733</span></span></p>

                  <p>Accurate and fast recognition of forgeries is an issue of great importance in the fields of artificial intelligence, image processing and object detection.Recognition of forgeries of facial imagery is the process of classifying and defining the faces in it by analyzing real-world facial images.This process is usually accomplished by extracting features from an image, using classifier algorithms, and correctly interpreting the results.Recognizing forgeries of facial imagery correctly can encounter many different challenges.For example, factors such as changing lighting conditions, viewing faces from different angles can affect recognition performance, and background complexity and perspective changes in facial images can make accurate recognition difficult.Despite these difficulties, significant progress has been made in the field of forgery detection.Deep learning algorithms, especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have significantly improved forgery detection performance.   This study focuses on image processing-based forgery detection using Fake-Vs-Real-Faces (Hard)[10] and 140k Real and Fake Faces<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>[61] data sets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.928</span></span>Both data sets consist of two classes containing real and fake facial images.In our study, two lightweight deep learning models are proposed to conduct forgery detection using these images.Additionally, 8 different pretrained CNN architectures were tested on both data sets and the results were compared with newly developed lightweight CNN models.It's shown that the proposed lightweight deep learning models have minimum number of layers.It's also shown that the proposed lightweight deep learning models detect forgeries of facial imagery accurately, and computationally efficiently.Although the data set consists only of face images, the developed models can also be used in other two-class object recognition problems.</p>

                  <p>Planning with partial observation is a central challenge in embodied AI.A majority of prior works have tackled this challenge by developing agents that physically explore their environment to update their beliefs about the world state.In contrast, humans can $\textit{imagine}$ unseen parts of the world through a mental exploration and $\textit{revise}$ their beliefs with imagined observations.Such updated beliefs can allow them to make more informed decisions, without necessitating the physical exploration of the world at all times.To achieve this human-like ability, we introduce the $\textit{Generative World Explorer (Genex)}$, an egocentric world exploration framework that allows an agent to mentally explore a large-scale 3D world (e.g., urban scenes) and acquire imagined observations to update its belief.This updated belief will then help the agent to make a more informed decision at the current step.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To train $\textit{Genex}$, we create a synthetic urban scene dataset, Genex-DB. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.716</span></span>Our experimental results demonstrate that (1) $\textit{Genex}$ can generate high-quality and consistent observations during long-horizon exploration of a large virtual physical world and (2) the beliefs updated with the generated observations can inform an existing decision-making model (e.g., an LLM agent) to make better plans.</p>

                  <p>Text-to-image diffusion model is a popular paradigm that synthesizes personalized images by providing a text prompt and a random Gaussian noise.While people observe that some noises are ``golden noises'' that can achieve better text-image alignment and higher human preference than others, we still lack a machine learning framework to obtain those golden noises.To learn golden noises for diffusion sampling, we mainly make three contributions in this paper.First, we identify a new concept termed the \textit{noise prompt}, which aims at turning a random Gaussian noise into a golden noise by adding a small desirable perturbation derived from the text prompt.Following the concept, we first formulate the \textit{noise prompt learning} framework that systematically learns ``prompted'' golden noise associated with a text prompt for diffusion models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Second, we design a noise prompt data collection pipeline and collect a large-scale \textit{noise prompt dataset}~(NPD) that contains 100k pairs of random noises and golden noises with the associated text prompts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.838</span></span>With the prepared NPD as the training dataset, we trained a small \textit{noise prompt network}~(NPNet) that can directly learn to transform a random noise into a golden noise.The learned golden noise perturbation can be considered as a kind of prompt for noise, as it is rich in semantic information and tailored to the given text prompt.Third, our extensive experiments demonstrate the impressive effectiveness and generalization of NPNet on improving the quality of synthesized images across various diffusion models, including SDXL, DreamShaper-xl-v2-turbo, and Hunyuan-DiT.Moreover, NPNet is a small and efficient controller that acts as a plug-and-play module with very limited additional inference and computational costs, as it just provides a golden noise instead of a random noise without accessing the original pipeline.</p>

                  <p>Consider the following stochastic matching problem.Given a graph $G=(V, E)$, an unknown subgraph $G_p = (V, E_p)$ is realized where $E_p$ includes every edge of $E$ independently with some probability $p \in (0, 1]$. The goal is to query a sparse subgraph $H$ of $G$, such that the realized edges in $H$ include an approximate maximum matching of $G_p$.   This problem has been studied extensively over the last decade due to its numerous applications in kidney exchange, online dating, and online labor markets.For any fixed $\epsilon > 0$, [BDH STOC'20] showed that any graph $G$ has a subgraph $H$ with $\text{quasipoly}(1/p) = (1/p)^{\text{poly}(\log(1/p))}$ maximum degree, achieving a $(1-\epsilon)$-approximation.A major open question is the best approximation achievable with $\text{poly}(1/p)$-degree subgraphs.A long line of work has progressively improved the approximation in the $\text{poly}(1/p)$-degree regime from .5[BDH+ EC'15] to .501[AKL EC'17], .656<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>[BHFR SODA'19], .666 <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.78</span></span>[AB SOSA'19], .731[BBD SODA'22] (bipartite graphs), and most recently to .68[DS '24].In this work, we show that a $\text{poly}(1/p)$-degree subgraph can obtain a $(1-\epsilon)$-approximation for any desirably small fixed $\epsilon > 0$, achieving the best of both worlds.   Beyond its quantitative improvement, a key conceptual contribution of our work is to connect local computation algorithms (LCAs) to the stochastic matching problem for the first time.While prior work on LCAs mainly focuses on their out-queries (the number of vertices probed to produce the output of a given vertex), our analysis also bounds the in-queries (the number of vertices that probe a given vertex).We prove that the outputs of LCAs with bounded in- and out-queries (in-n-out LCAs for short) have limited correlation, a property that our analysis crucially relies on and might find applications beyond stochastic matchings.</p>

                  <p>Significant advances have been made in natural language processing in recent years.However, our current deep learning approach to language modeling requires substantial resources in terms of data and computation.One of the side effects of this data-hungry paradigm is the current schism between languages, separating those considered high-resource, where most of the development happens and resources are available, and the low-resource ones, which struggle to attain the same level of performance and autonomy.This study aims to introduce a new set of resources to stimulate the future development of neural text generation in Portuguese.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we document the development of GigaVerbo, a concatenation of deduplicated Portuguese text corpora amounting to 200 billion tokens. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.726</span></span>Via this corpus, we trained a series of decoder-transformers named Tucano.Our models perform equal or superior to other Portuguese and multilingual language models of similar size in several Portuguese benchmarks.The evaluation of our models also reveals that model performance on many currently available benchmarks used by the Portuguese NLP community has little to no correlation with the scaling of token ingestion during training, highlighting the limitations of such evaluations when it comes to the assessment of Portuguese generative language models.All derivatives of our study are openly released on GitHub and Hugging Face.See https://nkluge-correa.github.io/Tucano/</p>

                  <p>When unsure about an answer, humans often respond with more words than necessary, hoping that part of the response will be correct.We observe a similar behavior in large language models (LLMs), which we term "Verbosity Compensation" (VC).VC is harmful because it confuses the user understanding, leading to low efficiency, and influences the LLM services by increasing the latency and cost of generating useless tokens.In this paper, we present the first work that defines and analyzes Verbosity Compensation, explores its causes, and proposes a simple mitigating approach.We define Verbosity Compensation as the behavior of generating responses that can be compressed without information loss when prompted to write concisely.Our experiments, conducted on five datasets of knowledge and reasoning-based QA tasks with 14 newly developed LLMs, reveal three conclusions.1) We reveal a pervasive presence of verbosity compensation across all models and all datasets.Notably, GPT-4 exhibits a VC frequency of 50.40%.2)We reveal the large performance gap between verbose and concise responses, with a notable difference of 27.61% on the Qasper dataset.We also demonstrate that this difference does not naturally diminish as LLM capability increases.Both 1) and 2) highlight the urgent need to mitigate the frequency of VC behavior and disentangle verbosity with veracity.We propose a simple yet effective cascade algorithm that replaces the verbose responses with the other model-generated responses.The results show that our approach effectively alleviates the VC of the Mistral model from 63.81% to 16.16% on the Qasper dataset.3) We also find that verbose responses exhibit higher uncertainty across all five datasets, suggesting a strong connection between verbosity and model uncertainty.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our dataset and code are available at https://github.com/psunlpgroup/VerbosityLLM. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.837</span></span></p>

                  <p>Despite significant advancements, segmentation based on deep neural networks in medical and surgical imaging faces several challenges, two of which we aim to address in this work.First, acquiring complete pixel-level segmentation labels for medical images is time-consuming and requires domain expertise.Second, typical segmentation pipelines cannot detect out-of-distribution (OOD) pixels, leaving them prone to spurious outputs during deployment.In this work, we propose a novel segmentation approach exploiting OOD detection that learns only from sparsely annotated pixels from multiple positive-only classes.%but \emph{no background class} annotation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These multi-class positive annotations naturally fall within the in-distribution (ID) set. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.644</span></span>Unlabelled pixels may contain positive classes but also negative ones, including what is typically referred to as \emph{background} in standard segmentation formulations.Here, we forgo the need for background annotation and consider these together with any other unseen classes as part of the OOD set.Our framework can integrate, at a pixel-level, any OOD detection approaches designed for classification tasks.To address the lack of existing OOD datasets and established evaluation metric for medical image segmentation, we propose a cross-validation strategy that treats held-out labelled classes as OOD.Extensive experiments on both multi-class hyperspectral and RGB surgical imaging datasets demonstrate the robustness and generalisation capability of our proposed framework.</p>

                  <p>Moral sentiments expressed in natural language significantly influence both online and offline environments, shaping behavioral styles and interaction patterns, including social media selfpresentation, cyberbullying, adherence to social norms, and ethical decision-making.To effectively measure moral sentiments in natural language processing texts, it is crucial to utilize large, annotated datasets that provide nuanced understanding for accurate analysis and modeltraining.However, existing corpora, while valuable, often face linguistic limitations.To address this gap in the Chinese language domain,we introduce the Moral Foundation Weibo Corpus.This corpus consists of 25,671 Chinese comments on Weibo, encompassing six diverse topic areas.Each comment is manually annotated by at least three systematically trained annotators based on ten moral categories derived from a grounded theory of morality.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To assess annotator reliability, we present the kappa testresults, a gold standard for measuring consistency. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.635</span></span>Additionally, we apply several the latest large language models to supplement the manual annotations, conducting analytical experiments to compare their performance and report baseline results for moral sentiment classification.</p>

                  <p>Software performance modeling plays a crucial role in developing and maintaining software systems.A performance model analytically describes the relationship between the performance of a system and its runtime activities.This process typically examines various aspects of a system's runtime behavior, such as the execution frequency of functions or methods, to forecast performance metrics like program execution time.By using performance models, developers can predict expected performance and thereby effectively identify and address unexpected performance regressions when actual performance deviates from the model's predictions.One common and precise method for capturing performance behavior is software tracing, which involves instrumenting the execution of a program, either at the kernel level (e.g., system calls) or application level (e.g., function calls).However, due to the nature of tracing, it can be highly resource-intensive, making it impractical for production environments where resources are limited.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we propose statistical approaches to reduce tracing overhead by identifying and excluding performance-insensitive code regions, particularly application-level functions, from tracing while still building accurate performance models that can capture performance degradations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span>By selecting an optimal set of functions to be traced, we can construct optimized performance models that achieve an R-2 score of up to 99% and, sometimes, outperform full tracing models (models using non-optimized tracing data), while significantly reducing the tracing overhead by more than 80% in most cases.Our optimized performance models can also capture performance regressions in our studied programs effectively, demonstrating their usefulness in real-world scenarios.Our approach is fully automated, making it ready to be used in production environments with minimal human effort.</p>

Specifically, the DINO-X Pro model achieves 56.0 AP, 59.8 AP, and 52.4 AP on the COCO, LVIS-minival, and LVIS-val zero-shot object detection benchmarks, respectively.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Notably, it scores 63.3 AP and 56.5 AP on the rare classes of LVIS-minival and LVIS-val benchmarks, both improving the previous SOTA performance by 5.8 AP. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.626</span></span>Such a result underscores its significantly improved capacity for recognizing long-tailed objects.</p>

                  <p>We consider the problem of learning an arbitrarily-biased ReLU activation (or neuron) over Gaussian marginals with the squared loss objective.Despite the ReLU neuron being the basic building block of modern neural networks, we still do not understand the basic algorithmic question of whether one arbitrary ReLU neuron is learnable in the non-realizable setting.In particular, all existing polynomial time algorithms only provide approximation guarantees for the better-behaved unbiased setting or restricted bias setting.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our main result is a polynomial time statistical query (SQ) algorithm that gives the first constant factor approximation for arbitrary bias. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span>It outputs a ReLU activation that achieves a loss of $O(\mathrm{OPT})+ \varepsilon$ in time $\mathrm{poly}(d,1/\varepsilon)$, where $\mathrm{OPT}$ is the loss obtained by the optimal ReLU activation.Our algorithm presents an interesting departure from existing algorithms, which are all based on gradient descent and thus fall within the class of correlational statistical query (CSQ) algorithms.We complement our algorithmic result by showing that no polynomial time CSQ algorithm can achieve a constant factor approximation.Together, these results shed light on the intrinsic limitation of gradient descent, while identifying arguably the simplest setting (a single neuron) where there is a separation between SQ and CSQ algorithms.</p>

We use these direct-sum theorems to amplify the sequences from [Lecomte and Weinstein, ESA'20] that separate between Wilber's Alternation and Funnel bounds, increasing the Alternation and Funnel bounds while optimally maintaining the separation.As a corollary, we show that Tango trees<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>[Demaine et al., FOCS'04] are optimal among any BST algorithms that charge their costs to the Alternation bound. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.619</span></span>This is true for any value of the Alternation bound, even values for which Tango trees achieve a competitive ratio of $o(\log \log n)$ instead of the default $O(\log \log n)$.

                  <p>Research on Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches for discrete optimization problems has increased considerably, extending RL to an area classically dominated by Operations Research (OR).Vehicle routing problems are a good example of discrete optimization problems with high practical relevance where RL techniques have had considerable success.Despite these advances, open-source development frameworks remain scarce, hampering both the testing of algorithms and the ability to objectively compare results.This ultimately slows down progress in the field and limits the exchange of ideas between the RL and OR communities.   Here we propose a library composed of multi-agent environments that simulates classic vehicle routing problems.The library, built on PyTorch, provides a flexible modular architecture design that allows easy customization and incorporation of new routing problems.It follows the Agent Environment Cycle ("AEC") games model and has an intuitive API, enabling rapid adoption and easy integration into existing reinforcement learning frameworks.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The library allows for a straightforward use of classical OR benchmark instances in order to narrow the gap between the test beds for algorithm benchmarking used by the RL and OR communities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.689</span></span>Additionally, we provide benchmark instance sets for each environment, as well as baseline RL models and training code.</p>

                  <p>Linearity testing has been a focal problem in property testing of functions.We combine different known techniques and observations about linearity testing in order to resolve two recent versions of this task.   First, we focus on the online manipulations model introduced by Kalemaj, Raskhodnikova and Varma (ITCS 2022 \& Theory of Computing 2023).In this model, up to $t$ data entries are adversarially manipulated after each query is answered.Ben-Eliezer, Kelman, Meir, and Raskhodnikova (ITCS 2024) showed an asymptotically optimal linearity tester that is resilient to $t$ manipulations per query, but their approach fails if $t$ is too large.We extend this result, showing an optimal tester for almost any possible value of $t$. First, we simplify their result when $t$ is small, and for larger values of $t$ we instead use sample-based testers, as defined by Goldreich and Ron (ACM Transactions on Computation Theory 2016).A key observation is that sample-based testing is resilient to online manipulations, but still achieves optimal query complexity for linearity when $t$ is large.We complement our result by showing that when $t$ is \emph{very} large, any reasonable property, and in particular linearity, cannot be tested at all.   Second, we consider linearity over the reals with proximity parameter $\varepsilon$. Fleming and Yoshida (ITCS 2020) gave a tester using $O(1/\varepsilon\ \cdot log(1/\varepsilon))$ queries.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We simplify their algorithms and modify the analysis accordingly, showing an optimal tester that only uses $O(1/\varepsilon)$ queries. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.634</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This modification works for the low-degree testers presented in Arora, Bhattacharyya, Fleming, Kelman, and Yoshida (SODA 2023) as well, resulting in optimal testers for degree-$d$ polynomials, for any constant degree $d$. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.655</span></span></p>

                  <p>Evaluating the output of Large Language Models (LLMs) is one of the most critical aspects of building a performant compound AI system.Since the output from LLMs propagate to downstream steps, identifying LLM errors is crucial to system performance.A common task for LLMs in AI systems is tool use.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While there are several benchmark environments for evaluating LLMs on this task, they typically only give a success rate without any explanation of the failure cases. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.637</span></span>To solve this problem, we introduce SpecTool, a new benchmark to identify error patterns in LLM output on tool-use tasks.Our benchmark data set comprises of queries from diverse environments that can be used to test for the presence of seven newly characterized error patterns.Using SPECTOOL , we show that even the most prominent LLMs exhibit these error patterns in their outputs.Researchers can use the analysis and insights from SPECTOOL to guide their error mitigation strategies.</p>

                  <p>Traditional archival practices for describing electronic theses and dissertations (ETDs) rely on broad, high-level metadata schemes that fail to capture the depth, complexity, and interdisciplinary nature of these long scholarly works.The lack of detailed, chapter-level content descriptions impedes researchers' ability to locate specific sections or themes, thereby reducing discoverability and overall accessibility.By providing chapter-level metadata information, we improve the effectiveness of ETDs as research resources.This makes it easier for scholars to navigate them efficiently and extract valuable insights.The absence of such metadata further obstructs interdisciplinary research by obscuring connections across fields, hindering new academic discoveries and collaboration.In this paper, we propose a machine learning and AI-driven solution to automatically categorize ETD chapters.This solution is intended to improve discoverability and promote understanding of chapters.Our approach enriches traditional archival practices by providing context-rich descriptions that facilitate targeted navigation and improved access.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We aim to support interdisciplinary research and make ETDs more accessible. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span>By providing chapter-level classification labels and using them to index in our developed prototype system, we make content in ETD chapters more discoverable and usable for a diverse range of scholarly needs.Implementing this AI-enhanced approach allows archives to serve researchers better, enabling efficient access to relevant information and supporting deeper engagement with ETDs.This will increase the impact of ETDs as research tools, foster interdisciplinary exploration, and reinforce the role of archives in scholarly communication within the data-intensive academic landscape.</p>

                  <p>We reveal that low-bit quantization favors undertrained large language models (LLMs) by observing that models with larger sizes or fewer training tokens experience less quantization-induced degradation (QiD) when applying low-bit quantization, whereas smaller models with extensive training tokens suffer significant QiD. To gain deeper insights into this trend, we study over 1500 quantized LLM checkpoints of various sizes and at different training levels (undertrained or fully trained) in a controlled setting, deriving scaling laws for understanding the relationship between QiD and factors such as the number of training tokens, model size and bit width.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>With the derived scaling laws, we propose a novel perspective that we can use QiD to measure an LLM's training levels and determine the number of training tokens required for fully training LLMs of various sizes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.666</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, we use the scaling laws to predict the quantization performance of different-sized LLMs trained with 100 trillion tokens. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.679</span></span>Our projection shows that the low-bit quantization performance of future models, which are expected to be trained with over 100 trillion tokens, may NOT be desirable.This poses a potential challenge for low-bit quantization in the future and highlights the need for awareness of a model's training level when evaluating low-bit quantization research.To facilitate future research on this problem, we release all the 1500+ quantized checkpoints used in this work at https://huggingface.co/Xu-Ouyang.</p>
