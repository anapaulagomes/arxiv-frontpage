                  <p>Although large language models (LLMs) are typically aligned, they remain vulnerable to jailbreaking through either carefully crafted prompts in natural language or, interestingly, gibberish adversarial suffixes.However, gibberish tokens have received relatively less attention despite their success in attacking aligned LLMs.Recent work, AmpleGCG~\citep{liao2024amplegcg}, demonstrates that a generative model can quickly produce numerous customizable gibberish adversarial suffixes for any harmful query, exposing a range of alignment gaps in out-of-distribution (OOD) language spaces.To bring more attention to this area, we introduce AmpleGCG-Plus, an enhanced version that achieves better performance in fewer attempts.Through a series of exploratory experiments, we identify several training strategies to improve the learning of gibberish suffixes.Our results, verified under a strict evaluation setting, show that it outperforms AmpleGCG on both open-weight and closed-source models, achieving increases in attack success rate (ASR) of up to 17\% in the white-box setting against Llama-2-7B-chat, and more than tripling ASR in the black-box setting against GPT-4.Notably, AmpleGCG-Plus jailbreaks the newer GPT-4o series of models at similar rates to GPT-4, and, uncovers vulnerabilities against the recently proposed circuit breakers defense.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We publicly release AmpleGCG-Plus along with our collected training datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.825</span></span></p>

                  <p>Personalization in Information Retrieval (IR) is a topic studied by the research community since a long time.However, there is still a lack of datasets to conduct large-scale evaluations of personalized IR; this is mainly due to the fact that collecting and curating high-quality user-related information requires significant costs and time investment.Furthermore, the creation of datasets for Personalized IR (PIR) tasks is affected by both privacy concerns and the need for accurate user-related data, which are often not publicly available.Recently, researchers have started to explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate synthetic datasets, which is a possible solution to generate data for low-resource tasks.In this paper, we investigate the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating synthetic documents to train an IR system for a Personalized Community Question Answering task.To study the effectiveness of IR models fine-tuned on LLM-generated data, we introduce a new dataset, named Sy-SE-PQA.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We build Sy-SE-PQA based on an existing dataset, SE-PQA, which consists of questions and answers posted on the popular StackExchange communities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.848</span></span>Starting from questions in SE-PQA, we generate synthetic answers using different prompt techniques and LLMs.Our findings suggest that LLMs have high potential in generating data tailored to users' needs.The synthetic data can replace human-written training data, even if the generated data may contain incorrect information.</p>

                  <p>Road safety remains a critical challenge worldwide, with approximately 1.35 million fatalities annually attributed to traffic accidents, often due to human errors.As we advance towards higher levels of vehicle automation, challenges still exist, as driving with automation can cognitively over-demand drivers if they engage in non-driving-related tasks (NDRTs), or lead to drowsiness if driving was the sole task.This calls for the urgent need for an effective Driver Monitoring System (DMS) that can evaluate cognitive load and drowsiness in SAE Level-2/3 autonomous driving contexts.In this study, we propose a novel multi-task DMS, termed VDMoE, which leverages RGB video input to monitor driver states non-invasively.By utilizing key facial features to minimize computational load and integrating remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG) for physiological insights, our approach enhances detection accuracy while maintaining efficiency.Additionally, we optimize the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework to accommodate multi-modal inputs and improve performance across different tasks.A novel prior-inclusive regularization method is introduced to align model outputs with statistical priors, thus accelerating convergence and mitigating overfitting risks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We validate our method with the creation of a new dataset (MCDD), which comprises RGB video and physiological indicators from 42 participants, and two public datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.736</span></span>Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of VDMoE in monitoring driver states, contributing to safer autonomous driving systems.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code and data will be released. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.785</span></span></p>

                  <p>In recent years, learned image compression methods have demonstrated superior rate-distortion performance compared to traditional image compression methods.Recent methods utilize convolutional neural networks (CNN), variational autoencoders (VAE), invertible neural networks (INN), and transformers.Despite their significant contributions, a main drawback of these models is their poor performance in capturing local redundancy.Therefore, to leverage global features along with local redundancy, we propose a CNN-based solution integrated with a feature encoding module.The feature encoding module encodes important features before feeding them to the CNN and then utilizes cross-scale window-based attention, which further captures local redundancy.Cross-scale window-based attention is inspired by the attention mechanism in transformers and effectively enlarges the receptive field.Both the feature encoding module and the cross-scale window-based attention module in our architecture are flexible and can be incorporated into any other network architecture.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate our method on the Kodak and CLIC datasets and demonstrate that our approach is effective and on par with state-of-the-art methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.71</span></span></p>

                  <p>Cognitive decline is a natural part of aging, often resulting in reduced cognitive abilities.In some cases, however, this decline is more pronounced, typically due to disorders such as Alzheimer's disease.Early detection of anomalous cognitive decline is crucial, as it can facilitate timely professional intervention.While medical data can help in this detection, it often involves invasive procedures.An alternative approach is to employ non-intrusive techniques such as speech or handwriting analysis, which do not necessarily affect daily activities.This survey reviews the most relevant methodologies that use deep learning techniques to automate the cognitive decline estimation task, including audio, text, and visual processing.We discuss the key features and advantages of each modality and methodology, including state-of-the-art approaches like Transformer architecture and foundation models.In addition, we present works that integrate different modalities to develop multimodal models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also highlight the most significant datasets and the quantitative results from studies using these resources. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.725</span></span>From this review, several conclusions emerge.In most cases, the textual modality achieves the best results and is the most relevant for detecting cognitive decline.Moreover, combining various approaches from individual modalities into a multimodal model consistently enhances performance across nearly all scenarios.</p>

                  <p>Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a powerful approach to align text-to-image (T2I) models with human feedback.Unfortunately, successful application of DPO to T2I models requires a huge amount of resources to collect and label large-scale datasets, e.g., millions of generated paired images annotated with human preferences.In addition, these human preference datasets can get outdated quickly as the rapid improvements of T2I models lead to higher quality images.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we investigate a scalable approach for collecting large-scale and fully synthetic datasets for DPO training. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.738</span></span>Specifically, the preferences for paired images are generated using a pre-trained reward function, eliminating the need for involving humans in the annotation process, greatly improving the dataset collection efficiency.Moreover, we demonstrate that such datasets allow averaging predictions across multiple models and collecting ranked preferences as opposed to pairwise preferences.Furthermore, we introduce RankDPO to enhance DPO-based methods using the ranking feedback.Applying RankDPO on SDXL and SD3-Medium models with our synthetically generated preference dataset ``Syn-Pic'' improves both prompt-following (on benchmarks like T2I-Compbench, GenEval, and DPG-Bench) and visual quality (through user studies).This pipeline presents a practical and scalable solution to develop better preference datasets to enhance the performance of text-to-image models.</p>

                  <p>Conversations often adhere to well-understood social norms that vary across cultures.For example, while "addressing parents by name" is commonplace in the West, it is rare in most Asian cultures.Adherence or violation of such norms often dictates the tenor of conversations.Humans are able to navigate social situations requiring cultural awareness quite adeptly.However, it is a hard task for NLP models.   In this paper, we tackle this problem by introducing a "Cultural Context Schema" for conversations.It comprises (1) conversational information such as emotions, dialogue acts, etc., and (2) cultural information such as social norms, violations, etc.We generate ~110k social norm and violation descriptions for ~23k conversations from Chinese culture using LLMs.We refine them using automated verification strategies which are evaluated against culturally aware human judgements.We organize these descriptions into meaningful structures we call "Norm Concepts", using an interactive human-in-loop framework.We ground the norm concepts and the descriptions in conversations using symbolic annotation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we use the obtained dataset for downstream tasks such as emotion, sentiment, and dialogue act detection. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.736</span></span>We show that it significantly improves the empirical performance.</p>

                  <p>Recent advances in customized video generation have enabled users to create videos tailored to both specific subjects and motion trajectories.However, existing methods often require complicated test-time fine-tuning and struggle with balancing subject learning and motion control, limiting their real-world applications.In this paper, we present DreamVideo-2, a zero-shot video customization framework capable of generating videos with a specific subject and motion trajectory, guided by a single image and a bounding box sequence, respectively, and without the need for test-time fine-tuning.Specifically, we introduce reference attention, which leverages the model's inherent capabilities for subject learning, and devise a mask-guided motion module to achieve precise motion control by fully utilizing the robust motion signal of box masks derived from bounding boxes.While these two components achieve their intended functions, we empirically observe that motion control tends to dominate over subject learning.To address this, we propose two key designs: 1) the masked reference attention, which integrates a blended latent mask modeling scheme into reference attention to enhance subject representations at the desired positions, and 2) a reweighted diffusion loss, which differentiates the contributions of regions inside and outside the bounding boxes to ensure a balance between subject and motion control.Extensive experimental results on a newly curated dataset demonstrate that DreamVideo-2 outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both subject customization and motion control.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset, code, and models will be made publicly available. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.856</span></span></p>

                  <p>As a fundamental operation in modern machine vision models, feature upsampling has been widely used and investigated in the literatures.An ideal upsampling operation should be lightweight, with low computational complexity.That is, it can not only improve the overall performance but also not affect the model complexity.Content-aware Reassembly of Features (CARAFE) is a well-designed learnable operation to achieve feature upsampling.Albeit encouraging performance achieved, this method requires generating large-scale kernels, which brings a mass of extra redundant parameters, and inherently has limited scalability.To this end, we propose a lightweight upsampling operation, termed Dynamic Lightweight Upsampling (DLU) in this paper.In particular, it first constructs a small-scale source kernel space, and then samples the large-scale kernels from the kernel space by introducing learnable guidance offsets, hence avoiding introducing a large collection of trainable parameters in upsampling.Experiments on several mainstream vision tasks show that our DLU achieves comparable and even better performance to the original CARAFE, but with much lower complexity, e.g., DLU requires 91% fewer parameters and at least 63% fewer FLOPs (Floating Point Operations) than CARAFE in the case of 16x upsampling, but outperforms the CARAFE by 0.3% mAP in object detection.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code is available at https://github.com/Fu0511/Dynamic-Lightweight-Upsampling. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span></p>

                  <p>Optimizing data movements during program executions is essential for achieving high performance in modern computing systems.This has been classically modeled with the Red-Blue Pebble Game and its variants.In the existing models, it is typically assumed that the number of red pebbles, i.e., the size of the fast memory, is larger than the maximum in-degree in the computational graph (e.g. an arithmetic circuit).This assumption can be restrictive for many real applications, especially when dealing with "big data" in Machine Learning and Scientific Computing.In this work we study a generalization of the original Red-Blue Pebble Game to allow arbitrary in-degrees, that can be larger than the size of the fast memory.The objective is to minimize the I/O operations by allowing the computation of partial results in the fast memory.We show that this variant of the problem is NP-complete, even for the special case where the computational graph consists of a single level, and only two words fit in the fast memory.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Approximation algorithms for a couple of special cases are also outlined. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span></p>

                  <p>Repository-level code completion has drawn great attention in software engineering, and several benchmark datasets have been introduced.However, existing repository-level code completion benchmarks usually focus on a limited number of languages (<5), which cannot evaluate the general code intelligence abilities across different languages for existing code Large Language Models (LLMs).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Besides, the existing benchmarks usually report overall average scores of different languages, where the fine-grained abilities in different completion scenarios are ignored. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.659</span></span>Therefore, to facilitate the research of code LLMs in multilingual scenarios, we propose a massively multilingual repository-level code completion benchmark covering 18 programming languages (called M2RC-EVAL), and two types of fine-grained annotations (i.e., bucket-level and semantic-level) on different completion scenarios are provided, where we obtain these annotations based on the parsed abstract syntax tree.Moreover, we also curate a massively multilingual instruction corpora M2RC- INSTRUCT dataset to improve the repository-level code completion abilities of existing code LLMs.Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our M2RC-EVAL and M2RC-INSTRUCT.</p>

                  <p>Protecting intellectual property (IP) in federated learning (FL) is increasingly important as clients contribute proprietary data to collaboratively train models.Model watermarking, particularly through backdoor-based methods, has emerged as a popular approach for verifying ownership and contributions in deep neural networks trained via FL.By manipulating their datasets, clients can embed a secret pattern, resulting in non-intuitive predictions that serve as proof of participation, useful for claiming incentives or IP co-ownership.However, this technique faces practical challenges: client watermarks can collide, leading to ambiguous ownership claims, and malicious clients may exploit watermarks to inject harmful backdoors, jeopardizing model integrity.To address these issues, we propose Sanitizer, a server-side method that ensures client-embedded backdoors cannot be triggered on natural queries in harmful ways.It identifies subnets within client-submitted models, extracts backdoors throughout the FL process, and confines them to harmless, client-specific input subspaces.This approach not only enhances Sanitizer's efficiency but also resolves conflicts when clients use similar triggers with different target labels.Our empirical results demonstrate that Sanitizer achieves near-perfect success in verifying client contributions while mitigating the risks of malicious watermark use.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, it reduces GPU memory consumption by 85% and cuts processing time by at least 5 times compared to the baseline. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span></p>

                  <p>With the advances of AI research, AI has been increasingly adopted in numerous domains, ranging from low-stakes daily tasks such as movie recommendations to high-stakes tasks such as medicine, and criminal justice decision-making.Explainability is becoming an essential requirement for people to understand, trust and adopt AI applications.   Despite a vast collection of explainable AI (XAI) algorithms produced by the AI research community, successful examples of XAI are still relatively scarce in real-world AI applications.This can be due to the gap between what the XAI is designed for and how the XAI is actually perceived by end-users.As explainability is an inherently human-centered property, in recent years, the XAI field is starting to embrace human-centered approaches and increasingly realizing the importance of empirical studies of XAI design by involving human subjects.   To move a step towards a systematic review of empirical study for human-centered XAI design, in this survey, we first brief the technical landscape of commonly used XAI algorithms in existing empirical studies.Then we analyze the diverse stakeholders and needs-finding approaches.Next, we provide an overview of the design space explored in the current human-centered XAI design.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Further, we summarize the evaluation metrics based on evaluation goals. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span>Afterward, we analyze the common findings and pitfalls derived from existing studies.For each chapter, we provide a summary of current challenges and research opportunities.Finally, we conclude the survey with a framework for human-centered XAI design with empirical studies.</p>

We present B-Side, a static binary analysis tool able to identify a superset of the system calls that an x86-64 static/dynamic executable may invoke at runtime.B-Side assumes no access to program/libraries sources, and shows a good degree of precision by leveraging symbolic execution, combined with a heuristic to detect system call wrappers, which represent an important source of precision loss in existing works.B-Side also allows to statically detect phases of execution in a program in which different filtering rules can be applied.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We validate B-Side and demonstrate its higher precision compared to state-of-the-art works: over a set of popular applications, B-Side's average $F_1$ score is 0.81, vs. 0.31 and 0.53 for competitors. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.722</span></span>Over 557 static and dynamically-compiled binaries taken from the Debian repositories, B-Side identifies an average of 43 system calls, vs. 271 and 95 for two state-of-the art competitors.We further evaluate the strictness of the phase-based filtering policies that can be obtained with B-Side.</p>

                  <p>Performative prediction (PP) is a framework that captures distribution shifts that occur during the training of machine learning models due to their deployment.As the trained model is used, its generated data could cause the model to evolve, leading to deviations from the original data distribution.The impact of such model-induced distribution shifts in the federated learning (FL) setup remains unexplored despite being increasingly likely to transpire in real-life use cases.Although Jin et al. (2024) recently extended PP to FL in a straightforward manner, the resulting model only converges to a performative stable point, which may be far from optimal.The methods in Izzo et al. (2021); Miller et al. (2021) can find a performative optimal point in centralized settings, but they require the performative risk to be convex and the training data to be noiseless, assumptions often violated in realistic FL systems.This paper overcomes all of these shortcomings and proposes Performative robust optimal Federated Learning (ProFL), an algorithm that finds performative optimal points in FL from noisy and contaminated data.We present the convergence analysis under the Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition, which applies to non-convex objectives.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on multiple datasets validate our proposed algorithms' efficiency. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.661</span></span></p>

                  <p>Sample-efficient online reinforcement learning often uses replay buffers to store experience for reuse when updating the value function.However, uniform replay is inefficient, since certain classes of transitions can be more relevant to learning.While prioritization of more useful samples is helpful, this strategy can also lead to overfitting, as useful samples are likely to be more rare.In this work, we instead propose a prioritized, parametric version of an agent's memory, using generative models to capture online experience.This paradigm enables (1) densification of past experience, with new generations that benefit from the generative model's generalization capacity and (2) guidance via a family of "relevance functions" that push these generations towards more useful parts of an agent's acquired history.We show this recipe can be instantiated using conditional diffusion models and simple relevance functions such as curiosity- or value-based metrics.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our approach consistently improves performance and sample efficiency in both state- and pixel-based domains. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.633</span></span>We expose the mechanisms underlying these gains, showing how guidance promotes diversity in our generated transitions and reduces overfitting.We also showcase how our approach can train policies with even higher update-to-data ratios than before, opening up avenues to better scale online RL agents.</p>

                  <p>Dataset distillation has demonstrated strong performance on simple datasets like CIFAR, MNIST, and TinyImageNet but struggles to achieve similar results in more complex scenarios.In this paper, we propose EDF (emphasizes the discriminative features), a dataset distillation method that enhances key discriminative regions in synthetic images using Grad-CAM activation maps.Our approach is inspired by a key observation: in simple datasets, high-activation areas typically occupy most of the image, whereas in complex scenarios, the size of these areas is much smaller.Unlike previous methods that treat all pixels equally when synthesizing images, EDF uses Grad-CAM activation maps to enhance high-activation areas.From a supervision perspective, we downplay supervision signals that have lower losses, as they contain common patterns.Additionally, to help the DD community better explore complex scenarios, we build the Complex Dataset Distillation (Comp-DD) benchmark by meticulously selecting sixteen subsets, eight easy and eight hard, from ImageNet-1K. In particular, EDF consistently outperforms SOTA results in complex scenarios, such as ImageNet-1K subsets.Hopefully, more researchers will be inspired and encouraged to improve the practicality and efficacy of DD.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and benchmark will be made public at https://github.com/NUS-HPC-AI-Lab/EDF. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.64</span></span></p>

                  <p>Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) typically involves updating at least a few billions of parameters.A more parameter-efficient approach is Prompt Tuning (PT), which updates only a few learnable tokens, and differently, In-Context Learning (ICL) adapts the model to a new task by simply including examples in the input without any training.When applying optimization-based methods, such as fine-tuning and PT for few-shot learning, the model is specifically adapted to the small set of training examples, whereas ICL leaves the model unchanged.This distinction makes traditional learning methods more prone to overfitting; in contrast, ICL is less sensitive to the few-shot scenario.While ICL is not prone to overfitting, it does not fully extract the information that exists in the training examples.This work introduces Context-aware Prompt Tuning (CPT), a method inspired by ICL, PT, and adversarial attacks.We build on the ICL strategy of concatenating examples before the input, but we extend this by PT-like learning, refining the context embedding through iterative optimization to extract deeper insights from the training examples.We carefully modify specific context tokens, considering the unique structure of input and output formats.Inspired by adversarial attacks, we adjust the input based on the labels present in the context, focusing on minimizing, rather than maximizing, the loss.Moreover, we apply a projected gradient descent algorithm to keep token embeddings close to their original values, under the assumption that the user-provided data is inherently valuable.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our method has been shown to achieve superior accuracy across multiple classification tasks using various LLM models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.608</span></span></p>

This work aims to fill the gap in research on intersectional users' software-related perspectives and provide software practitioners with a starting point to address their ethical concerns.We aggregated and analyzed the intersectional users' ethical concerns over time and developed a prioritization method to identify critical concerns.To achieve this, we collected posts from over 700 intersectional subreddits discussing software applications, utilized deep learning to identify ethical concerns in these posts, and employed state-of-the-art techniques to analyze their content in relation to time and priority.Our findings revealed that intersectional communities report \textit{critical} complaints related to cyberbullying, inappropriate content, and discrimination, highlighting significant flaws in modern software, particularly for intersectional users.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Based on these findings, we discuss how to better address the ethical concerns of intersectional users in software development. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span></p>
