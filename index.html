                  <p>Lensless imaging offers a significant opportunity to develop ultra-compact cameras by removing the conventional bulky lens system.However, without a focusing element, the sensor's output is no longer a direct image but a complex multiplexed scene representation.Traditional methods have attempted to address this challenge by employing learnable inversions and refinement models, but these methods are primarily designed for 2D reconstruction and do not generalize well to 3D reconstruction.We introduce GANESH, a novel framework designed to enable simultaneous refinement and novel view synthesis from multi-view lensless images.Unlike existing methods that require scene-specific training, our approach supports on-the-fly inference without retraining on each scene.Moreover, our framework allows us to tune our model to specific scenes, enhancing the rendering and refinement quality.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To facilitate research in this area, we also present the first multi-view lensless dataset, LenslessScenes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.782</span></span>Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms current approaches in reconstruction accuracy and refinement quality.Code and video results are available at https://rakesh-123-cryp.github.io/Rakesh.github.io/</p>

                  <p>Converting webpage design into functional UI code is a critical step for building websites, which can be labor-intensive and time-consuming.To automate this design-to-code transformation process, various automated methods using learning-based networks and multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have been proposed.However, these studies were merely evaluated on a narrow range of static web pages and ignored dynamic interaction elements, making them less practical for real-world website deployment.   To fill in the blank, we present the first systematic investigation of MLLMs in generating interactive webpages.Specifically, we first formulate the Interaction-to-Code task and build the Interaction2Code benchmark that contains 97 unique web pages and 213 distinct interactions, spanning 15 webpage types and 30 interaction categories.We then conduct comprehensive experiments on three state-of-the-art (SOTA) MLLMs using both automatic metrics and human evaluations, thereby summarizing six findings accordingly.Our experimental results highlight the limitations of MLLMs in generating fine-grained interactive features and managing interactions with complex transformations and subtle visual modifications.We further analyze failure cases and their underlying causes, identifying 10 common failure types and assessing their severity.Additionally, our findings reveal three critical influencing factors, i.e., prompts, visual saliency, and textual descriptions, that can enhance the interaction generation performance of MLLMs.Based on these findings, we elicit implications for researchers and developers, providing a foundation for future advancements in this field.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Datasets and source code are available at https://github.com/WebPAI/Interaction2Code. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.87</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) struggle to follow instructions with complex constraints in format, length, etc.Following the conventional instruction-tuning practice, previous works conduct post-training on complex instruction-response pairs generated by feeding complex instructions to advanced LLMs.However, even advanced LLMs cannot follow complex instructions well, thus limiting the quality of generated data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we find that existing datasets inherently contain implicit complex constraints and propose a novel data generation technique, constraint back-translation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.76</span></span>Specifically, we take the high-quality instruction-response pairs in existing datasets and only adopt advanced LLMs to add complex constraints already met by the responses to the instructions, which naturally reduces costs and data noise.In the experiments, we adopt Llama3-70B-Instruct to back-translate constraints and create a high-quality complex instruction-response dataset, named CRAB.We present that post-training on CRAB improves multiple backbone LLMs' complex instruction-following ability, evaluated on extensive instruction-following benchmarks.We further find that constraint back-translation also serves as a useful auxiliary training objective in post-training.Our code, data, and models will be released to facilitate future research.</p>

                  <p>Road safety remains a critical challenge worldwide, with approximately 1.35 million fatalities annually attributed to traffic accidents, often due to human errors.As we advance towards higher levels of vehicle automation, challenges still exist, as driving with automation can cognitively over-demand drivers if they engage in non-driving-related tasks (NDRTs), or lead to drowsiness if driving was the sole task.This calls for the urgent need for an effective Driver Monitoring System (DMS) that can evaluate cognitive load and drowsiness in SAE Level-2/3 autonomous driving contexts.In this study, we propose a novel multi-task DMS, termed VDMoE, which leverages RGB video input to monitor driver states non-invasively.By utilizing key facial features to minimize computational load and integrating remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG) for physiological insights, our approach enhances detection accuracy while maintaining efficiency.Additionally, we optimize the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework to accommodate multi-modal inputs and improve performance across different tasks.A novel prior-inclusive regularization method is introduced to align model outputs with statistical priors, thus accelerating convergence and mitigating overfitting risks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We validate our method with the creation of a new dataset (MCDD), which comprises RGB video and physiological indicators from 42 participants, and two public datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.736</span></span>Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of VDMoE in monitoring driver states, contributing to safer autonomous driving systems.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code and data will be released. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.785</span></span></p>

                  <p>Imitation learning from human demonstrations is an effective paradigm for robot manipulation, but acquiring large datasets is costly and resource-intensive, especially for long-horizon tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this issue, we propose SkillMimicGen (SkillGen), an automated system for generating demonstration datasets from a few human demos. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.836</span></span>SkillGen segments human demos into manipulation skills, adapts these skills to new contexts, and stitches them together through free-space transit and transfer motion.We also propose a Hybrid Skill Policy (HSP) framework for learning skill initiation, control, and termination components from SkillGen datasets, enabling skills to be sequenced using motion planning at test-time.We demonstrate that SkillGen greatly improves data generation and policy learning performance over a state-of-the-art data generation framework, resulting in the capability to produce data for large scene variations, including clutter, and agents that are on average 24% more successful.We demonstrate the efficacy of SkillGen by generating over 24K demonstrations across 18 task variants in simulation from just 60 human demonstrations, and training proficient, often near-perfect, HSP agents.Finally, we apply SkillGen to 3 real-world manipulation tasks and also demonstrate zero-shot sim-to-real transfer on a long-horizon assembly task.Videos, and more at https://skillgen.github.io.</p>

                  <p>Cognitive decline is a natural part of aging, often resulting in reduced cognitive abilities.In some cases, however, this decline is more pronounced, typically due to disorders such as Alzheimer's disease.Early detection of anomalous cognitive decline is crucial, as it can facilitate timely professional intervention.While medical data can help in this detection, it often involves invasive procedures.An alternative approach is to employ non-intrusive techniques such as speech or handwriting analysis, which do not necessarily affect daily activities.This survey reviews the most relevant methodologies that use deep learning techniques to automate the cognitive decline estimation task, including audio, text, and visual processing.We discuss the key features and advantages of each modality and methodology, including state-of-the-art approaches like Transformer architecture and foundation models.In addition, we present works that integrate different modalities to develop multimodal models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also highlight the most significant datasets and the quantitative results from studies using these resources. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.725</span></span>From this review, several conclusions emerge.In most cases, the textual modality achieves the best results and is the most relevant for detecting cognitive decline.Moreover, combining various approaches from individual modalities into a multimodal model consistently enhances performance across nearly all scenarios.</p>

                  <p>We present a novel image-based adaptive domain decomposition FEM framework to accelerate the solution of continuum damage mechanics problems.The key idea is to use image-processing techniques in order to identify the moving interface between the healthy subdomain and unhealthy subdomain as damage propagates, and then use an iterative Schur complement approach to efficiently solve the problem.The implementation of the algorithm consists of several modular components.Following the FEM solution of a load increment, the damage detection module is activated, a step that is based on several image-processing operations including colormap manipulation and morphological convolution-based operations.Then, the damage tracking module is invoked, to identify the crack growth direction using geometrical operations and ray casting algorithm.This information is then passed into the domain decomposition module, where the domain is divided into the healthy subdomain which contains only undamaged elements, and the unhealthy subdomain which comprises both damaged and undamaged elements.Continuity between the two regions is restored using penalty constraints.The computational savings of our method stem from the Schur complement, which allows for the iterative solution of the system of equations appertaining only to the unhealthy subdomain.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through an exhaustive comparison between our approach and single domain computations, we demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of the framework. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span>We ensure its compatibility against local and non-local damage laws, structured and unstructured meshes, as well as in cases where different damage paths eventually merge.Since the key novelty lies in using image processing tools to inform the decomposition, our framework can be readily extended beyond damage mechanics and model several classes of non-linear problems such as plasticity and phase-field.</p>

                  <p>We present a centralized auction algorithm to solve the Multi-Depot Rural Postman Problem with Rechargeable and Reusable Vehicles (MD-RPP-RRV), focusing on rescheduling arc routing after vehicle failures.The problem involves finding heuristically obtained best feasible routes for multiple rechargeable and reusable vehicles with capacity constraints capable of performing multiple trips from multiple depots, with the possibility of vehicle failures.Our algorithm auctions the failed trips to active (non-failed) vehicles through local auctioning, modifying initial routes to handle dynamic vehicle failures efficiently.When a failure occurs, the algorithm searches for the best active vehicle to perform the failed trip and inserts the trip into that vehicle's route, which avoids a complete rescheduling and reduces the computational effort.We compare the algorithm's solutions against offline optimal solutions obtained from solving a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation using the Gurobi solver; this formulation assumes that perfect information about the vehicle failures and failure times is given.The results demonstrate that the centralized auction algorithm produces solutions that are, in some cases, near optimal; moreover, the execution time for the proposed approach is much more consistent and is, for some instances, orders of magnitude less than the execution time of the Gurobi solver.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The theoretical analysis provides an upper bound for the competitive ratio and computational complexity of our algorithm, offering a formal performance guarantee in dynamic failure scenarios. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.633</span></span></p>

                  <p>Texturing is a crucial step in the 3D asset production workflow, which enhances the visual appeal and diversity of 3D assets.Despite recent advancements in Text-to-Texture (T2T) generation, existing methods often yield subpar results, primarily due to local discontinuities, inconsistencies across multiple views, and their heavy dependence on UV unwrapping outcomes.To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel generation-refinement 3D texturing framework called MVPaint, which can generate high-resolution, seamless textures while emphasizing multi-view consistency.MVPaint mainly consists of three key modules.1) Synchronized Multi-view Generation (SMG).Given a 3D mesh model, MVPaint first simultaneously generates multi-view images by employing an SMG model, which leads to coarse texturing results with unpainted parts due to missing observations.2) Spatial-aware 3D Inpainting (S3I).To ensure complete 3D texturing, we introduce the S3I method, specifically designed to effectively texture previously unobserved areas.3) UV Refinement (UVR).Furthermore, MVPaint employs a UVR module to improve the texture quality in the UV space, which first performs a UV-space Super-Resolution, followed by a Spatial-aware Seam-Smoothing algorithm for revising spatial texturing discontinuities caused by UV unwrapping.Moreover, we establish two T2T evaluation benchmarks: the Objaverse T2T benchmark and the GSO T2T benchmark, based on selected high-quality 3D meshes from the Objaverse dataset and the entire GSO dataset, respectively.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experimental results demonstrate that MVPaint surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.649</span></span>Notably, MVPaint could generate high-fidelity textures with minimal Janus issues and highly enhanced cross-view consistency.</p>

                  <p>The low-orbit mega-constellation network (LMCN) is an important part of the space-air-ground integrated network system.An effective satellite-ground interconnection design can result in a stable constellation topology for LMCNs.A naive solution is accessing the satellite with the longest remaining service time (LRST), which is widely used in previous designs.The Coordinated Satellite-Ground Interconnecting (CSGI), the state-of-the-art algorithm, coordinates the establishment of ground-satellite links (GSLs).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Compared with existing solutions, it reduces latency by 19% and jitter by 70% on average. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.612</span></span>However, CSGI only supports the scenario where terminals access only one satellite and cannot fully utilize the multi-access capabilities of terminals.Additionally, CSGI's high computational complexity poses deployment challenges.To overcome these problems, we propose the Classification-based Longest Remaining Service Time (C-LRST) algorithm.C-LRST supports the actual scenario with multi-access capabilities.It adds optional paths during routing with low computational complexity, improving end-to-end communications quality.We conduct our 1000s simulation from Brazil to Lithuania on the open-source platform Hypatia.Experiment results show that compared with CSGI, C-LRST reduces the latency and increases the throughput by approximately 60% and 40%, respectively.In addition, C-LRST's GSL switching number is 14, whereas CSGI is 23.C-LRST has better link stability than CSGI.</p>

                  <p>Bilevel optimization problems are characterized by an interactive hierarchical structure, where the upper level seeks to optimize its strategy while simultaneously considering the response of the lower level.Evolutionary algorithms are commonly used to solve complex bilevel problems in practical scenarios, but they face significant resource consumption challenges due to the nested structure imposed by the implicit lower-level optimality condition.This challenge becomes even more pronounced as problem dimensions increase.Although recent methods have enhanced bilevel convergence through task-level knowledge sharing, further efficiency improvements are still hindered by redundant lower-level iterations that consume excessive resources while generating unpromising solutions.To overcome this challenge, this paper proposes an efficient dynamic resource allocation framework for evolutionary bilevel optimization, named DRC-BLEA.Compared to existing approaches, DRC-BLEA introduces a novel competitive quasi-parallel paradigm, in which multiple lower-level optimization tasks, derived from different upper-level individuals, compete for resources.A continuously updated selection probability is used to prioritize execution opportunities to promising tasks.Additionally, a cooperation mechanism is integrated within the competitive framework to further enhance efficiency and prevent premature convergence.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results compared with chosen state-of-the-art algorithms demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.742</span></span>Specifically, DRC-BLEA achieves competitive accuracy across diverse problem sets and real-world scenarios, while significantly reducing the number of function evaluations and overall running time.</p>

This paper introduces ARQ, an innovative mixed-precision quantization method that not only preserves the clean accuracy of the smoothed classifiers but also maintains their certified robustness.ARQ uses reinforcement learning to find accurate and robust DNN quantization, while efficiently leveraging randomized smoothing, a popular class of statistical DNN verification algorithms, to guide the search process.   We compare ARQ with multiple state-of-the-art quantization techniques on several DNN architectures commonly used in quantization studies: ResNet-20 on CIFAR-10, ResNet-50 on ImageNet, and MobileNetV2 on ImageNet.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We demonstrate that ARQ consistently performs better than these baselines across all the benchmarks and the input perturbation levels. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.619</span></span>In many cases, the performance of ARQ quantized networks can reach that of the original DNN with floating-point weights, but with only 1.5% instructions.</p>

                  <p>3D models have recently been popularized by the potentiality of end-to-end training offered first by Neural Radiance Fields and most recently by 3D Gaussian Splatting models.The latter has the big advantage of naturally providing fast training convergence and high editability.However, as the research around these is still in its infancy, there is still a gap in the literature regarding the model's scalability.In this work, we propose an approach enabling both memory and computation scalability of such models.More specifically, we propose an iterative pruning strategy that removes redundant information encoded in the model.We also enhance compressibility for the model by including in the optimization strategy a differentiable quantization and entropy coding estimator.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results on popular benchmarks showcase the effectiveness of the proposed approach and open the road to the broad deployability of such a solution even on resource-constrained devices. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.668</span></span></p>

                  <p>Visual content and accompanied audio signals naturally formulate a joint representation to improve audio-visual (AV) related applications.While studies develop various AV representation learning frameworks, the importance of AV data alignment is usually undermined for achieving high-quality representation.We observe that an audio signal may contain background noise interference.Also, non-synchronization may appear between audio and video streams.These non-strict data alignment limits representation quality and downgrade application performance.In this paper, we propose to improve AV joint representations from a data-centric perspective by aligning audio signals to visual data.Our alignment is conducted in an agentic workflow controlled by an LLM-based assistant named AVAgent.For each input AV data pair, our AVAgent uses a multi-modal LLM to convert audio and visual data into language descriptions separately (i.e., tool use).Then, AVAgent reasons whether this paired data is aligned well and plans to edit the audio signal if needed (i.e., planning).The audio editing is executed by predefined actions that filter noise or augment data.Moreover, we use a VLM to evaluate how modified audio signals match the visual content and provide feedback to AVAgent (i.e., reflection).The tool use, planning, and reflection steps operate cyclically to become an agentic workflow where audio signals are gradually aligned to visual content.To this end, existing methods can directly leverage the aligned AV data via our agentic workflow to improve AV joint representations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The experimental results comprehensively demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed approach against previous baselines in diverse downstream tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.64</span></span></p>

We show that the core can be approximated only under structured loss functions, and even then, the best approximation we are able to establish, using an adaptation of the GreedyCapture algorithm developed for centroid clustering[Chen et al., 2019; Micha and Shah, 2020], is unappealing for a natural loss function.In contrast, we design a new (inefficient) algorithm, GreedyCohesiveClustering, which achieves the relaxation FJR exactly under arbitrary loss functions, and show that the efficient GreedyCapture algorithm achieves a constant approximation of FJR.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also design an efficient auditing algorithm, which estimates the FJR approximation of any given clustering solution up to a constant factor. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span>Our experiments on real data suggest that traditional clustering algorithms are highly unfair, whereas GreedyCapture is considerably fairer and incurs only a modest loss in common clustering objectives.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential to enhance software development through automated code generation and refactoring, reducing development time and improving code quality.This study empirically evaluates StarCoder2, an LLM optimized for code generation, in refactoring code across 30 open-source Java projects.We compare StarCoder2's performance against human developers, focusing on (1) code quality improvements, (2) types and effectiveness of refactorings, and (3) enhancements through one-shot and chain-of-thought prompting.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results indicate that StarCoder2 reduces code smells by 20.1% more than developers, excelling in systematic issues like Long Statement and Magic Number, while developers handle complex, context-dependent issues better. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span>One-shot prompting increases the unit test pass rate by 6.15% and improves code smell reduction by 3.52%.Generating five refactorings per input further increases the pass rate by 28.8%, suggesting that combining one-shot prompting with multiple refactorings optimizes performance.These findings provide insights into StarCoder2's potential and best practices for integrating LLMs into software refactoring, supporting more efficient and effective code improvement in real-world applications.</p>

                  <p>Turing completeness has made Ethereum smart contracts attractive to blockchain developers and attackers alike.To increase code security, many tools can now spot most known vulnerabilities$-$at the cost of production efficiency.Recent studies show false-positive ratios over 99% in state-of-the-art technologies: this makes them impractical for use in industry and have raised questions on the direction of academic research.In this work we show how integrating and extending current analyses is not only feasible, but also a next logical step in smart-contract security.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We propose light-weight static checks on the morphology and dynamics of Solidity code, stemming from a developer-centric notion of vulnerability, that we use to verify the output of other tools, flag potential false alarms, and suggest verifications. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>Besides technical details we implemented an open-source prototype.For three top-10 vulnerabilities it flags 324 warnings of other tools as false-positives, in 60 verified de-duplicated smart contracts selected from the blockchain by the presence of true (and false) vulnerabilities.This amounts to a 92%- to 100%-reduction in the number of false-positives for these vulnerabilities.</p>
